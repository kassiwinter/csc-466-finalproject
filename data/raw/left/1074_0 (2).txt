The Department of Health and Human Services is set to announce that it is changing the 2015 open enrollment period for the new federal health-care exchanges, according to an HHS official, the latest on-the-fly change for the embattled Affordable Care Act.While the 2015 enrollment period had been set to begin Oct. 15, 2014 and end Dec. 7, it will now begin Nov. 15, 2014, and end Jan. 15, 2015.The new change will, notably, push the open enrollment period until after the 2014 election, which will be held Nov. 4 -- a circumstance that has Republicans crying foul.
