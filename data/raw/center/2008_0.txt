WASHINGTON—Rep.         Jason Chaffetz    (R., Utah), a high-profile and popular committee chairman, said Sunday he will run to be the next House speaker, adding an unpredictable dynamic into the race.Mr. Chaffetz, who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is considered a long shot to overtake Majority Leader         Kevin McCarthy    in the contest to succeed Rep.         John Boehner    as speaker. But Mr. Chaffetz’s official entrance into the race applies new pressure to Mr. McCarthy to contend with restive conservatives in the House who want to take a harder line in dealing with President Barack Obama and Democrats. “I think the American public wants to see a change. They want a fresh start,” Mr. Chaffetz said on Fox. “You don’t just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership team; that doesn’t signal change. I think they want a fresh face and a fresh new person who’s actually there at the leadership table in the speaker’s role.”     House Republicans are expected to select Mr. McCarthy, of California, as their nominee to be the next speaker in leadership elections scheduled for this Thursday. But the candidacy of Mr. Chaffetz could inject new drama into the subsequent speaker election on the House floor, when lawmakers from both parties can vote.               A candidate must win a majority of all votes cast for individuals to be elected speaker. With Democrats expected to vote for Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        as speaker, Mr. McCarthy could afford to lose 28 of 246 House Republicans (not including Mr. Boehner) and still win the post, assuming all members voted. If no one wins a majority, the House repeats the roll-call vote until a speaker is elected.     Mr. Chaffetz acknowledged Sunday on Fox that Mr. McCarthy has the majority of votes of the members of the Republican conference, and he said he would vote for whomever the group chooses as its nominee. But he said he doubts Mr. McCarthy would have enough GOP support to get elected speaker on the House floor, predicting Sunday that as many as 50 Republicans might not vote for Mr. McCarthy on the House floor.     In addition to Messrs. McCarthy and Chaffetz, Rep. Daniel Webster (R., Fla.) is also running for speaker.     ”Kevin McCarthy has the votes within the House Republican conference to win the speaker’s position,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.) said Friday. “What happens on the floor of the House of Representatives remains to be seen.”     Some Republicans have begun discussing punitive measures for GOP lawmakers who vote for someone other than the party’s nominee on the House floor, but none have been officially established yet.      Republicans have been mulling other changes to their rules. Reps. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.) and Jim Renacci (R., Ohio) suggested delaying any elections other than the speaker’s race in a letter being circulated. On Sunday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, said all elections remained scheduled for Thursday.      Mr. McCarthy stumbled in the past week when he suggested a panel formed to investigate the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, had achieved a political victory in causing         Hillary Clinton’s    approval ratings to fall. The comments gave Democrats fodder to say that the panel is a politically motivated attempt to discredit Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks.     Republicans have long said their only motivation for years of hearings was to uncover the truth behind what happened in Benghazi.     Mr. Chaffetz said Thursday that Mr. McCarthy should apologize for the comments.     “I’m very supportive of Kevin McCarthy, but those statements are just absolutely inappropriate; they should be withdrawn,” Mr. Chaffetz said on MSNBC. Mr. McCarthy’s office issued a statement saying the investigations weren’t politically motivated.     Mr. McCarthy’s supporters said the Benghazi comments were unlikely to alter the dynamic of the leadership election.     “Some people are using it as an opening to get in the race. That’s fine. This is politics,” Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.) said Sunday on ABC. “I don’t think it’s going to change how anybody votes.”     Mr. Chaffetz was the subject of a report in the past week that dozens of Secret Service employees shared personal information about him at a time the Republican lawmaker was publicly criticizing the agency for a series of missteps. Mr. Chaffetz had applied to join the Secret Service in 2003 but wasn’t hired.     The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Secret Service, concluded that last March and April, about 45 employees accessed Mr. Chaffetz’s old records on about 60 different occasions. At the time, Mr. Chaffetz was leading congressional hearings examining security lapses in protecting the president.     ”Kevin McCarthy is very much the sociable, get-along guy. Jason is much more driven by policy,” Rep.         Peter King    (R., N.Y.) said Friday. Mr. King said he has already pledged his support to Mr. McCarthy to be the next speaker, but said that Mr. Chaffetz was “a credible candidate.”     Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com     Corrections & Amplifications:   Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the past week suggested a panel formed to investigate the 2012 Benghazi attacks had achieved a political victory in causing Hillary Clinton’s approval rating to sink An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the time period.
