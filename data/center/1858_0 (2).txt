Former Florida Gov.         Jeb Bush    is poised to formally begin his bid for the Republican presidential nomination June 15 in Miami, capping a six-month precandidacy that rewrote the rules of presidential politics.After flagging his ambitions in December and launching a super PAC the following month, Mr. Bush, the son and brother of two American presidents, embarked on a fundraising campaign that he claimed broke records in its first 100 days. He isn’t the only contender to solicit funds for a super PAC before announcing his candidacy, but he has been the most aggressive, building a full-blown political machine and national campaign faster than rivals who spent years laying the groundwork for their bids. Once Mr. Bush formally declares, he won’t be able to coordinate with the super PAC.         Read More on Capital JournalCapital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news        Mr. Bush, who last ran for office in 2002, is planning to establish a dual-coast political operation, with the PAC based in Los Angeles and the campaign in Miami.                He is set to announce his candidacy at Miami-Dade College, the largest community college in the country, reflecting his longtime passion for education and attachment to the multicultural community he has called home for decades. Mr. Bush speaks fluent Spanish, is married to a Mexican-American and boasts strong ties with the fast-rising Hispanic community—credentials that could win him favor after two elections in which the GOP nominee drew little support among minority voters.     The announcement will come after a trip to Europe next week, Mr. Bush’s first time abroad as a presumptive candidate, and will end a phase in which he traveled the country headlining $100,000-per-person receptions and giving stump speeches while insisting he hadn’t made up his mind on whether to run.     After officially declaring, Mr. Bush will travel to the four states that hold the earliest nominating contests—New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada—in an effort to show his plans to compete across the board.           The watchdog groups Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center said Thursday they won’t drop complaints that Mr. Bush is in violation of campaign law by delaying his announcement in order to raise uncapped donations for his super PAC. Once Mr. Bush becomes an official candidate, he is prohibited him from soliciting more than $5,000 per person for the super PAC and $2,700 per person for his primary-election campaign.     Despite all his efforts to raise money for the super PAC, Mr. Bush will have only 15 days to send a clear signal about his fundraising prowess as an official candidate because he will have to report his second-quarter fundraising haul to the Federal Election Commission by the end of June. The super PAC, meanwhile, doesn’t have to report until the end of July.     His team is already gearing up for a big fundraising push, with a call this Friday and events scheduled in New York and Washington, D.C., days after he announces.     The Bush campaign is trying to recruit donors to raise $27,000 by the end of the month, the deadline for his first fundraising quarter as an official candidate. Supporters who meet reach that dollar amount will be invited to a mid-July retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, home to the Bush family compound, according to an invitation circulated by his finance team.     Mr. Bush has built a formidable fundraising operation and a leading position in early polls in several states. But he has struggled at times to define himself apart from his brother, former President George W. Bush, and he has reframed his answer several times when asked whether he would have sent U.S. troops to Iraq had he known the country didn’t possess weapons of mass destruction. He trails several rivals among the conservatives who make up a large chunk of the primary electorate and has been outpolled by other candidates in surveys of GOP voters in Iowa, whose caucuses start the nominating process in February.     “The race right now is very fluid,” said         Eric Fehrnstrom,    a senior adviser to 2012 GOP nominee         Mitt Romney.    “Republican primary polling is bouncing up and down like the heart of a patient with atrial fibrillation.”     Mr. Fehrnstrom added that the candidates should be “building a campaign for the long haul in terms of message, money and institutional support, and on those measurements I think Jeb Bush is in good shape.”                                                                                                                                                     With former Secretary of State         Hillary Clinton    viewed as the likely Democratic nominee, Mr. Bush’s entry will test voters’ appetite for candidates with familiar names and long experience in the public eye over younger rivals. Mr. Bush’s welcoming stances on immigration and the Common Corenational education standards are at odds with many in the GOP, which has shifted rightward in recent years. Those policy stances will test Mr. Bush’s assertion that a successful candidate must be “willing to lose the primary to win the general [election] without violating your principles.”      Mr. Bush backs granting legal status for undocumented workers, a view at odds with the conservative base. While he supports the Common Core standards for English and math, saying they will help raise student achievement, some conservatives say the standards will lead to federal intrusion into local schools.      In one of the first Republican primaries in decades without an heir apparent, Mr. Bush is a fragile front-runner. For months, he has hovered at or near the top of the national polls, the benchmark used to help determine eligibility in televised debates. But the surname of the 62-year-old Mr. Bush is a stumbling block for many voters wary of political dynasties or critical of the previous Bush administrations, and rivals are pitching themselves as a fresher generation of leadership.      Among the less ideologically driven political establishment, Mr. Bush is viewed as a top-tier contender. He hails from Florida, the nation’s largest swing state and one that is critical to the Republican nominee’s success. His status as a former two-term governor could draw supporters among those who believe President         Barack Obama,    a former one-term U.S. senator, took office with insufficient executive experience.     Miami-Dade College awards degrees to more Hispanics and African-Americans than any other institution in the U.S., providing a fitting backdrop for Mr. Bush’s message that anyone, regardless of their background, has the “right to rise,” as his super PAC is called.
