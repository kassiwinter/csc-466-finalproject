He was held captive by armed Taliban militants until his release in 2014 in exchange for five terrorists.President Trump has slammed Bergdahl as a “no-good traitor,” saying he “should have been executed.”During his campaign, Trump proposed returning Bergdahl to the Taliban."Let's fly him over. We'll dump him right in the middle. Throw him out of the plane. Should we give him a parachute or not?" Trump said at a 2015 rally. "I say no. Don't give him a parachute. Why would we want to waste a parachute?"Bergdahl's lawyers have argued that Trump's comments have made it impossible for Bergdahl to get a fair trial. In a January court filing, they wrote that Trump has "transformed his rallies into a televised traveling lynch mob."
