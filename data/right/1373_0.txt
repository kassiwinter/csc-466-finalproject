                 | October 08, 2020 03:40 PM                A top conservative radio host whose adamant support of President Trump helped galvanize his election in 2016 scored a virtual visit from the commander in chief himself.       On his radio show Thursday afternoon, Rush Limbaugh said Trump will join him on the airwaves Friday as part of a "virtual rally."            “I’m thrilled to announce that our commander in chief, President Donald Trump, will be right here tomorrow hosting the largest virtual rally in radio history,” Limbaugh said during his show on Thursday. “It will be special, and I am really looking forward to it.”      Trump has been eager to resume campaigning only a week after he tested positive for COVID-19 a week ago, and Limbaugh's show provides an opportunity for the president to address his supporters remotely. Trump participated in his first TV interview since getting sick with Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo on Thursday morning, when he said he would not participate in a virtual debate against Joe Biden next week.      Limbaugh, who, according to Talkers Magazine, broadcasts to more than 15 million daily listeners, was an ardent supporter of Trump in 2016 and has been credited with using his large reach to influence the 2016 election in the president's favor.       Trump awarded Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom during February's State of the Union speech following news that the conservative radio host had been diagnosed with lung cancer.
