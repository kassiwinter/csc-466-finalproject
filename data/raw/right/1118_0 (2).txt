PolitiFact.com, the Tampa Bay Times's "fact checking" operation, is out with its "Lie of the Year," and it's a doozy of dishonesty: "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.' "Just to show how fast the news can move, back in September this columnist tweeted: "If 'I didn't set a red line' isn't named 'Lie of the Year,' @PolitiFact is a state propaganda agency." "I didn't set a red line"--the reference was to Syria's use of chemical weapons, in case you've forgotten--didn't even make the top 10. Yet our September tweet proved to be mistaken: We cannot fault PolitiFact for the lie it chose instead. Which isn't to say PolitiFact doesn't function as a state propaganda agency. For in the past--when it actually mattered, which is to say before ObamaCare became first a law and then a practical reality--PolitiFact vouched for Barack Obama's Big Lie.     In her lie-of-the-year write-up, PolitiFact's Angie Holan includes the following acknowledgment:               In 2009 and again in 2012, PolitiFact rated Obama's statement Half True, which means the statement is partially correct and partially wrong. We noted that while the law took pains to leave some parts of the insurance market alone, people were not guaranteed to keep insurance through thick and thin. It was likely that some private insurers would continue to force people to switch plans, and that trend might even accelerate. Her "half true" acknowledgment is itself a half-truth. As the Washington Examiner's Sean Higgins noted last month, in October 2008 PolitiFact rated the same statement, from then-candidate Obama, as flatly "true," on the ground that "Obama is accurately describing his health care plan here."                                                 PolitiFact is on the left.          Getty Images                                                                                                             We're not making this up. PolitiFact actually rated Obama's promise as "true" on the ground that in making the promise, he was making the promise.     To be sure, there are some epistemological complexities here. The cancellation letters from insurance companies provide concrete proof that Obama's claim was false, evidence that was necessarily lacking in 2008, 2009 and 2012. Likewise, the reporting of our colleagues on the news side of The Wall Street Journal established with a previously lacking specificity that Obama told the lie with full knowledge and intent to deceive.     One might have reasonably suspected, in 2008 and certainly in 2009 and 2012, that Obama was lying. But one could not prove it, because it was not yet a factual assertion. In 2008 it was but a promise, which Obama might or might not have intended and might or might not have been able to keep. By 2012, we now know, it was a full-fledged fraud, but exposing it conclusively as such would have required a degree of expertise few journalists have.     In other words, it's not that PolitiFact was wrong to withhold its jejune "pants on fire" designation from the Obama statement in 2008, 2009 and 2012. It was wrong even to make a pretense of "fact checking" a statement that was, at the time, not a factual claim. Its past evaluations of the statement were not "fact checks" at all, merely opinion pieces endorsing ObamaCare.     Lots of people wrote opinion pieces endorsing ObamaCare, and some are still at it. Apart from the substance of the arguments, there's nothing wrong with that. But selling opinion pieces by labeling them "fact checks" is fundamentally dishonest. In this case, it was in the service of the most massive consumer fraud in American history.     Ezra Klein's Shining Path  	PolitiFact might have stopped shilling for ObamaCare while the stopping was good, but the same can't be said for those who openly write opinion pieces. The Washington Post's Ezra Klein is still at it with another one of those tiresome posts accusing Republicans of "hypocrisy" because ObamaCare includes some ideas that have had some support from some Republicans at some times in the past.     For all we know, he makes some good arguments (not that we'd bet on it). We stopped reading after the opening clause: "Now that HealthCare.Gov is on a clear path to functionality . . ." He can't possibly outdo that. It's reminiscent of Gen. William Westmoreland declaring "the light at the end of the tunnel" in Vietnam. And of course another way of saying "on a clear path to functionality" is "still not functional."     Just how far from functionality it is is suggested by a look at the supposed successes. Yesterday the left-liberal site TalkingPointsMemo.com featured a hilarious map--we know that sounds like an oxymoron, but check it out--suggesting that the only ObamaCare success story--a bright-red state in a sea of white, with a few faint pink islands--was Washington state, which runs its own exchange and where ObamaCare has supposedly enrolled more than 18% of the "eligible population," the vast majority in Medicaid.     The Puget Sound Business Journal pours some cold water on the frequently rainy region:     The on-again, off-again technology problems at the Washington state health exchange may have serious repercussions for Medicaid enrollees, who could lose coverage if the problems keep them from recertifying their eligibility. . . . People on Medicaid must recertify that they're financially eligible for coverage once a year or their coverage is terminated. In November, for the first time, Medicaid enrollees were required to recertify through the exchange's Healthplanfinder website. It's an entirely new process for people who were familiar with the old, on-paper process for maintaining coverage. In November, only about 30,000 managed to recertify (down from the average 60,000). Starting Dec. 1, about 23,000 people lost health care coverage. So far, 18,000 of those people are still without coverage, HCA officials said. Meanwhile, the New York Times has a report on "many in New York's professional and cultural elite," who "have long supported President Obama's health care plan," but "now, to their surprise . . . are learning that their health insurance plans are being canceled."     These are freelancers who belonged to group plans set up by professional associations. Under ObamaCare, "they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies." That means higher premiums, higher deductibles and inferior coverage.     The piece closes with what to us is a savory slice of Schadenfreude:     It is an uncomfortable position for many members of the creative classes to be in. "We are the Obama people," said Camille Sweeney, a New York writer and member of the Authors Guild. Her insurance is being canceled, and she is dismayed that neither her pediatrician nor her general practitioner appears to be on the exchange plans. What to do has become a hot topic on Facebook and at dinner parties frequented by her fellow writers and artists. "I'm for it," she said. "But what is the reality of it?" Damn you, reality!     Exhortation and Action      "Nancy Pelosi on Deal: 'Embrace the Suck' "--headline, Politico.com, Dec. 12  "This is a good moment to advocate greater executive branch power because we've just seen a monumental example of executive branch incompetence: the botched Obamacare rollout."--David Brooks, New York Times, Dec. 12  No Stats Allowed  	In yesterday's column we mentioned that we were unable to find the original version of the piece we criticized in our lead item, in which MLive.com's Jen Eyer laid out a series of rules for discussion of racial subjects. A couple of readers with superior Internet skills managed to find a cached copy, and here's the quote in question:     Unless the story is about crime statistics, these comments will be removed as off-topic and inflammatory unless the story is actually about crime statistics. As well as being repetitious, that shows our tweet suggesting Eyer was banning discussion of crime statistics was at worst a mild exaggeration, as well as being repetitious.     Eyer, meanwhile, tweeted to us this morning: "@jamestaranto Your readers are charming. Thanks for sending them my way!" That was accompanied by an image of a foul comment--we won't quote it, but you can see it at the link if you're curious--that appears to have been posted to MLive.com.     The comment, as we said, is foul. We don't know if it was posted by a reader of this column, but either way we certainly don't approve, nor do we fault Eyer for (presumably) deleting it. It occurs to us, however, that (1) blaming this columnist for somebody else's message is just the sort of personal attack that Eyer is at pains to avoid in her role as moderator, as well as the kind of guilt by association to which she strenuously objects in the context of racial discussions; and (2) exhibiting the ugly comment on her Twitter feed defeats the purpose of deleting it.

The prospect of a wedding between the two leaders got the Twitterverse tweeting. "This is why the Oxford comma exists!" said Carole Blake, a literary agent in London. The Oxford comma, also known as a serial comma, refers to the practice of putting a comma between the penultimate item in a list and the conjunction that ties together the list. The Wall Street Journal doesn't use the serial comma, so we would write "X, Y and Z." The Oxford High Street Journal, by contrast, would write "X, Y, and zed."     The Sky News tweet could have used an Oxford comma, but making it a rule creates problems of its own. Years ago when we worked on the Journal's op-ed desk, we received a submission from a writer who argued that the Oxford comma should be universally adopted so as to avoid ambiguities. We wrote back: "My boss, Max Boot, and I find your argument unpersuasive. Do two or three people find it unpersuasive?"     Of course the question would really be a stumper if we'd written the preceding sentence in the first-person plural.      Follow @jamestaranto on Twitter.
