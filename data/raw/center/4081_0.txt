The Justice Department said Friday that special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    final report won’t be released next week, tamping down speculation that the end of the investigation into a Trump connection to Russian election interference is imminent. But Mr. Mueller is widely believed to be in the final stages of his sprawling investigation and is expected to deliver his report to Attorney General         William Barr    in the coming weeks. That doesn’t necessarily mean the public will get a full accounting of his work any time soon. Nor does the end of Mr. Mueller’s probe mean other criminal investigations involving President Trump and his associates are wrapping up. Here’s a look at where the case stands and what could happen next. Where does the Mueller investigation stand?     Mr. Mueller has for nearly two years been investigating whether the Trump campaign aided Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election—an allegation that President Trump has repeatedly denied. The special counsel’s inquiry has led to criminal charges against 34 people, including six Trump associates, five of whom have been convicted.     There are signs that Mr. Mueller’s investigation is drawing to a close: Many of the prosecutors on his team are returning to other Justice Department offices, and the sentencing of cooperating defendants is moving ahead.         Matthew Whitaker,    who oversaw the probe as acting attorney general, also told reporters in January that the case was nearing its conclusion in rare public comments on the probe’s timeline.               As part of the regulation governing Mr. Mueller’s work, he must submit a report “at the conclusion” of his investigation to the attorney general explaining his charging decisions—including explanations of cases he investigated but decided not to bring charges.     Mr. Barr must then report to Congress about the investigation but is only required to notify specific lawmakers that the investigation has concluded, and describe any instances in which he vetoed a decision by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Barr can release the report publicly if he decides it is “in the public interest” but will likely spend days or weeks determining what he is able to release.                                         Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report could be released in the next few days, but what actually happens when he sends his report is not cut and dried. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

Previous independent counsels have often issued lengthy reports on their findings, but there is no indication whether Mr. Mueller will take a similar approach, and there is no requirement that he do so. Much of the evidence his team has collected came through a grand jury, and prosecutors are generally barred from disclosing such information except in formal charges. If Mr. Mueller interprets that regulation literally, he may write only a short document for the attorney general. That means he will already have disclosed in court filings the bulk of what he has found.     Who will see Mr. Mueller’s report?     Democrats and some Republicans have expressed concern about political interference from Mr. Trump and his allies and urged Mr. Barr to release the special counsel’s final report in full. Mr. Barr has said he wants to bring as much transparency as possible to Mr. Mueller’s findings but has stopped short of promising to release a report in its entirety. During his confirmation hearing, he told lawmakers that per the regulation, he anticipates two different reports: a confidential one for his use only, and a second one that he will assemble for congressional leaders and the public. The confidential report from Mr. Mueller to Mr. Barr would contain details about why Mr. Mueller did or didn’t pursue criminal charges, which the Justice Department typically refuses to publicly discuss.          Will a filing of a report mean the case is closed?     Mr. Barr’s receipt of the report effectively means Mr. Mueller’s office is shutting down. But it will have no impact on several other criminal investigations, including one in New York, where federal prosecutors are probing whether Mr. Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee misspent some of the record $107 million it raised from donations. Court cases involving people charged by Mr. Mueller, including former Trump adviser         Roger Stone,    will continue with prosecutors from the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, even after Mr. Mueller closes up shop.     Will the report answer the collusion question once and for all?     Not likely in such stark terms. The report more likely will outline Mr. Mueller’s work and let readers draw their own conclusions. The indictments he has brought paint a picture of an aggressive, multipronged operation by Russia to interfere in the election, and efforts by people in and around the Trump campaign to pursue outreach to Russia and later lie to investigators about it. But don’t expect Mr. Mueller’s report to silence the political debate over Mr. Trump and Russia.     What would happen next?     Congressional investigations into Mr. Trump’s potential ties to Russia will continue. Among them, the House Intelligence Committee said this month it was reopening its investigation into Russian election interference and said it would include questions about whether any foreign government has leverage over Mr. Trump. In addition, congressional committees could seek Mr. Mueller’s testimony or the underlying materials from his probe as part of their oversight of the Justice Department and the special counsel.     —Byron Tau contributed to this article.
