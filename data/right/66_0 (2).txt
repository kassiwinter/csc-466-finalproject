        The jury has spoken. Derek Chauvin is guilty on all charges. Now it’s time for politicians to do what they haven’t done so far — act responsibly. President Biden was completely wrong to weigh in on Tuesday, saying that he was praying for a guilty verdict. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was of course worse, saying crowds should get “more confrontational” if former officer Chauvin was found not guilty. It was incitement, and it’s shameful that Democrats defeated a censure vote against her. Because of their actions, this national nightmare will drag on, as Chauvin likely will file an appeal saying he didn’t get a fair trial. The judge certainly thought that would happen. Chauvin killed George Floyd. His act of kneeling on Floyd’s neck was horrific. The prosecution presented the case well. The jury did their duty. 
But while Chauvin is a disgrace to his profession, he does not represent his entire profession, as progressive politicians would have you believe. The Squad and far too many New York politicians think his prosecution is just the first step. They would “defund” every cop, and take away the people keeping us safe.

Nor do his actions represent the entire country, as Biden shamefully said after the verdict, saying Floyd’s death “ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism … The systemic racism is a stain on our nation’s soul.” President Biden and Rep. Maxine Waters both weighed in on Derek Chauvin’s trial.AP The justice system worked, but the left — with Biden’s blessing — wants to convince you it’s not worth saving. Rather than trying to heal a nation, they’re trying to tear it apart.
