Still peeved at being out-organized by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in Colorado, GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump is crying foul and blaming the system for his campaign's failures."These are dirty tricksters! This is a dirty trick," he said at a campaign stop in Rome, New York, on Tuesday evening, blasting the GOP after all 34 of Colorado's delegates went to Cruz. "The RNC, the Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen!"In a separate interview with The Hill on Tuesday, Trump accused Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus for rigging the rules against him.â€œIt's a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what's going on," Trump said.Priebus reacted to Trump's comments on Twitter."The rules were set last year. Nothing mysterious. Nothing new. The rules have not changed. The rules are the same. Nothing different," he wrote.Trump's campaign in Colorado was caught flatfooted, in some instances failing to present accurate delegate slates to its supporters. When his campaign attempted to reprint another copy of the slate, that version, too, contained errors.In a Tuesday town hall on CNN, Trump again blamed his party for the outcome.'Colorado is unfortunate, because they disenfranchised the voters. They disenfranchised all of these voters in Colorado," he said.Signs You May Suffer From Being A Trump Supporter
