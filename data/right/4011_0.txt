UPDATE: Republicans like Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) say Trump should forge ahead, asking what, exactly, does Pelosi not want Americans to hear?#ShutdownNancy shut down the government, and now #SOTU. What are Democrats afraid of Americans hearing? That 17,000+ criminals were caught last year at the border? 90% of heroin in the US comes across the southern border? Illegal border crossings dropped 90%+ in areas w/ a wall? https://t.co/PzIQ3kxapM— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 16, 2019Actually, he answered the question for her.This decision makes clear what we already know: Democrats are only interested in obstructing @realDonaldTrump, not governing.— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 16, 2019ORIGINAL POSTGiven that we are now in the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is requesting that President Trump delay his State of the Union address.Today, I wrote to @realDonaldTrump recommending that we delay the State of the Union until after government re-opens, as the @SecretService, the lead federal agency for #SOTU security, faces its 26th day without funding. https://t.co/K2oL8WGvqo pic.twitter.com/g3fIlxDbbK— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 16, 2019"Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to Congress on January 29th," Pelosi suggests. The shutdown is now in its 26th day. Neither Trump nor the Democrats will budge on border security. Trump said he'll settle for nothing less than a wall, but Democrats won't offer a penny for it.There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2019It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2019
