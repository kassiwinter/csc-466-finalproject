WASHINGTON—Democratic and White House negotiators resumed discussions over a sweeping coronavirus relief deal Thursday, but gave no indication they were closer to a breakthrough in resolving deep-seated disputes that led President         Trump    to end the negotiations earlier this week.Few on Capitol Hill were optimistic that Congress and the White House would reach an agreement before the Nov. 3 election. Still, negotiations that had been frozen showed signs of life after House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) on Thursday morning ruled out moving forward with special support for the battered airline industry without a broader agreement. In a call Thursday afternoon, Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    made clear that Mr. Trump was interested in reaching an agreement on a broader bill, according to Mrs. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, and an administration official.     The White House has gone back and forth on how broad a deal to pursue. After ruling out more talks Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening and reiterated in recent days that he would support individual relief bills, including aid for airlines and another round of direct checks.               “I shut down talks two days ago because they weren’t working out. Now they‘re starting to work out,” Mr. Trump said Thursday on Fox Business Network. “We’re talking about airlines and we’re talking about a bigger deal than airlines,” he said, mentioning $1,200 stimulus checks as well as unspecified other items.     The two sides have been at odds both over how much money to spend, as well as how to allocate it. Democrats last week passed a $2.2 trillion bill, down from a $3.5 trillion bill passed in May, while Mr. Mnuchin had last week proposed a $1.6 trillion offer.     White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said Thursday that Mr. Trump was interested in legislation that included checks, as well as assistance for small businesses and airlines, but not a larger package. Later, she said the White House was “open to going with something bigger” but not the $2.2 trillion package Democrats proposed. She said that Mr. Trump had made calls from the Oval Office to Republicans on Capitol Hill.     Mr. Trump had faced pushback from Republicans who said it was a mistake to abandon efforts to mitigate the health and economic blows of the pandemic, especially on the eve of an election where control of both the White House and Senate are at stake. Mrs. Pelosi, too, has been under pressure from Democratic lawmakers to remain at the negotiating table, amid signs the labor market recovery is stalling.     Unemployment claims fell slightly to 840,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, well off the peak of nearly seven million in March but still above pre-pandemic highs.     The new focus on a broader bill came after Mrs. Pelosi said aid for airlines, which are facing deep job losses, must go hand-in-hand with a larger package. Airline stocks slid on the news shortly before noon, but recovered by the close of trading, and the S&P 500 edged up 0.8% to its highest level since Sept. 3.     “There is not going to be any stand-alone bill unless there is a bigger bill and it can be part of that, or it could be in addition to these negotiations,” Mrs. Pelosi said of the airline aid, in remarks to reporters. In comments later to Bloomberg, she said that the airline aid and the broader bill “don’t have to happen at the same moment, but it has to be happening with the assurance that we will go beyond this assistance to the airlines.”     Mrs. Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats were open to further talks on a broader deal, but there were few indications that such an agreement could be reached before Election Day.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Thursday he hoped to see negotiations continue but said the impending election was making compromise more difficult.     “We do agree another rescue package is needed. We had vast differences about how much we should spend,” he said at an event in Kentucky.      He noted later that there were still reservations among many Republicans.     “I’ve got a significant percentage of my members who think we’ve done enough and who are alarmed by the amount of national debt,” he said.     Airlines are now at the center of stimulus negotiations after months of intense lobbying for a second round of government funds to continue paying workers. Despite bipartisan support, their efforts so far haven't been enough to break an impasse over elements of a broader pandemic relief package.                                                 Airlines already have received $25 billion in coronavirus aid, under the stipulation that they couldn’t lay off or furlough any workers before Oct. 1.                  Photo:            Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Democrats have generally opposed passing stand-alone bills, saying that approach would leave out some of their top priorities, including funding for state and local governments, food stamp assistance and child care, among others.     The party has, however, been willing to consider a stand-alone airline relief bill. Last week, House Democrats attempted to pass separate legislation to prevent tens of thousands of layoffs in the struggling industry, but it was blocked by Republicans, who said they hadn’t had a chance to vet it. GOP lawmakers argued that the House should have advanced a separate airlines bill with bipartisan support.                                          After an unprecedented drop in air travel due to the coronavirus, passenger airlines are being forced to make long-term, make-or-break decisions at a time of great uncertainty and minimal cash flow. So how are they planning to survive? WSJ finds out. Composite: George Downs/The Wall Street Journal (Originally published July 22, 2020)                                                                                                     Airlines have warned that it will become more difficult to delay or undo changes to their networks the longer they go without aid. Airlines agreed to continue providing service to many small cities as another condition of the aid they received earlier this year.     “We support a larger bill, we think that makes sense for the larger economy,”         American Airlines Group Inc.    Chief Executive         Doug Parker    said on CNBC Thursday. “But what we know is, if that can’t happen before the election, that’s going to have a seriously detrimental impact on our ability to continue to provide essential service to the country.”     Mrs. Pelosi said she had made the case to Democrats that airline workers merited special attention because there were national security concerns and lengthy certification requirements for those jobs, she said on Bloomberg.     Airlines received $25 billion in aid under the Cares Act passed in March. A stipulation of that aid was that the carriers couldn’t lay off or furlough any workers before Oct. 1.     Airlines had hoped they would be on firmer footing by the time that assistance ran out, but travel demand hasn’t bounced back. Passenger volume is down around 70% from a year ago, according to Transportation Security Administration data.          On Thursday morning, two Republican senators signaled concerns with a stand-alone package for airlines, saying it was unsustainable to continue to provide grants to maintain the industry’s payroll.      “No one wants to see layoffs, but we have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer resources are used in an appropriate and equitable manner,” GOP Sens.         Mike Lee    of Utah and         Pat Toomey    of Pennsylvania wrote in a joint statement.      The Senate isn’t expected to convene until the week of Oct. 19 to give several GOP senators time to recover from Covid 19. That leaves only two weeks before the Nov. 3 election, during which Republicans plan to confirm Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett.              Sen. Shelley Moore Capito    (R., W.Va.) said that the Senate should focus on a package like the one it voted on last month rather than legislation targeted at certain types of businesses. The “skinny” bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate.     “I think we should go back to again where we tried to go before which is a more rounded package, not just a one-industry targeted bill because I’m not sure that could even pass on its own,” she said. “There are other industries that are tremendously hurt still.”     —Andrew Duehren, Gordon Lubold and Kate Davidson contributed to this article.
