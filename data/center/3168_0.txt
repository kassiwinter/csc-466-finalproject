They can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases," Obama told Harry on BBC 4 Radio."The question has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a Balkanization of society and allows ways of finding common ground," he continued.The former president went on to emphasize the need for face-to-face contact. "Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interests to convene and get to know each other and connect. But then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighborhood and get to know each other," Obama said. "Because the truth is that on the internet, everything is simplified and when you meet people face-to-face it turns out they're complicated," he added.While the Obama administration often employed the use of Twitter, President TrumpDonald TrumpHillicon Valley — Cyberattack hits Ukrainian defense On The Money — GOP senators block Biden's Fed picks Florida county clerk's typo directed ticketed drivers to site selling Trump merchandise MORE has taken to using the platform to attack his opponents and announce policy changes and proposals, including notably banning transgender individuals from the military.Obama did not mention Trump by name in the interview.The former president issued a warning on social media use earlier this month, asking users to think before they post on platforms. “Michelle was giving the general idea ... that don’t say the first thing that pops in your head.
