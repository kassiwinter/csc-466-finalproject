WASHINGTON—Rep.         John Dingell    of Michigan, the longest-serving lawmaker in the history of Congress, said he planned to retire after nearly six decades, ending a storied and controversial career spent defending both the auto industry and environmental protection laws.The departure of Mr. Dingell, 87 years old, will further winnow the House's ranks of veteran, liberal lawmakers, which were already shrinking after California Democrats         Henry Waxman    and         George Miller    announced earlier this year they don't plan to run for re-election. Mr. Dingell began the first of his 30 House terms in 1955, when he won a special election held after the death of his father, who had held the seat since 1933. His tenure in Congress became the longest in history in June 2013, when he broke the record held by the late Democratic Sen.         Robert Byrd    of West Virginia.     In his 58 years in Congress, Mr. Dingell has been known for his fierce protection of Michigan's auto industry, putting him at odds with the Democratic caucus's commitment to tougher antipollution standards. But he championed liberal policies elsewhere. He had a hand in some of Congress's landmark legislative efforts, including Medicare, the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the 1964 Voting Rights Act—which he said in June was the "single most important vote I cast."

Mr. Dingell said Monday he fought to establish environmental standards that auto makers could meet without going out of business and wiping out jobs.     "There were a lot of uptight environmentalists who couldn't understand that, so they'd run around denouncing me for supporting standards that enabled car companies to make [affordable] cars and preserve jobs," he said in an interview.     As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell worked on legislation to improve the safety of drinking water, address leaking underground storage tanks and improve air quality. Under Mr. Dingell, the committee broadened the scope of its investigations, targeting         Pfizer    and the generic-drug industry among others.     Known as an intimidating presence on oversight panels, Mr. Dingell was notorious for his "Dingell-grams," detailed requests for information that signaled impending investigations—and the accompanying interrogations in the Rayburn Building committee room that now bears his name.     Since Congress convened in 1789, there have been just 26 lawmakers who served 40 years or more in the House. After Mr. Dingell's departure, fellow Michigan Democrat Rep.         John Conyers,    now in his 25th term, will be the longest-serving current House lawmaker.      Mr. Dingell angered Democrats by standing in the way of proposals to more rapidly increase gasoline-mileage standards and by supporting less-aggressive proposals to curb greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. His stance contributed to his ouster as chairman in 2008, when he was successfully challenged by Mr. Waxman.

"He worked hard to piece together strengthening the industrial base, including automotive, and caring for the environment," said Rep.         Sander Levin    (D., Mich.). "He had the ability to work through the difficult meshing of doing both."     Current Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman         Fred Upton    (R., Mich.) said Mr. Dingell tapped his skills as a "wily prosecutor" in drafting bills and getting them passed. "It's a lot more fun when he's on your side," Mr. Upton said in an interview. "When he's an adversary he's certainly a very strong one, but we never made it personal."     Mr. Dingell's congressional record got mixed reviews from the environmental community.     Clean Air Watch President Frank O'Donnell said Mr. Dingell was instrumental in writing the National Environmental Policy Act and clean-water legislation, but "when push came to shove on clean air, he was always Tailpipe Johnny." When Mr. Waxman took over as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in 2008, he was seen as a "breath of fresh air, literally," Mr. O'Donnell said.     Mr. Dingell's wife, Debbie, 60, is said to be considering a bid for his seat, which is likely to stay in Democratic hands. Ms. Dingell is chairwoman of the Wayne State University board of governors and served as a senior executive at         General Motors    for more than 30 years. President Obama won the district with about two-thirds of the vote in 2012. Mr. Dingell declined to divulge his wife's plans. "She can make up her own mind," he said.
