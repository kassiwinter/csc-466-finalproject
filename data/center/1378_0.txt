President Trump’s physician said Mr. Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk, but didn’t say whether he still tests positive for Covid-19, in a memo released hours after the president’s first public remarks since contracting the virus more than a week earlier. Mr. Trump—who didn’t wear a mask—spoke Saturday to supporters on the White House lawn. The president emerged from the White House pumping his fists, to cheers of “USA” from the audience of hundreds of pro-police activists. “I’m feeling great,” he said. In taped videos and brief appearances earlier in the week, the president had at times appeared short of breath, but sounded better in his nearly 20-minute speech. In a memo that evening, Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said diagnostic tests show there is “no longer evidence of actively replicating virus.”                                                 The president emerged from the White House on Saturday to cheers of ‘USA’ from supporters.

He attacked his Democratic rival,      Joe Biden,        as a socialist, touted his own record on the economy and said he wanted to send a message “to police officers of every race, color and creed: we support you, we honor you.” He concluded his remarks by urging supporters to vote.          The event came two weeks after the president hosted a ceremony in the Rose Garden to announce his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, an event that         Anthony Fauci,    director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has described as a superspreader event.      After the president said he had tested positive for Covid-19 last week, more than a dozen advisers and Republican lawmakers have said they too tested positive—at least five of whom attended the Rose Garden event and indoor ceremonies the White House hosted that day.                                                 Many audience members wore red ‘Make America Great Again’ caps.

Saturday’s event marked his first time speaking at length to a crowd. On Monday, he is set to hold a campaign rally in Florida and later in the week will hold rallies in Pennsylvania and Iowa.     The president’s return to the campaign trail comes as most polling shows him trailing Mr. Biden nationally and in battleground states. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken after the Sept. 29 debate, for which Mr. Trump was criticized on his aggressiveness and frequent interruptions, showed Mr. Biden had widened his advantage, leading the president 53% to 39% among registered voters. The survey was taken before Mr. Trump said he had contracted Covid-19.     Medical experts have expressed concern about the president resuming public appearances so soon after contracting a contagious disease. In addition to the threat he could pose to those who attend his events, Mr. Trump travels with an entourage of aides, advisers and Secret Service personnel.                                          Like so much in 2020, the presidential campaign was thrown into turmoil because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Doctors, scientists and public-health experts have warned that while patients who become infected with Covid-19 often gain some form of immunity for a certain period, no one is sure exactly how long immunity to the disease lasts. Some studies have shown declining or undetectable antibodies in Covid-19 patients two or three months after their illness, raising the possibility that patients could be susceptible to reinfection at that point.               Twitter Inc.    attached a warning to the president’s tweet, saying it violated the platform’s rules on spreading misleading or harmful information about Covid-19.     The White House has left central questions about the president’s medical condition unanswered. It hasn’t said outright whether the president continues to test positive for Covid-19 or when he last got a negative test before testing positive on Oct. 1.      People infected with Covid-19 can stop isolating after 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms, as long as they haven’t had a fever in 24 hours and their other symptoms are improving, according to CDC guidelines. For severe cases, the CDC says a person can be contagious for up to 20 days.     Mr. Trump was given a steroid, dexamethasone, typically recommended for severe cases of Covid-19.          In a prerecorded interview with Fox News that aired Friday evening, Mr. Trump said he had been retested for the virus earlier in the day but didn’t know the results. “I know I’m at either the bottom of the scale or free,” he said. Asked if he was still taking medications, Mr. Trump said, “We pretty much finished.”     Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, questioned the claim that Mr. Trump isn't contagious.     “What they’re doing is not giving the result of the test, they’re giving an interpretation,” he said, adding that Dr. Conley’s statement suggests the president continues to test positive.     He took particular issue with Dr. Conley’s mention in his memo of the “decreasing and now undetectable subgenomic mRNA,” which he said relies on a nonstandard test that hasn’t been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. “If we’re not using it on our patients, how can we use it on our president?” Dr. Chin-Hong said.     Dr. Chin-Hong said he would recommend the president isolate for 20 days—which the CDC recommends for severe cases—because of how low Mr. Trump’s blood-oxygen levels had fallen and the fact that he had been prescribed a steroid, which can prolong the amount of time in which a patient is shedding the virus.     He said the president should test negative twice before resuming public appearances.     The D.C. Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Saturday event, which violated the district’s rules prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people. Health officers from Washington and nine other local jurisdictions Thursday sent a letter to those who worked in the White House in the last two weeks, attended events there or were in close contact with people who attended those events—recommending that they be tested for Covid-19 and criticizing the White House for undertaking “limited contact tracing” to date.     The White House has said its contact tracing is robust.     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Saturday’s event took place on federal property. CDC guidelines warn that the more people who are present at an event, the higher the risk is of Covid-19 spreading.     Guests in attendance for the event were being requested to bring a mask with them and would be instructed to wear it on the White House grounds, an official said before the event. All attendees would be given a temperature check and a brief questionnaire about recent symptoms, the official said.     Nearly a week before Saturday’s event, a group placed 20,000 empty chairs outside the White House to commemorate the more than 200,000 lives lost in the U.S. from Covid-19. The death toll is from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which also say the virus has infected more than 7.7 million people in the country.
