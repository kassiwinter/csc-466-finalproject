The Department of Justice will mobilize the FBI in response to a spike in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board members across the country. In a memorandum released Monday evening, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices to meet in the next 30 days with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders to outline strategies for addressing the incidents, which have become more frequent and more volatile in recent months."Threats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation's core values," Garland wrote in a memorandum released Monday evening. "Those who dedicate their time and energy to ensuring that our children receive a proper education in a safe environment deserve to be able to do their work without fear for their safety."The announcement comes just days after the group representing the country's school boards wrote to President Joe Biden to plead for federal assistance in responding to mounting threats and violence that they likened to domestic terrorism against school board members related to their decisions on COVID-19 school safety policies, critical race theory and more. Political Cartoons"In recent months, there has been a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation's public schools," Garland wrote. "While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views."According to the memorandum, the Justice Department will launch a series of efforts in the coming days "designed to address the rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel." A task force, which is set to include representatives from the Justice Department's Criminal Division, National Security Division, Civil Rights Division, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the FBI and more, will determine how federal enforcement tools can be used to prosecute the threats and crimes, and ways to assist state and local law enforcement where threats of violence may not constitute federal crimes.The memo also tasks the Justice Department with creating specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators to help them understand the types of behaviors that constitute threats, how to report threatening conduct and to whom, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution process."Over the last few weeks, school board members and other education leaders have received death threats and have been subjected to threats and harassment, both online and in person," Chip Slaven, the interim executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association, said in a statement Monday evening.Slaven said Garland's swift action is "a strong message to individuals with violent intent who are focused on causing chaos, disrupting our public schools, and driving wedges between school boards and the parents, students, and communities they serve."
