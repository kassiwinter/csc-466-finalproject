           Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning where he launched his latest attacks on Hillary Clinton, calling her "brainwashed" after she acknowledged that she "short-circuited" when making a misstatement. When speaking to members of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in Washington Friday, Clinton sought to "clarify and explain" a statement she made that FBI Director James Comey said that her previous answers about her private email use were "truthful." "I may have short-circuited [her answers] and for that I will try to clarify," Clinton said.
Trump not only labeled her speech as "habitual lying," but he also took to Twitter noting that it's proof she is not fit to be president:
Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."

Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
