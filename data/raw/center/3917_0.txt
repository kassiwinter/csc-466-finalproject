Jeb Bush    urged Americans to celebrate his late father George H.W. Bush’s life and not grieve, and said he hoped the former president’s “kinder, gentler” outlook would prevail despite public and political division.      “Politically, it’s not winning,” Mr. Bush said of his father’s style, which he contrasted with the more combative politics of the current time. “But that’s not to say we shouldn’t restore it.”     He added of his father’s death, “Hopefully it’s not an end of an era.”     Mr. Bush praised President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for their graciousness in preparations for Wednesday’s state funeral for his father, who passed away Friday.                “What people want to talk about is, ‘Well, why isn’t the president giving the eulogy?’ It’s because we have a unique circumstance here—my brother was president,” Mr. Bush said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council’s annual meeting, referring to         George W. Bush.         “I’m sorry,” he added to laughter.      It had been decided that the 43rd president would give the eulogy before Mr. Trump was elected, according to a person close to the family.     Mr. Bush joked that his mother, who died in April, would be looking down, “about ready to slap George if he goes beyond 12 minutes.”                                         Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush discusses his father, the late President George H.W. Bush, and his ability to bring people together. He spoke with Gerald Seib at the WSJ CEO Council.                                                                                                     Despite the political climate, Mr. Bush said there are “a whole lot of people focused on solving problems, and they know that with civility and kindness and compassion and generosity of spirit, you can do far more than pushing people down and making yourself look better, and all of the things that go on [in Washington]. I’m much more optimistic because I don’t come here often.”     Mr. Bush warmly recalled his father’s devotion to family and public service. “He was the most generous, kind person you’d ever meet,” but also a fierce competitor on the campaign trail.     Mr. Bush, a Republican like his father, was Florida governor from 1999-2007 and ran for president in 2016, starting as the presumed front-runner and favorite of the top political donors. He then faced withering attacks from      Donald Trump,        and was abandoned by the conservative base that relished Mr. Trump’s combative style. Mr. Bush, 65 years old, has returned to business consulting and his nonprofit Foundation for Excellence in Education.     “My dad will be surrounded by friends inside the National Cathedral and many that couldn’t get in. The guy has built a network that is pretty amazing,” Mr. Bush said. “People want to share their love for him, and it’s just a great time to be his son.”     Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
