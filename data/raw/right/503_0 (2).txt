        California Gov. Gavin Newsom heads into the Golden State recall Tuesday with the wind at his back after the last polls of the race show voters want to keep him in the job. 
A Survey USA and the San Diego Union-Tribune poll showed 54 percent of likely voters saying Newsom should stay in office, while just 41 percent said they planned to vote “yes” on the recall. A second Berkeley Institute of Government Studies and Los Angeles Times survey showed Newsom coasting by an even bigger margin, with 60 percent of likely voters saying they planned to vote “no” on recall, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. 
Amid simmering anger over the state’s draconian lockdowns and surging crime, voters forced a recall election, hoping to stage a repeat of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2003 victory over incumbent Gray Davis.

The charismatic black radio host has long led the field of potential replacements for Newsom and would likely succeed him as governor if he doesn’t survive the recall challenge.  The latest polls suggest Newsom may have found his footing after a spurt of other surveys showed the recall was gaining ground.

It was personalized,” Berkeley pollster Mark DiCamillo told the Chronicle. “By attacking his challenger, which is Elder, and framing it as ‘Look at what you’ll get if you vote for this guy’ … I think that really won the day.”
