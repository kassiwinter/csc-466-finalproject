FERGUSON, Mo.—Racial tensions exploded in this St. Louis suburb in recent days over the death of 18-year-old         Michael Brown,    an unarmed African-American teenager shot by a Ferguson police officer, but the city of 21,000 residents has wrestled with the issue for decades.The city's population has shifted from almost exclusively white to one that is predominately African-American, while the city leadership and police force has remained mostly white. Federal data show integration in Ferguson has been difficult to achieve. The black population started to grow from a few hundred residents in 1970, to 52% in 2000. Over the next decade, the balance tipped, with the city reaching about 67% African-American and 29% white in 2010.                                         Unrest continued for a fourth night in Ferguson, Mo., as police and protesters clashed over the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.                                                                                                           
Related           Organizations have tried to tackle the issue. People Reaching Out for Unity and Diversity was formed in the mid-1990s to work on fair housing practices and stem the exodus of whites.               (Ferguson shooting: Obama calls for reflection).     Later that decade, Rance Thomas co-founded North County Churches Uniting for Racial Harmony and Justice to work on improving race relations here and in neighboring communities. In the past year, he helped to ease rancor over the exit of a superintendent from the Ferguson-Florissant school district in a controversy that broke at times along racial lines.     "A major factor is race. We have had a great deal of white flight," Mr. Thomas said. "We've had some success, but that's a difficult issue to deal with."     Anger was also stoked in the area when the school district including Normandy High School—the school Mr. Brown attended—was stripped of its state accreditation in 2012.      "You could see some of that tension when Normandy lost its accreditation," said Terrance Cauley, 43, who was demonstrating against violence in the community on Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, scattered violence had broken out, including the shooting of a man by a St. Louis County officer who police say had a handgun pointed at him.     Also on Wednesday, two journalists were arrested in a McDonald's after police asked them to move out of the restaurant, according to the Washington Post, the employer of one of the journalists. They were briefly detained and then released, the news organizations said.     The Ferguson-Florissant school district, which was set to start the year Thursday, said Wednesday it was pushing back the start of classes to Monday, "in response to concerns expressed by many about continuing unrest in our community."     Meanwhile, the family of Mr. Brown and others in the African-American community have been calling for a transparent investigation of the incident, with some saying tensions between the city mostly white police force and predominantly black city have been building for years.     At a community forum hosted by city officials Tuesday, Amy Hunter, a mother of four children, said she has had conversations with her 12-year-old son about how to act when stopped by the police, something she said is a daily concern for black men in greater St. Louis.     Thomas Jackson, chief of the Ferguson police, said he is working to recruit more minority officers and that he would redouble his efforts and look for innovative ways to bring more minorities on the force. Currently, only three of the force's 53 officers are African-American, which he says creates a perceived disconnect between residents and the police force.

In the center of downtown, there are a few upscale bars and shops. But a few miles away, where the bulk of the protests have happened, some businesses have long been boarded up, dispersed among an array of strip malls.     In weeks ahead, attention here is likely to remain focused on the local police department and investigations under way by the St. Louis County police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.     State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who represents Ferguson, hopes outrage will turn into political activity. The six-member city council has one black member, and government data show that while there are about 15,000 residents who are 18 and older in Ferguson, only about 1,500 votes were cast in the council race last year.     "This is a wake-up call," she said.     Write to Mark Peters at mark.peters@wsj.com and Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
