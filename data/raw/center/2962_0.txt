                                       Fox News will no longer air in the United Kingdom, its parent company 21st Century Fox announced, with its U.K. feed ending Tuesday afternoon."21st Century Fox has decided to cease providing a feed of Fox News Channel in the U.K.," the media giant said in a statement."Fox News is focused on the U.S. market and designed for a U.S. audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the U.K.," it continued."We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the U.K."Fox News has faced stiff competition in the U.K. from British-based news organizations including the BBC, ITV and Sky News.In June, U.K. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said a decision to approve 21st Century Fox's proposal to take full control of Sky TV wouldn't be made until it received additional review from Britain's Competition and Markets Authority. Currently, 21st Century Fox owns 39 percent of Sky TV.The news comes as Fox News finished August as the most-watched channel on basic cable in the U.S. for the 14th consecutive month, according to Nielsen Media Research.
