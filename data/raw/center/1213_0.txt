"Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes, " said Donald Trump. He has threatened to veto the bill, which is in any case unlikely to make progress in the Republican-controlled Senate. Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes, without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam....— Donald J.

The bill would require the USPS to treat all official election correspondence as first-class mail.The service would be prohibited until January 2021 from implementing or approving any changes to operations or service levels that would "impede prompt, reliable, and efficient service", including closing or reducing the hours of post offices, removing mail sorting machines and mailboxes, or stopping overtime payments."This is not a partisan issue," Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, the bill's author, said before the debate. "It makes absolutely no sense to impose these kinds of dangerous cuts in the middle of a pandemic and just months before the elections in November.".@USPS provides a critical lifeline by providing universal access to medications, supplies and mail for every single American, no matter where you live. In just a few hours, the House will pass my legislation blocking the Trump Admin’s politicization of this essential service. pic.twitter.com/ElgHpRTbqL— Carolyn B.

No business that I can think of would ever be saddled with what we've done to the Postal Service," she added.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Democrats and their supporters say the cost-cutting measures will hamper mail-in votingThey also condemned Democrats for pursuing for what they said was "an unnecessary bailout plan that does not fix any of the underlying operational issues".On Friday, the postmaster general told a Senate committee there had been "no changes to any policies with regard to election mail" and that the USPS was "fully capable and committed to delivering the nation's election mail fully and on time".Mr DeJoy - a top Republican donor and former logistics executive appointed to lead the agency in May - acknowledged that the changes he had instigated had slowed some mail delivery, but insisted that it was "outrageous" to suggest they were intended to help President Trump in November.
