WASHINGTON—The Trump administration sought to blame Congress for the new policy of separating some families who arrive at the U.S. southern border, and it said only lawmakers could change that policy as part of a broader immigration overhaul, but Republicans and Democrats remained far apart on any deal.The debate is dimming prospects for GOP immigration legislation scheduled for House votes this week. Republicans and Democrats are digging in, and a bipartisan assortment of lawmakers are rebuffing the White House’s assertion that it has no choice but to separate families. “I think the White House can fix it if they want to—I don’t think there’s any question about that,” said         Sen. Orrin Hatch    (R., Utah).     But Homeland Security Secretary         Kirstjen Nielsen    told reporters from the White House briefing room Monday evening that the situation at the border was the “product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws,” and that Congress “alone can fix it.” She added: “Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law.”          The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults, which it described as “alleged adult parents,” at the border between mid-April and the end of May.                                         Congress has failed to pass bipartisan legislation on immigration partly because the issue mobilizes base voters. The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib explains.

House Republicans, buffeted by a weekend of criticism over the separation issue, had considered adding a provision to measures to address the family separations, but the White House’s aggressive posturing Monday could scuttle that plan. On Tuesday, GOP lawmakers are set to meet with President      Donald Trump,        and immigration bills will likely dominate the conversation.     In his tweets, Mr. Trump for days has been trying to lay the blame for an immigration failure on Democrats, which could drive away votes needed to push a bill through Congress.     “If the Democrats would sit down, instead of obstructing, we could have something done very quickly,” Mr. Trump said in remarks from the White House East Room. “We’re stuck with these horrible laws.”     Democrats have countered that they aren’t responsible for a policy adopted directly by the Trump administration—and that they are willing to take immediate action to end it by decoupling it from other issues.

Dianne Feinstein    (D., Calif.).     Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would create new temporary shelters to keep families together while asylum cases are pending, and other GOP senators were proposing similar measures.     “All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop. Now,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement.     Democratic leaders also deemed unacceptable the House GOP bills’ other provisions that aim to address the fate of Dreamers brought to the country illegally years ago, increase funding for border security and limit other immigration paths—and said such efforts would be dead on arrival in the Senate.          “It holds Dreamers and kids who have been separated from their parents hostage in order to cut legal immigration and enact the hard right’s immigration agenda,” Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) said in a statement about the more centrist GOP bill.     Criticism extends beyond the domestic debate. U.N. Secretary-General         António Guterres    said on Monday in a statement that “refugees and migrants should always be treated with respect and dignity, and in accordance with existing international law. Children must not be traumatized by being separated from their parents. Family unity must be preserved.”     Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, called on the U.S. on Monday to put an end to the practice.     “The thought that any state would seek to deter parents by inflicting such abuse on children is unconscionable. I call on the United States to immediately end the practice of forcible separation of these children,” Mr. al-Hussein said in his final speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council before his term in office ends.     Meantime,         Microsoft    entered the fray, saying it “is dismayed by the forcible separation of children from their families at the border.” The company added: “Family unification has been a fundamental tenet of American policy and law since the end of World War II.… We urge the administration to change its policy and Congress to pass legislation ensuring children are no longer separated from their families.”                                                  Children of detained migrants play soccer Monday at a newly-constructed tent encampment near the U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry in Tornillo, Texas.

Presidents         George W. Bush,    a Republican, and         Barack Obama,    a Democrat, adopted policies that generally allowed families who crossed the border seeking asylum to be released into the U.S. while their cases are pursued.     Rep. Kevin Yoder (R., Kan.), chairman of a House homeland security appropriations subcommittee, said he had called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to suspend the practice of separating children at the border as Congress works toward a legislative fix.     Other Republicans pledged their support for such a fix. “It’s time for this ugly and inhumane practice to end,” said         Fred Upton    (R., Mich.). “This week, the House should vote on a bill that would keep families together, give long-term stability to Dreamers, and improve our border security.”     Mr. Trump met with Sens.         Richard Shelby    (R., Ala.) and         Shelley Moore Capito    (R., W.Va.), who chairs a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that provides Homeland Security funding. Ms. Capito said after the meeting that they had “talked about our shared vision of strong border security, including technology, border agents and a wall.”     Democratic leadership aides said there had been no outreach from the Trump administration to lawmakers in the House or the Senate regarding immigration.

The children are being held in shelters across the country, including a tent in the desert near a border crossing in West Texas and a converted Walmart in South Texas. Ms. Nielsen said they are being treated well, but many reports detailed distraught children crying for their parents.     The emergency shelter in Tornillo, Texas, sits on a patch of desert inside a sprawling Customs and Border Protection facility at a small border crossing east of El Paso. The tented facility can barely be seen there. The area is surrounded by farm fields of alfalfa, pecans and other crops.     In nearby El Paso, immigration advocates, including those at the Border Network for Human Rights, were preparing for a protest Tuesday outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in that city.     —Siobhan Hughes and Alicia A.
