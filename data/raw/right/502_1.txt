                 | January 14, 2020 05:43 PM                Two Iowa field directors for Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign locked their Twitter accounts after a Project Veritas video showed a "top-tier organizer" saying "Milwaukee will burn" if the senator doesn't win the Democratic nomination.       Sanders organizer Kyle Jurek told undercover journalists that "there is a reason why Stalin had gulags," that Sanders wanted "free education" so that Trump supporters could be taught how to "not be a f---ing Nazi," and that he wants to "walk into that MSNBC studios, drag those motherf---ers out by their hair, and light them on fire in the streets."            Iowa state director Misty Rebik and Iowa co-field director Brooke Adams both locked their Twitter accounts after Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe claimed they hired or worked with Jurek, who deleted his Twitter account this afternoon.      O'Keefe published a Sept. 21 tweet of Adams celebrating with Jurek along with accompanying text that read: "This room is about to hit 20,000 phone calls!! Led by our top-tier organizers @hiranodanielle and Kyle Jurek!"      O'Keefe is a conservative activist who released tapes of ABC host Amy Robach claiming ABC quashed her report exposing Jeffrey Epstein in 2015.       Sanders, 78, has sparred with Sen. Elizabeth Warren over an internal memo his campaign circulated that painted Warren as only appealing to "affluent" voters. They will both appear Tuesday at the seventh Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, only weeks before the state's first-in-the-nation caucus.
