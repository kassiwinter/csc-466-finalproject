Republican legislators are weighing a health-care proposal aimed at winning over House conservatives that would allow states to opt out of some requirements in the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers and congressional staffers say.The proposal has the potential to be turned into legislation that would be part of a broader Republican effort to knock down key parts of the Obama-era health law. States would be allowed to obtain waivers from some federal insurance requirements that were opposed by the House Freedom Caucus, the bloc of conservative GOP lawmakers, according to a GOP staff member on Capitol Hill.      A White House official said Tuesday said that administration officials were participating in talks with legislators, and supportive of greater flexibility for states, but not promoting a particular or formal proposal. “This is being driven by the legislative side,” the official said.                Members of the Trump administration, including Vice President      Mike Pence,        have been meeting with groups of lawmakers and discussing whether there is a way forward for the party’s health-care bid.        
Related        States could get exemptions that require most insurers to offer specific health benefits such as maternity care or hospitalization. They may also get exemptions from a provision that bans insurers from charging higher premiums to people with health conditions.     But conservative lawmakers would have to decide whether that bid—some states could be allowed to preserve large parts of the Affordable Care Act—would be sufficient to fulfill the GOP campaign promise to repeal the law, as well as whether any viable alternatives remain.     The House Freedom Caucus was critical to the collapse last month of the Republican health bill intended as an overhaul of the ACA. Members of the conservative faction said that earlier bill, which was pulled from the House floor before a vote could be taken, didn’t do enough to bring down premium costs and wasn’t aggressive enough in its repeal of the ACA.     States can already apply to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for waivers that give them flexibility in how they implement the health law. But under the current law, states that pursue such waivers must still provide access to coverage that is at least as comprehensive and as affordable as under the ACA. The new proposal would give states more flexibility and latitude.     Talks have been under way about rekindling a repeal effort since the GOP on March 24 pulled the bill pushed by House Speaker         Paul Ryan    of Wisconsin. The White House has been talking to members of both parties.      President Donald Trump has repeatedly tweeted that the Affordable Care Act is dead while blaming the House Freedom Caucus for scuttling the GOP bill.     “Talks on repealing and replacing Obamacare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet Sunday.     House Republicans said Tuesday that the administration had been reaching out to the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group, a faction of centrist Republicans.     “Any time you’re talking, you’re moving in a good direction,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R., Idaho), a member of the Freedom Caucus.     Any legislation that revives the failed House GOP bill is still going to need more work before coming to the floor, Mr. Ryan said Tuesday. The White House declined to comment on reports of the new proposal.     Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a member of Senate Democratic leadership, said Tuesday that Mr. Trump and “House Republicans should know that if they try once again to give power back to the insurance companies, increase costs, and undermine care for people with pre-existing conditions, they’ll get the exact same result: a bill... that has absolutely no path to becoming law.”     Several factors are working against a resurrection of the Republican bill. There is little evidence the rifts have healed between the party’s conservatives and centrists. And Congress faces a crowded calendar, including plans to shortly dive into a tax overhaul.     The House’s last votes of the week are scheduled for Thursday, before lawmakers depart Washington for a two-week recess.     One Republican in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday suggested that lawmakers could return to the Capitol after the first week, and some advocated for working into recess, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But other Republicans counseled that they should take their time and not rush the negotiations.     “We’ll have a vote as soon as we have an agreement among the members that gets us to a majority,” said Rep. Luke Messer (R., Ind.), a member of House GOP leadership.      Mr. Messer said the administration was discussing with lawmakers the idea of letting states opt out of the ACA’s requirements that insurers cover certain “essential” health benefits, as well as the ACA’s “community rating” requirement that insurers provide coverage to people in a certain area without regard to their health status.     GOP aides emphasized that any proposed changes would need to be evaluated to see if they result in a net gain of votes for the bill. Centrists could balk at tweaks that please the more conservative members, the same dynamic that doomed the GOP’s initial bill.     Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican who represents a swing district in Colorado, said he wanted to study the effect of letting states opt out of some requirements.     “I would be very concerned if you allowed the purchase [of insurance] across state lines and then devolved those issues to states—I think that would be problematic,” he said.     —Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.
