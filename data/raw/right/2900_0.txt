Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was greeted with a bipartisan standing ovation when he entered the Senate chamber Tuesday.
McCain was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer.
He had been recovering from a separate surgery in Arizona, but made it a point to return to the Capitol to take part in today's crucial health care vote.

McCain was recognized by the presiding officer and gave a speech reflecting on the importance of the "world's greatest deliberative body."
McCain joked that the times he served as presiding officer are the "closest I'll ever be to a presidency."
He thanked his colleagues for their camaraderie over his 30 years in the Senate.
He also called for more civil discourse and debate, saying "to Hell with" the "loudmouths on the radio and television."
McCain also appeared to take a jab at President Trump, saying thoughtful deliberation is more important than "winning."

"Right now we aren't producing much for the American people," he said.
He called on the Senate to return to "regular order," where the body ignores arcane rules that allow bills to be passed with just a simple majority.
