WASHINGTON—In striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act this past week, the Supreme Court not only rejected a longstanding rationale for laws disfavoring gays and lesbians—the welfare of children. The court turned it on its head.Backers had justified the 1996 federal law as a way to ensure children didn't grow up thinking that gay relationships were equal to those of heterosexuals. The same was true for Proposition 8, the 2008 California initiative ending same-sex marriage that also fell with the Wednesday ruling by the high court.           More           As a testament to "moral disapproval of homosexuality," the Defense of Marriage Act could discourage "wavering children" from becoming gay themselves, the House report on the legislation said.     Likewise, because "the best situation for a child is to be raised by a married mother and father," Proposition 8 would stop public schools from teaching children "that gay marriage is OK," according to the proponents' official ballot statement.               House Republicans echoed that view at a news conference this past week to denounce the Supreme Court's ruling.     "The Supreme Court has ignored the needs of children," said Rep.         Randy Weber    (R., Texas).     "The desires of adults are not more important than the needs of children," added Rep.         Tim Walberg    (R., Mich.).     While such arguments seemed aimed at heterosexual parents who view homosexuality as a threat to their children, the Supreme Court on Wednesday looked to another group of children—those whose parents are gay.           Politics Counts                 By denying those families legitimacy, the Defense of Marriage Act "humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.     DOMA, as it is known, "makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives," Justice Kennedy wrote.     The harm went beyond humiliation, the court found. DOMA "raises the cost of health care for families by taxing health benefits provided by employers to their workers' same-sex spouses," Justice Kennedy wrote. "And it denies or reduces benefits allowed to families upon the loss of a spouse and parent, benefits that are an integral part of family security."     By focusing on the rights of children, who aren't responsible for their parents' identity, Justice Kennedy went beyond his prior rulings upholding gay rights. This time, his ruling was grounded in concrete harms as well as abstract notions of equality.     Same-sex marriage proponents previously have raised the benefits to children in state litigation. In 2009, for instance, the Iowa Supreme Court cited the interests of children of gay parents in holding that the state Constitution required recognition of same-sex marriage.     Some states have sought to head off similar rulings by amending their state constitutions to explicitly bar same-sex marriage. While Wednesday's Supreme Court decision left intact laws in 35 states that forbid gay marriages, Justice Kennedy has now made the interest of children a factor when weighing whether laws disfavoring gays violate the U.S. Constitution.     The Supreme Court previously has invalidated state laws that injured children as a way of expressing moral disapproval of their parents' behavior.     In the 1960s, the court began to strike down laws that denied rights to children of unmarried couples. Louisiana, for example, had barred such children from suing over the wrongful death of a parent.     A state court upheld that statute. "Denying illegitimate children the right to recover in such a case is actually based on morals and general welfare because it discourages bringing children into the world out of wedlock," it said.      The Supreme Court disagreed. "Why should the illegitimate child be denied rights merely because of his birth out of wedlock?" Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the court. "We conclude that it is invidious to discriminate against them when no action, conduct, or demeanor of theirs is possibly relevant."     Separately, same-sex marriages resumed in California on Friday afternoon following a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to lift the stay on the case after Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling.
