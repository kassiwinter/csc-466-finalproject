           President Donald Trump is vowing to veto the National Defense Authorization Act unless Congress repeals a section of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media platforms from liability for what users post on them.
His comments came in tweets posted Tuesday night. He wrote: "Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to 'Big Tech' (the only companies in America that have it - corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe & secure if we allow it to stand.
"Therefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk. Take back America NOW. Thank you!"
Fox News noted that opponents of Section 230 have argued that tech giants like Facebook and Twitter should no longer be shielded as a neutral platform when they operate as a publisher.
The issue surfaced again in October when Twitter blocked the accounts of users who tried to distribute a New York Post story about supposed influence peddling by Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and Facebook slowed the report's spread.            © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
