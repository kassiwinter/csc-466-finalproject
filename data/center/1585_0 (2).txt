WASHINGTON—Republicans clashed with President         Barack Obama    and among themselves when they assumed full control of Congress Tuesday, as the White House threatened to veto two top GOP legislative priorities and a messy leadership election highlighted opposition to House Speaker         John Boehner.    Mr. Boehner survived conservative challenges, winning a third term as speaker. But the acrimony marred the opening of the 114th Congress, a day otherwise marked by a flurry of ceremonial proceedings. White House officials said Mr. Obama is prepared to veto two bills GOP leaders plan to consider soon—one approving the Keystone XL pipeline and another changing the Affordable Care Act’s definition of a full-time worker from 30 to 40 hours a week—casting doubts over how much the president and GOP congressional leaders will be able to accomplish during the Democratic president’s final two years in office.     The veto threats resurrected two familiar policy conflicts between Republicans and the White House. Past tensions also resurfaced between the most conservative House Republicans and their leaders Tuesday when Mr. Boehner saw the most opposition in a speaker election since 1923, but survived to win support from a majority of those voting on Tuesday.                                                  Members of the House of Representatives at the opening session of the 114th Congress in Washington on Tuesday.          Associated Press                                                                                                             In the voting, 216 House Republicans supported him, while 24 voted for other Republicans, and one voted “present.” The number of defections was more than double two years ago, when nine House Republicans voted for other candidates, and the most since 1923, when Progressives agreed to vote for the Republican candidate only on the ninth round of voting.               Critics of Mr. Boehner, 65 years old, said the growing resistance to his leadership reflected frustration both on and off Capitol Hill with the legislative process in the House. Conservatives have criticized GOP leaders for hashing out too many deals behind closed doors and not giving lawmakers enough time to read legislation before voting, particularly the spending bill that passed late last year.     Rep.         Walter Jones Jr.    (R., N.C.) said the issue had generated the most phone calls his office has received since the October 2013 government shutdown, with many constituents urging him to vote against Mr. Boehner for the speaker’s position.     “I think the 25 of us who voted the way we did, we represented the frustration of the American people,” said Mr. Jones, who was one of 12 votes for Rep.         Daniel Webster    (R., Fla.). That was the most votes any one opposition candidate received.      With the departure last year of former Majority Leader         Eric Cantor    (R., Va.), there is no clear heir apparent or chief challenger to Mr. Boehner.        
Related        While the vote was a slight to Mr. Boehner, he enters the year fortified by an expanded House GOP majority and a new partner in         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.), who officially became the Senate Majority Leader.      “He led us through a period where we’ve increased our majority substantially,” Rep.         John Fleming    (R., La.) said of Mr. Boehner.     In November’s midterm election, House Republicans won 247 seats, their largest majority since the late 1920s. After the resignation of Rep.         Michael Grimm     (R., N.Y.), effective this week, Republicans control 246 seats, matching the Republican Party’s post-World War II record set in 1947.      GOP control of the Senate will encourage Mr. Boehner to modify his role in new ways to demonstrate that Republicans can successfully capitalize on their time leading both chambers of Congress. “It’s a great opportunity, but we can’t blow it. The American people are going to give us two years to try to get things done,” said Rep. Pat Tiberi, a fellow Ohio Republican.                                                  Speaker John Boehner gathers with fellow members of Congress to elect the speaker on the first day of their new session at the U.S. Capitol.          Reuters                                                                                                             Several GOP lawmakers who decided not to vote for Mr. Boehner said they saw consequences later. Rep.         Tim Huelskamp    (R., Kan.) said he learned shortly after he tweeted his plans not to support Mr. Boehner that he wouldn’t be appointed chair of a subcommittee he had hoped to lead. He declined to specify which panel. Mr. Boehner wasn’t involved in that decision, a GOP leadership aide said.     Two other House Republicans who didn’t vote for Mr. Boehner, Florida GOP Reps.         Richard Nugent    and Mr. Webster, were removed from the Rules Committee, an aide confirmed.                                                                                                                                                     Republicans have controlled just the House for the past four years, enabling Mr. Boehner to trumpet success by passing plenty of bills in the chamber with just a GOP majority, blaming Democrats for roadblocks in the Senate. Now, if Republicans want to put pressure on Mr. Obama to sign GOP policies into law, legislation will have to also pass the Senate, where Republicans’ 54-seat majority falls short of the 60 votes needed for most bills to clear procedural hurdles.     “He’s going to have to set expectations,” said Rep.         Bill Flores    (R., Texas), chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “We’ll get these things through the House like we have for the past four years, but the Senate is still going to [be a] struggle” at times, he said.     Conservatives in the House may not like the compromises needed to get at least six Senate Democrats on board. Rep.         Paul Gosar    (R., Ariz.) said he was worried GOP leaders had been too willing to immediately cut deals, rather than take a tough initial negotiating stance. “You don’t throw your low ball out at the very beginning. You go with what you want,” he said.      Mr. Boehner will work more closely with Mr. McConnell and the two chambers can always pass their own versions of bills, then negotiate a compromise, GOP aides said.      Even if GOP leaders successfully shepherd Republicans on both sides of the Capitol into legislative agreements, seeing those signed into law will depend on a relationship with the White House that began on a fractious note.     On Tuesday, the administration said Mr. Obama is prepared to veto any bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which GOP leaders have made their first order of business in the new session of Congress. The White House said it wanted a State Department review of the pipeline proposal to be completed first.     “This is simply another sign that President Obama is hopelessly out of touch and has no plans to listen to the American people or champion their priorities,” Mr. Boehner said in a written statement.     The White House also said it would veto a potential tweak to the health-care law that would change the law’s definition of a full-time worker from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week, expected to be considered in the House this week.     Mr. Obama congratulated the leaders Tuesday and, while acknowledging the differences, maintained a note of confidence about finding some consensus.     “I’m confident that there are going to be areas where we disagree and there will be some pitched battles,” the president said at the White House. “But I’m also confident that there [are] enormous areas of potential agreement that would deliver to the American people.”     —Siobhan Hughes and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
