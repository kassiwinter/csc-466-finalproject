         WASHINGTON—The House Oversight Committee on Friday renewed its request to the White House for documents related to the administration’s security-clearance processes, following reports that President Trump ordered his former chief of staff to grant his son-in-law a top-secret security clearance.     In a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the panel’s chairman,         Elijah Cummings    (D., Md.), said this was the committee’s last request for voluntary compliance, suggesting he could seek to compel the administration’s cooperation if the White House didn’t turn over the documents.      The New York Times reported Thursday that Mr. Trump had overruled concerns expressed by intelligence officials and former White House counsel         Don McGahn    and ordered former chief of staff         John Kelly    to grant         Jared Kushner    —his son-in-law and a senior adviser—a top-secret clearance. Mr. Kelly wrote an internal memo about the episode at the time, the Times reported.     Mr. Trump has denied involvement in Mr. Kushner’s or any other official’s security-clearance process. When Mr. Kushner received a top-secret clearance in May, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said that his client’s application had been “properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process.”         Ivanka Trump,    the president’s daughter and Mr. Kushner’s wife, said in an ABC News interview last month: “The president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband’s clearance, zero.”               The White House declined to comment on the report. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Lowell, said in a statement: “Whatever the accuracy or not of recent news stories, Mr. Lowell was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process. Again, officials affirmed at the time that the regular process occurred without any pressure.”     Mr. Cummings on Friday asked the White House if memos by Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGahn existed, Democrats serving on the committee said Friday on Twitter. “WH staff refused to confirm or deny—three times,” they wrote.     Mr. Cummings, in his letter, wrote: “If true, these reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation’s most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee.”     The Federal Bureau of Investigation is tasked with conducting background checks on White House officials before they are granted permanent clearances. To begin that process, officials must submit a form called SF-86 that lists, among other matters, all of their foreign contacts within a certain time period. Mr. Kushner initially omitted any contacts with foreign individuals from the form, and later updated it at least three times to include what he has said were more than 100 contacts with foreigners from more than 20 countries      Mr. Kushner in February 2018 saw his interim clearance downgraded from Top Secret/SCI-level to Secret, an administration official said at the time. The move limited the amount of classified information that could be accessed by Mr. Kushner, who has played a central role in crafting White House policy toward China, Mexico, Canada and the Middle East. His permanent security clearance was restored three months later.     Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
