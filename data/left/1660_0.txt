President Donald Trump finally committed to "an orderly transition" of power Thursday minutes after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's election win.The striking reversal came hours after a violent mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, and followed weeks of Trump and his allies fighting the election results."Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th," Trump said, according to a statement attributed to him and released by the White House.Trump was unable to release the statement himself after Twitter temporarily locked his accounts for "repeated and severe violations" of the company's civic integrity policy.District of Columbia National Guard stand outside the Capitol on Wednesday night after a day of rioting protesters.John Minchillo / APTrump has repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the election was stolen or that there was widespread fraud, for which there has been no evidence.Not long before the mob descended on the Capitol, Trump told protesters at a rally near the White House that "we're going to have to fight much harder."Even after the assault on the Capitol, Trump continued to push conspiracy theories about the election on social media. In a video posted to Twitter, he repeated unfounded claims that the election was taken from him and encouraged his supporters to disperse.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally, said after the riot that Biden was lawfully elected and that it was time to accept it."Count me out. Enough is enough," he said. "We've got to end it."Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called the riot a “failed insurrection” and underscored lawmakers’ duty to confirm the vote.
