Presumptive Republican presidential candidate         Jeb Bush,    working to shore up his bond with the conservative wing of his party, declared at a Christian university Saturday that “there is no more powerful or liberating influence on this earth than the Christian conscience in action.”The former Florida governor was the commencement speaker at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., the school founded by well-known evangelist         Jerry Falwell    that has become a frequent stop for presidential contenders seeking to show solidarity with the religious right. Mr. Bush’s delivery was animated but lacked the fiery rhetoric favored by some potential rivals for the GOP nomination. He didn’t mention gay marriage and alluded only briefly to abortion, saying, “Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love.”           Presidential Campaign           Mr. Bush also didn’t talk about his efforts as governor to save the life of a severely brain-damaged woman,         Terri Schiavo,    whose husband sought to remove her feeding tube over the objections of her parents. “That made him a hero to the right-to-life movement,” Mr. Falwell’s son and the university president, also named Jerry Falwell, said in his introduction.               Mr. Bush reserved his strongest language to condemn the birth control provision in President         Barack Obama’s    signature health care law, accusing the administration of “supporting the use of coercive federal power.” The Affordable Care Act requires many employers to offer contraceptives in their insurance plans. After an outcry from religious institutions, Mr. Obama supported an exemption allowing third-party insurers to cover birth control.     “What should be easy calls in favor of religious freedom have instead become an aggressive stance against it,” Mr. Bush, draped in a dark commencement gown, told the thousands of graduates and their families. “Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith.“                  “Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience—and in a free society, the answer is no.”                — Jeb Bush            He added: “Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience—and in a free society, the answer is no.”     Mr. Bush, who converted to his wife’s faith of Catholicism after he lost his first gubernatorial bid in 1994, has a long record of backing limits on abortion and opposing same-sex marriage. Still, some conservatives view him with skepticism, because he tends to focus on economic and foreign policy and because he supports legalizing undocumented immigrants, as well as the Common Core national academic standards.     The Planned Parenthood Action Fund criticized Mr. Bush after the speech, saying he signed laws as governor restricting abortion, expanding abstinence-only programs and intervening in the dispute over Ms. Schiavo.         Cecile Richards,    president of the abortion rights group, said Mr. Bush “showed a disturbing eagerness to insert the government into personal health care matters.”     The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Mr. Bush leading the GOP field but viewed less favorably than rivals among self-described conservatives. He was viewed favorably by 33% of conservatives and unfavorably by 28%, for a net favorable rating of five points. That compared with net favorable ratings ranging from 33 points to 23 points among conservatives for likely opponents Florida Sen.         Marco Rubio,    Wisconsin Gov.         Scott Walker,    Kentucky Sen.         Rand Paul    and Texas Sen.         Ted Cruz.         Mr. Cruz chose Liberty University to launch his presidential campaign in March. Other 2016 contenders aggressively pursuing religious voters include former Arkansas Gov.         Mike Huckabee,    a one-time Baptist preacher who announced his presidential bid earlier this week, and former Pennsylvania Sen.         Rick Santorum,    a staunch abortion opponent who is slated to reveal later this month whether he will run again for the Republican nomination.     In order to appear at Liberty University, Mr. Bush missed a forum Saturday attended by many of his likely Republican rivals in South Carolina, which will hold an early and influential presidential primary in February.     Two weeks ago, Messrs. Bush and Huckabee addressed the National Christian Hispanic Leadership Conference in Houston. Evangelicals make up a significant portion of the Republican voters in South Carolina and Iowa, which holds the leadoff nominating contest.     In his speech Saturday, Mr. Bush subtly plugged the name of his political committee, Right to Rise, which aims to position him as the candidate who will help the middle class and the poor achieve prosperity. “For all who would serve the poor and homeless, you set the standard with your belief that everyone matters, and that everyone has the right to rise,” Mr. Bush said Saturday.
