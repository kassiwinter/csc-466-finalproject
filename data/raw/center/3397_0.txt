Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesPresident Trump's new lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement Friday clarifying his earlier remarks on Fox News, noting that his "references to timing [regarding Trump's reimbursing Michael Cohen for his $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels] were not describing my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters."Why it matters: When Giuliani admitted that Trump personally repaid Cohen for the hush-money, he may have opened up other potential legal problems for the president. Trump said earlier on Friday that Giuliani is "a great guy," but he's still getting his "facts straight" about the payment: "He just started yesterday."
