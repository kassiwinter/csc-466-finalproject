 How bad do some House Republicans think the Senate bill is? Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette thinks the only way that number of Senate Republicans could have voted for the plan was if they were drunk: "I think our sense, at least in the House, was that a number of the Republicans that voted for it must have been drunk, because it really was a number that wasn't reflective of where we thought some of these people were going to be on a bill like this," he said after emerging from a House GOP caucus meeting. The CBO analyzed the bill, which passed 89-8, and found that the deal comes with a hefty price tag: The Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the Senate-passed package showed the bill adds more than $330 billion in net new spending, thanks to new refundable tax credits and new unemployment benefits. All told, the bill deepens deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade, with the vast majority of that coming in the form of extended tax cuts.
