           Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner is being asked to lay low following reports that he has come under FBI scrutiny in the investigation to determine if there was collusion with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, a source told NBC News on Monday.
Until the reports about Kushner’s involvement in the Russia probe, NBC reported President Donald Trump’s son-in-law had been given a main role in leading a new White House war room to specifically handle the Russia-related issues, but now officials are doubtful that he will take on this task However, Kushner remains focused on work and eager to help out with the investigation, sources say.
And, there is no sign that Trump has sidelined him, as the president told The New York Times, “Jared is doing a great job for the country. I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person."
The spotlight on Kushner grew brighter following a report in The Washington Post on Friday stating he talked about establishing a secure and secret communication channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a meeting in December. Also present at the meeting was Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is being investigated into whether he accepted money from foreign governments without the required approval.
Congressional Democrats have demanded to hear directly from Kushner about the allegations against him, CBS reported. Some also questioned whether his security clearance needs to be revoked.            © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
