President Donald Trump has signed off on a pardon for I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was convicted in 2007 of perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements.Trump has been considering a pardon for Libby for months, ABC News reported Thursday. Several conservative operatives and attorneys pressed Trump for the pardon, according to ABC. Libby was convicted in 2007 of lying to the FBI about his role in leaking the name of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison in the case, but President George W. Bush commuted his sentence. Bush declined issuing a pardon. Libby resigned from the White House in October 2005 after being indicted in the case. If the pardon goes through, it will be the second high-profile pardon Trump okayed. Maricopa Co. Sheriff Joe Arpaio was pardoned on Aug. 25, 2017, for a criminal contempt of court conviction.
