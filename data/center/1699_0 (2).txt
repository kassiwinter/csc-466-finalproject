The strongest stretch of job creation in two decades pushed the U.S. unemployment rate into the Federal Reserve’s target zone, keeping the central bank on track to raise interest rates as early as June and jolting investors worried about higher borrowing costs and slimmer corporate profits.U.S. payrolls grew by a seasonally adjusted 295,000 jobs in February, the Labor Department said Friday. That marked the 12th straight month the economy added more than 200,000 jobs, the best streak since 1995. The unemployment rate fell to 5.5%, the lowest level since May 2008. The latest improvement put the jobless rate at the top of the 5.2% to 5.5% range that many Fed policy makers consider to be full employment, or the rate the economy can sustain without stoking too much inflation. It sets the stage for central bankers, at their meeting this month, to drop an assurance they will be patient before lifting rates from near zero.                                          February's unemployment rate comes in at 5.5% down from January's 5.7%. WSJ's Josh Zumbrun and Spencer Jakab join Simon Constable on the News Hub with analysis of the jobs report.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 278.94 points, or 1.5%, to 17856.78. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.239%.                Meanwhile, the dollar surged in one of its best days in years, hitting an 11-year high against the euro and climbing against the yen. The greenback’s strength comes against the backdrop of a brightening domestic outlook and dimmer performance in the eurozone, Japan, China and other parts of the world.     “The breathtaking strength in job creation witnessed in recent months continues apace,” said Rick Rieder, co-head of Americas fixed income at BlackRock. “All signs point to the Fed beginning its normalization of rates” before the end of the summer.      The rapid hiring comes with caveats: Wage growth remains tepid. The share of Americans working is near the lowest level since the 1970s. And more previously unemployed Americans left the labor market in February than found jobs.     “There is a lot of slack left in the labor market,” said Megan Greene, chief economist at John Hancock Asset Management. “As long as you don’t have upward pressure on wages, you won’t have upward pressure on inflation.”     The report showed few signs of a pickup in wages, one of the biggest missing pieces of the economic expansion. Average hourly earnings among private-sector workers last month rose 2% from a year earlier, a slightly slower year-over-year advance than January’s annual gain of 2.2%. The figure is at odds with robust hiring, but matches with strong growth in low-paid restaurant and retail jobs.                                                                                                                                                     Columbus Castings, an Ohio steel foundry, hired 175 workers in recent months to meet increased demand for the railway equipment it produces. The firm’s chairman, Joseph Haviv, said it has been a challenge to find workers in the Columbus region, which has an unemployment rate below 4%. But wages aren’t rising, in part because the company has expanded its search for employees to include those with criminal records and those on extended spells of unemployment, who often can’t command strong wages.      “Our traditional process of hiring wasn’t working,” he said. “Our retention rate was very low.” The physically demanding foundry jobs, which start at $14 an hour, were unattractive for skilled workers. Mr. Haviv found inexperienced hires could do the job with some basic training. And by adding so many jobs at the bottom of the company’s pay scale, Columbus Castings’ average hourly wage has fallen this year.     Many economists, including some Fed policy makers, expect the tightening labor market to eventually deliver stronger pay gains and lift overall inflation.     “Wages are a lagging indicator of the business cycle,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said before Friday’s report. As the unemployment rate falls, “we’re going to see a labor market that’s much stronger, which will spur wage and price growth.”     The jobs figures showed Americans’ average workweek held steady at 34.6 hours for the fifth straight month. The number of hours worked is up slightly from a year ago.     The job market has averaged 275,000 new jobs each month over the past year, the most since March 2000.                                          How does the February jobs report relate to the broader U.S. economy? Joe Brusuelas, McGladrey Chief Economist, joins WSJ's Spencer Jakab and Simon Constable to discuss.

The U.S. economy approached a 5% annual-growth pace in the second and third quarters of 2014. But output slowed to a 2.2% advance in the final three months of the year. Many economists forecast growth to have eased further early in 2015, but hiring persists.     Icy weather in the Northeast and Midwest appeared to have had little effect on the numbers. The Labor Department said 328,000 workers were unable to get to their jobs because of bad weather in February. That is below the February average of 387,000 in the previous 10 years.     The broadly improving labor market has changed the type of job applicants seen by the Medical Weight Loss Clinic in Southfield, Mich. “People are changing jobs,” said Nick Welham, vice president at the chain of 33 clinics. He views that as a sign that workers have more leeway to look for the job they want.

Broadly speaking, Mr. Lacker said, the data show “the willingness of people to say ‘take this job and shove it’ and move on, to take a chance on a new position.”      Hiring was strong across most industries, but particularly so in lower-paying fields. The leisure and hospitality sector added 66,000 jobs last month and retailers added 32,000 positions to payrolls.      But better-paying professional and business-services firms added 51,000 jobs, despite a decline in temporary-help jobs, a typically low-paying category in the field.                                               If the February jobs report paints a rosy future for the U.S. economy, will it spur the Fed to lose 'patience?' Two strategists discuss how to make money if potential rate hikes drive the markets lower.

That could show factories are facing headwinds from global economic turmoil and a stronger dollar. The mining category, which includes oil-and-gas extraction and related services, fell by 9,300.     “The new jobs aren’t as good as the old jobs in terms of wages,” said Gary Chaison, an industrial-relations professor at Clark University in Massachusetts. “Manufacturing workers have become hamburger flippers.”     The irony? Wage gains have been strongest in the lowest-paying fields. The leisure and hospitality industry, with average earnings of $14.23 an hour, saw wages grow 3.2% from a year earlier in February. Retail wages advanced 2.8%. In contrast, manufacturing pay rose just 1.3%.     Those gains could support stronger consumer spending and cushion the economy from international risks. As well, a steep drop in oil prices has boosted consumers’ spending power despite modest wage gains.      Evette Rowe’s hourly wage has nearly doubled to $13 an hour since she took a job in 2011 at Atwater’s, a Maryland chain of bakery cafés. She started as a dishwasher, a minimum-wage job she took after two years of unemployment. Now she’s handling invoices for the company’s production kitchen, a similar role to the office-manager job she lost at nonprofit during the recession.     The additional income allowed her to purchase a used Oldsmobile and fix a leaky bathtub in her home. “I have a little more now,” the 42-year-old Baltimore resident said. “I can go to the hairdresser again and get that shirt I see in the window.”     —Michael S.
