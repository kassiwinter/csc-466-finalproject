  U.S. stocks were in a broad-based retreat Friday afternoon as a government shutdown loomed. Investors appeared resigned to the view that a budgetary standoff between President Trump and Senate Democrats over border wall funding will result in a government shutdown.Earlier this week, the U.S. House had passed a spending package that included $5 billion for Trump’s campaign-promised border wall. But in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed for passage of the spending bill, the measure appeared dead on arrival.Shortly after the opening bell Friday, shares rose as a durable goods report and a revision to the third-quarter gross domestic product -- both somewhat weaker than expected -- indicated that the Federal Reserve might have less reason to raise interest rates.
