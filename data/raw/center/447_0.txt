NORWOOD, Ohio—Long before Ted and         Linda Prues    planted a Mitt Romney sign in their front yard, they were Midwestern Democrats, and then some."I was a raging liberal, a real bra-burner," said Ms. Prues, 65 years old, the daughter of a local Teamster.Across the street, Bruce and         Laura Hobbs    took a similar journey, though in a different direction. "I didn't leave the Republican Party so much as it left me," said Mr. Hobbs, a 57-year-old self-employed computer consultant who has an Obama re-election sign near the driveway.           Swing NationThe Wall Street Journal is visiting three swing counties in swing states—Florida, Ohio and Colorado—periodically this year to gauge how the election campaign is unfolding.

But the decisions bring little hope. Many fear neither Mr. Romney nor President         Barack Obama    can end their worries over growing health-care costs, stagnating incomes and the feeble job market.     Norwood is in the heart of Hamilton County, a swing county in Ohio, a highly contested state where Mr. Romney has pulled nearly even with Mr. Obama in polls. The Wall Street Journal has followed voters in Hamilton this year, part of a series of articles from three contested counties in the U.S.     The postwar economy that buoyed America's middle class in this region has eroded, along with much of the common ground among middle-class voters. For decades, the Midwest's industrial economy helped Democrats and unions maintain loyalty in such middle-class towns as Norwood. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan drew many of these voters to the Republican Party.     Today, many residents are identified by pollsters as "persuadable" voters, a shrinking pool of people who in swing states decide national elections. After being torn from their traditional economic moorings and battered by the recent recession, they are searching for assurances, and their choice is up for grabs.                                          "I don't think (the candidates) know what the middle class is," says Patricia Walk, a laid-off secretary in Norwood. "What we need is some relief from this national debt."                                                                                                     "The parties want our votes, but they are not really speaking our language," said Norwood Mayor         Tom Williams,    a Democrat, whose town survived the closure of General Motors' Camaro plant 25 years ago.      The Prueses and Hobbses live on a street dotted with once-imposing houses and century-old trees. The homes overlook the spot where Floral Avenue once spilled into the main gate of the old GM plant. The sprawling property was taken over by health-service companies, a technical institute and a Sherwin-Williams paint store.     Even with such redevelopment, the town remains prey to the nation's common economic troubles: home foreclosures, lost jobs, health-insurance travails, shrunken savings and crimped city finances.                                         "Romney's campaign," says Lupe Hoyt, a social services director in Norwood. "I believe, will be much better for the middle-class family."                                                                                                     Like many voters, Hamilton County residents are conflicted. On one hand, they expect government to provide a basic safety net, to maintain quality public education and tame health-care costs. On the other, they bristle at the prospect of rising taxes and soaring government debt. Some listen skeptically to campaign messages promising a middle-class rescue, convinced the system benefits mostly the very rich and the very poor.     Sitting in a grand and drafty parlor of their imposing three-story, five-bedroom house, Romney supporters the Prueses laugh at their own circumstances. Their house, with 16 curved-glass windows and a spiked turret, belonged to an industrial baron who finished it in 1892. To save money on utilities, the Prueses confine their living space to the house's third floor, once the maid's quarters.                                         "I am liberal as far as things like equal rights, civil rights. But I'm a conservative when it comes to fiscal policy," says Norwood computer specialist Bruce Hobbs. "Right now, the middle is being better served by the Democrats."                                                                                                     The couple, both Norwood natives, lost most of their savings in 2007 from a soured real-estate investment. Mr. Prues then lost his job as vice president at a carpet company and struggled for years to find steady work.     These days, they live on rents from a building they own, even though many of their tenants are unemployed or receive government assistance.      "Are we middle class?" she asked, and then recounted how in past years the couple would take four or more vacations a year, many far from home. "I used to think so," she said, "but now I feel we're hanging by a thread." Vacations are among the luxuries the couple do without. She knows prices, down to the penny, of basic commodities: peanut butter, milk, bread and toilet paper.      Ms. Prues began to turn from the Democratic Party during the Reagan years, propelled largely by what she saw as a growing public dependence on government. "A lot changed when I became a landlord," she said.     Yet, despite the Romney sign, the Prueses said they don't feel fully at home in the Republican Party. Nor are they particularly taken by the GOP candidate.     "I worry the country is breaking into two groups," said Mr. Prues, his baritone gravelly after years of smoking. "There will be the elites and the poor, with the middle class squeezed and going by the wayside."          Few dispute that the middle class has taken a beating for decades, falling even faster since the financial crisis. The Pew Research Center reported recently that the share of total household income represented by middle-income families has fallen to its lowest level in at least 40 years. Polls show the proportion of Americans who identify as middle class has shrunk to below 50% while those seeing themselves as lower middle-class has risen. The median value of a middle-class family's total assets minus debt—now at around $93,000—is barely on par with what it was 30 years ago in constant dollars.     Declining prospects is one of many worries in the Hobbs household. Unlike several other families on the block, Ms. Hobbs kept her job as a corporate editor for an insurance company. Her husband continued to have steady work as a computer consultant.     The falling real estate market and local foreclosures have shaved at least a third off the value of their home. They worry about sinking more money into the house, prompting them to postpone repairs to the roof and exterior walls. Mr. Hobbs, for example, pointed out water damage on a wall in his den.                                         Middle-class voters in Ohio are split between the visions of the two presidential candidates. The latest WSJ/NBC poll shows Colorado virtually tied and President Obama holding a slight lead in Nevada.

The Hobbses, who back the president, fear they are falling below their parents' standards of living and that their 20-year-old son, Thomas, will slip further still. Their son, who took a few college courses before dropping out, lives at home and is uncertain whether more education is worth going into debt.     His parents share his doubts. "It's just not that clear right now that the cost of a college education is going to be worth what he can get from it once he graduates," Ms. Hobbs said.      The Hobbs family complains of being pummeled by TV ads and mailers from both presidential campaigns in the fall's pitched battle for Ohio. They fast-forward through TV ads by pretaping favorite shows. Fliers go directly into a recycling bin by the front door.                                                                                                                                                     Like her husband, Ms. Hobbs was a Republican. She served as a summer intern at the Republican National Committee during the 1976 presidential campaign and cast her first vote for President Gerald Ford.     She drifted left, though, as the GOP became more socially conservative. She hasn't voted for a Republican since siding with Bill Clinton in 1992.     When they look at Washington, the Hobbses see gridlock caused by hyperpartisanship. The night of the first Romney-Obama debate, they instead watched the Cincinnati Reds play the St. Louis Cardinals.     They are skeptical that either man can direct the economic forces that have altered their hometown. "What I see is a real hollowing out of the middle class, all because job stability just isn't there anymore," said Mr. Hobbs. "It's a stability that may never come back." He said he turned away from the Republican Party after President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq.                                                                                                                                                     Three houses away, 64-year-old Pat Walk also spoke of the changes that have swept Norwood. Her grandmother worked a few blocks away, at the American Playing Card Co., now gone. Her mother made labels at the U.S. Printing & Lithograph Co., also gone. Her father was a pipe fitter.     For 35 years, Ms. Walk worked as a secretary at the University of Cincinnati until she was let go in 2008. Since then she has scoured for work, scrapped her health insurance and tossed her cellphone. She splurged on a $130 teeth cleaning but is putting off fixing a cracked tooth.     She seethes over a political system skewed toward the rich, unions and the lower class. "I just have to laugh when I hear both parties say they will do things to help me get health insurance, when I know the only thing that will happen is that those who already have it will continue to get it," she said.          Outside the neat brick Tudor house she bought in 1978 and has since paid in full, Ms. Walk has her own Romney yard sign. She can't remember exactly when she stopped being a Democrat, she said: "Whenever I finally realized their walk didn't match their talk."     She isn't passionate about Mr. Romney. She ticks off all she likes about him: his family, his faith, his emphasis on enterprise and self-reliance. But she is critical of him for not spelling out his exact plans to rejuvenate the economy.     "I don't really believe he can create the sort of jobs he says he can create," Ms. Walk said.     Of all the residents on the 4500 block of Floral Avenue, likely none have come further than 60-year-old Lupe Gonzalez Hoyt, who lives with her husband, Robert, and her two daughters in an imposing Tudor manor across from the Hobbses.     Ms. Hoyt's father was a laborer who came to the U.S. from Mexico in the 1940s; her mother was a Navajo from New Mexico. She still keeps in her bedroom closet the brown saddle shoes she wore canvassing for George McGovern in her hometown of Los Angeles during the 1972 presidential campaign.     Ms. Hoyt directs Norwood's largest and oldest private social-service agency, the Norwood Service League, which provides food and other help to the needy. Many neighbors assume her politics lean liberal.     In fact, she has turned conservative after two decades of bristling over food stamps and other forms of government assistance. Now, she said, Mr. Obama was "taking the initiative and the personal responsibility out of everything."     The Hoyts have had their setbacks. Her husband, a tool-and-die maker, had his hours sharply reduced during the recession.      They clip coupons and buy used clothes at the Goodwill shop. For months, Ms. Hoyt put off repairing the back door, reserved for servants in a past era.      The choices by voters on Floral Avenue been made with limited faith in either candidate or party, they said.      "Money just evaporates," said Ms. Hoyt, who sits at her desk upstairs most days, tinkering with the family budget. The way things are going, she said, "my kids will be lucky to keep themselves in the lower end of the middle class."     At the other end of the block, Ms. Prues hopes for an economic recovery with a parochial view familiar to most families. The rental income that feeds her and husband increasingly arrives from unemployed tenants who receive federal-government housing subsidies.      "That makes me feel queasy," she said.
