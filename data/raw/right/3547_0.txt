President Trump held a press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May Friday morning from Chequers Court and didn't leave the lectern before a confrontation with CNN's Jim Acosta. During the questioning period with reporters, Acosta shouted at President Trump after he took a dig at the network and asked if he could get a question. "Mr. President since you attacked CNN can I ask you a question? Since you attacked CNN?" Acosta asked."No. No. John Roberts go ahead. CNN is fake news. I don't take questions from CNN," Trump said. "CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from CNN. John Roberts from Fox, lets go to a real network." Acosta responded by saying CNN is a real network too.President @realDonaldTrump: "@CNN is fake news.
