                                                                                                                                         A New Hampshire Senate debate moderator apologized to Republican candidate Scott Brown on Thursday for incorrectly disputing him on state geography.                                                                                                                                                      WMUR reporter James Pindell asked Mr. Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, what he thinks is going “right” and “wrong” in Sullivan County, which lies on the western border of New Hampshire, Fox News reported Friday.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Brown responded with a number of economic challenges that faced areas of the state north of Concord.                                                                                                                                                                    “Geography plays a role along the southern border. We have more jobs, we have more opportunity, infrastructure, and other opportunities up north are difficult,” Mr. Brown said. “One of the biggest opportunities is tourism. One of the biggest opportunities are ski areas and trails for snowmobiles — I support those efforts.”                                                                                                                              Mr. Pindell then interrupted Mr. Brown, reminding him that the question was about Sullivan county. “I think you were talking about the North Country,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                 But Mr. Brown responded “I’m talking about any place past Concord, actually, and the challenges of our state.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr. Brown went on to list more economic challenges facing northern counties when Mr. Pindell interrupted him again.                                                                                                                              “Sullivan County is west of Concord. It’s not north of Concord, Senator Brown. So what do you see as going well and what’s not going well there,” Mr. Pindell said.                                                                                                                              Mr. Brown stuck with his answer, maintaining that “the challenges are the same in every county in our state.”                                                                                                                   The state Democratic Party posted a video of the tiff, calling Mr. Brown “clueless” in the description online.                                                                                                                 Later that night, Mr. Pindell admitted that Mr. Brown’s geography was indeed correct in a tweet, noting that Mr. Brown was referring to Mt. Sunapee, a ski resort in Sullivan County north of Concord.                      Mr. Pindell also apologized on air after the debate.                      “I said that Sullivan County was west of Concord, not north of Concord. The truth is, it’s both. So on this point, Scott Brown was right, I was wrong, and I apologize to Scott Brown and to both campaigns,” Mr. Pindell said.
