           President Donald Trump Monday launched a Labor Day Twitter attack against AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka after the powerful labor leader Sunday said the nation's unions won't have "any choice" but to block the "unenforceable" United States-Mexico-Canada trading deal. "Just watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House," the president tweeted. "Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. We got robbed on Trade and everything else while his Dems just sat back and watched."
"NAFTA is the worst Trade Deal ever made ― terrible for labor ― and Richard let it stand," Trump added. "No wonder unions are losing so much. The workers will vote for me in 2020 (lowest unemployment, most jobs ever), and should stop paying exorbitant $Dues, not worth it!
Trumka told "Fox News Sunday" that the USMCA, as an "unenforceable trade agreement" would be a "windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers."
He also slammed the Trump administration for what he said were actions against American workers, after union voters helped Trump get elected, and said the president has taken on China in the "wrong way." "When he does something that’s good for workers, I say so," said Trumka. "When he does something that’s bad for workers, I say so. And I have to say, unfortunately, while he may not even know what his administration is doing, they’ve done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them.”           © 2022 Newsmax.
