WASHINGTON—The House Oversight Committee will conduct an investigation into         Ivanka Trump’s    use of a private email account to conduct official government business, the panel’s senior Democrat and likely next chairman said Tuesday.The statement from         Elijah Cummings    of Maryland came after a liberal ethics research group published copies of emails that Ms. Trump, President Trump’s daughter and a senior White House adviser, exchanged with officials at the Small Business Administration in 2017. “We need those documents to ensure that Ivanka Trump,         Jared Kushner,    and other officials are complying with federal records laws and there is a complete record of the activities of this Administration,” Mr. Cummings said in a statement.     Mr. Kushner is Ms. Trump’s husband and also works as a senior White House adviser.               Ms. Trump’s emails appear to violate guidelines governing official use of email, and American Oversight, the group that obtained the messages after filing an open-records lawsuit, called on Congress to investigate. The Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 midterms and are expected to initiate a wave of aggressive oversight investigations into the Trump administration.     “The president’s family is not above the law, and there are serious questions that Congress should immediately investigate,” said         Austin Evers,    executive director of American Oversight.     “President Trump and senior leaders in Congress have made it very clear that they view the use of personal email servers for government business to be a serious offense that demands investigation and even prosecution, and we expect the same standard will be applied in this case,” Mr. Evers added, referring to the Republicans’ long-running investigation of         Hillary Clinton’s    use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.      The White House Counsel’s office under President Trump clearly directed White House staff to use official email accounts for official business, and reminded staff of the requirements of federal records law.     In February 2017, the White House counsel sent a memo stating, in bold-faced, underlined text, “You are required to conduct all work-related communications on your official [Executive Office of the President] email account.”     The memo noted that federal records law requires that the administration take steps “to assure that the activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of the President’s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately documented and that such records are preserved and maintained.”     President Trump on Tuesday defended his daughter’s use of personal email for government business, saying there is no comparison with Mrs. Clinton’s email practices.     “There was no hiding, there was no deleting like Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Trump said before departing the White House for Thanksgiving. “Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails; she had a server in the basement. That’s the true story.”              Peter Mirijanian,    a spokesman for Ms. Trump’s personal attorney         Abbe Lowell,    said Ms. Trump’s use of a private email account was limited in purpose and emails were retained “in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.”     “While transitioning into government, until the White House provided her the same guidance they had to others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,” he said.
