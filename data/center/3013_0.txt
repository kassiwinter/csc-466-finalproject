With such a narrow window, consumer and other groups are seeking to pressure specific GOP senators they see as most likely to waver. They also assert that Republicans are trying to ram through a bill outside the normal process while reneging on a promise to preserve the ACA’s consumer protections, claims the bill’s sponsors reject. Timing is clearly a challenge for the bill’s supporters, who must cobble together votes by a Sept. 30 deadline, when a parliamentary vehicle that enables the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority expires. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said he plans to hold a vote next week on the bill by Sens.         Lindsey Graham    of South Carolina and         Bill Cassidy    of Louisiana.     But it also doesn’t leave much time for the bill’s opponents, who had weeks to build up resistance to previous ACA-repeal attempts, including legislation that failed in July to pass the Senate.                “This bill is complicated and far-reaching,” said         Larry Levitt,    a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Interest groups don’t have a lot of time to mobilize and figure out what it means.”                                         Republicans are scrambling to repeal and replace Obamacare with a new health care bill known as Graham-Cassidy. WSJ's Shelby Holliday breaks down the proposal.

They say it protects people with pre-existing conditions and returns control over health care to the states. They disagree with critics who say they have been secretive with the bill’s process, pointing out that they’re holding public hearings early next week on the legislation.     “Under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson, more people will have coverage and we protect those with pre-existing conditions,” Mr. Cassidy said Wednesday on CNN, referring to the other sponsors of the bill.     The attacks seek to hit the bill’s sponsors in areas of political vulnerability.     Save My Care, a health-care advocacy group, has launched ad campaigns in Nevada, Alaska, West Virginia, Maine, Tennessee and Arizona. An ad this week targets Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.) for co-sponsoring a bill that lets states waive ACA protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Nevada’s Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval opposes the legislation.     “We’re pulling out all the stops. We’re putting out a lot of phone calls,” said Brad Woodhouse, campaign director at Protect Our Care, an advocacy group focused on blocking the repeal. “Calls are going into Washington and state offices.”     The proposal would let states get waivers to end the ACA prohibition on insurers charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing health conditions. That was the situation before the ACA established the restriction.     A few months ago, Mr. Cassidy spoke out in favor of protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Mr. Cassidy has said the bill would protect these consumers because it stipulates that coverage must be affordable. Critics say that definition is so vague that rates for sick people still could become prohibitively expensive.        
Related        The bill is more far-reaching in some ways than earlier GOP repeal attempts. It would end the mandate that most people have coverage or pay a penalty and the requirement that many employers provide health insurance to workers.     The proposal essentially turns over federal ACA funding—estimated at more than $1 trillion through 2024—to states, allowing them to set up their own health-care systems. It would cut federal health funds to states by more than $4 trillion through 2036, according to a report Wednesday by Avalere Health, a health-care consulting firm.     States that expanded Medicaid under the ACA would see some of the largest cuts, according to the report.     With repeal possibly within Republicans’ grasp, a bipartisan group of 10 governors on Tuesday sent Mr. McConnell a letter saying they favored a bipartisan process instead of the repeal bill.     Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which the bill seeks to exclude from the federal Medicaid program, held a rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday, where senators and activists took turns speaking. The group has held rallies outside the offices of Sens.         Lisa Murkowski    (R., Alaska.) and         John McCain    (R., Ariz.), who are both undecided, as well as Sen.         Shelley Moore Capito    (R., W. Va.), who voiced concerns about previous repeal efforts.     Industry groups including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and America’s Health Insurance Plans, the major health insurers’ group, have come out against the proposal.     The repeal fight is likely to come down to a one-vote margin. If GOP leaders vote by Sept. 30, they will need 50 votes in the 100-member Senate, where they hold a 52-48 majority, with Vice President      Mike Pence        casting a potential tie-breaking vote. After Sept. 30, they would need 60 votes, which is unlikely given the unified Democratic opposition to GOP repeal efforts.     Sen.         Rand Paul    (R., Ky.) has said he will vote no, and Sen.         Susan Collins    (R., Maine) has signaled her serious reservations, meaning the bill’s sponsors cannot lose another vote.     Republican leaders maintain their bill presents the best chance GOP lawmakers have to deliver on a yearslong pledge to repeal the ACA.     “I’m giving you the chance to do something different than Obamacare because this is not working,” Mr. Graham said of his bill Wednesday. "It’s not working in Alaska, it’s not working in South Carolina.”     Corrections & Amplifications   A bill proposed by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to dismantle most of the Affordable Care Act would have cut federal health funding to states by $4 trillion through 2036, according to consulting firm Avalere Health. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the estimated cut would be $4 trillion by 2026. (Oct. 20, 2017)     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
