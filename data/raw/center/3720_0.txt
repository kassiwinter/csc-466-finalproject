WASHINGTON—On the eve of a critical Senate hearing that could decide the fate of Supreme Court nominee       Brett Kavanaugh,    a third woman came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s as partisan anger deepened on both sides.    The revelations shocked Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers are seeking to advance a nomination that legal scholars and lawmakers have said could cement a conservative majority.     Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial elevation, once expected to move smoothly through the Senate, now hangs on the votes of a handful of GOP senators who said they were troubled by the late-breaking claims. Sens.       Jeff Flake    of Arizona,       Susan Collins    of Maine and       Lisa Murkowski    of Alaska all said they would determine their votes after Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.    With a 51-49 advantage, Republicans can’t afford more than one defection, assuming no Democrat votes for him.    At the hearing, Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, are scheduled to testify separately about the alleged incident. The judge has denied Dr. Ford’s claims.        Committee aides also were seeking on Wednesday to speak with the judge’s latest accuser,       Julie Swetnick,    who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh was at a party in the early 1980s when she was gang-raped and that he tried to get women drunk at several gatherings. She wasn’t scheduled to appear at the hearing.        A second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, alleged in a New Yorker story published last Sunday that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party when they were both freshmen at Yale.    Mr. Kavanaugh has forcefully denied all of the allegations against him, saying at one point he felt like he was in the Twilight Zone. “This is crazy town—it’s a smear campaign,” Mr. Kavanaugh told committee aides.    Senate Judiciary Committee staff in a statement late Wednesday laid out the committee’s actions to investigate the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, including witnesses they had contacted to attempt to corroborate the claims. They also noted that since Dr. Ford made her allegations public, committee staffers have spoken to two men—one of whom has been interviewed twice and has submitted a written statement—who believe that they, not Judge Kavanaugh, committed the assault Dr. Ford described.    A spokesman for Dr. Ford’s lawyer didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.           During a news conference Wednesday, President Trump said the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are “all false to me,” but he left open the possibility that he could be persuaded otherwise after Thursday’s hearing.    “I’m going to see what happens tomorrow. I’m going to be watching,” Mr. Trump said. “Believe it or not I’m going to see what’s said. It’s possible that they will be convincing.”    Both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh released testimony they plan to deliver at Thursday’s hearing, giving a glimpse of the conflicting stories they intend to tell. Judge Kavanaugh addressed more directly than he has in the past the issue of his drinking in high school.    “I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today,” he intends to tell senators. “I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But…I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.”    Dr. Ford plans to deliver a detailed description of the alleged attack, when she has said Judge Kavanaugh, at a party, groped her and tried to take off her clothes. “I tried to yell for help,” her statement says. “When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most impact on my life.”           The accusations have emerged as a test of how Congress handles sexual-misconduct issues in the age of the “#Me Too” movement, which could influence the midterm elections. Republican lawmakers, concerned about the optics of their 11-man judiciary committee roster, hired a female outside counsel to do most of their questioning of Dr. Ford.    The committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday, and the full Senate could act on it early next week.    On Wednesday, Ms. Swetnick issued a sworn statement, made public in a tweet by attorney       Michael Avenatti,       alleging that between 1981 and 1982, she became aware of efforts by Judge Kavanaugh and his high-school friend, Mark Judge, to “ ‘spike’ the ‘punch’ ” at house parties she attended with drugs “and/or grain alcohol” and “target” women.    In a statement released by the White House on Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh called the allegations “ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.” Of Ms. Swetnick, he said: “I don’t know who this is and this never happened.” Mr. Judge’s lawyer denied the allegations.    Ms. Swetnick claimed she attended more than 10 house parties in the Washington area between 1981 and 1983 with Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge, and saw them “drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls” and grabbing them “without their consent.”    She said that in 1982, she was drugged and raped by a group of boys, and said Messrs. Kavanaugh and Judge were “present” when she was victimized. She said witnesses could verify her account and that she told people about the attack shortly after it happened.    She also said she had a “firm recollection” that at these house parties, boys lined up outside rooms “waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room,” and that those boys included Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge.    High-school friends of Judge Kavanaugh on Wednesday rebutted the new allegations of sexual misconduct. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than 60 people who said they knew the Supreme Court nominee in high school dismissed as “nonsense” accusations that he spiked drinks at parties so women could be assaulted. They said they didn’t know Ms. Swetnick.    Mr. Avenatti also represents Stephanie Clifford, the former adult-film star whom a lawyer for President Trump paid in October 2016 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Avenatti in recent days has repeatedly called for a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.    Hours after Mr. Avenatti tweeted the sworn declaration from Ms. Swetnick, Mr. Trump attacked him on Twitter, calling him a “third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh.”    Wednesday’s developments did little to shift the views of many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.              Sen. Lindsey Graham    (R., S.C) tweeted his skepticism about Ms. Swetnick’s claims. “I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to—according to the affidavit—ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it,” Mr. Graham wrote.           Sen. Chuck Schumer    of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter that it would be a “travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country” if the Republicans proceeded with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination without an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He called on the judge to withdraw.    On Tuesday, Judge Kavanaugh also was asked about two more claims of sexual misconduct, filed anonymously, during an interview with Judiciary Committee staff, according to a transcript released Wednesday. He denied both allegations. And Democrats said Wednesday that anonymous charges shouldn’t be measured the same as those made by women speaking publicly.    Ms. Swetnick graduated from Gaithersburg High School in 1980, according to a spokeswoman for Montgomery County Public Schools, which would mean she attended the parties described in her declaration after she had graduated. Judge Kavanaugh graduated from high school in 1983.    She has worked for two decades as a web developer, according to an online resume, including as a subcontractor for government agencies including units of the U.S. Treasury and State Departments.    Ms. Swetnick, who Mr. Avenatti said approached him about a month ago with her allegations, has little online presence. A registered voter in Washington, she isn’t affiliated with any political party. Federal Election Commission records show no donations by her to federal candidates. She has had a hunting license in Montana, according to public records, and was for years a resident of Bethesda, Md., where she listed a business in 2009 called International Building Solutions.    Public records reveal a handful of instances in which Ms. Swetnick filed complaints against others, or been the subject of them. Mr. Avenatti didn’t respond to a request for comment.    In 1993, she filed a criminal harassment complaint with state prosecutors in Maryland against a podiatrist and his wife, alleging repeated phone calls, according to court records, but the case was withdrawn two months after it was filed.    In 2001, Ms. Swetnick was the defendant in a domestic-violence case filed by Richard Venneccy in Miami-Dade County, Fla. The case was dismissed when both parties failed to appear in court in March of that year, according to court documents reviewed by the Journal.    Roughly a decade ago, Ms. Swetnick was involved in a dispute with her former employer, New York Life Insurance Co., over a sexual-harassment complaint she filed, according to people familiar with the matter. Representing her in the complaint was the firm run by Debra Katz, the lawyer currently representing Dr. Ford. The company ultimately reached a financial settlement with Ms. Swetnick, the people said.    A spokesman for New York Life confirmed that Ms. Swetnick worked there as an agent for less than two years, from 2006 to 2008. She didn’t list her work there on a résumé posted online.    A spokeswoman for Ms. Katz declined to comment.    Records show Ms. Swetnick also had recent run-ins with tax authorities. In 2015, Maryland’s comptroller filed a lien against her in Anne Arundel County, a suburb of Baltimore and Washington, for more than $30,000 in unpaid taxes. The state demanded about the same amount in interest and penalties for a total bill of $62,821. The state released the lien in 2016.    In 2017, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien on Ms. Swetnick’s Washington apartment for $40,303 in unpaid taxes, and released it in March, saying the tax bill had been paid.    Mr. Avenatti said in an interview late Tuesday that he had extensively vetted his client’s allegations.    “I’ll put my vetting process up against    Donald Trump’s       vetting process any day of the week,” he said.    —       Alex Leary,    Michael C.
