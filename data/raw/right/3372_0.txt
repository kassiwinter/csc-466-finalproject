                                                                                                                                         Fox News host Sean Hannity said his conversations with President Donald Trump’s lawyer were not significant enough to tell his superiors.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Hannity has come under fire after his name surfaced Monday afternoon as a client of Michael Cohen, who also represents the president.                                                                                                                                                      The disclosure was made in a New York courtroom after a federal judge ordered Mr. Cohen’s attorney to identify a client he initially refused to name.                                                                                                                                                                    Critics have questioned Mr. Hannity’s impartiality for railing against the FBI raid on Mr. Cohen’s office, hotel and home on his television and radio shows.                                                                                                                              But Mr. Hannity fires back at the end of his television show Monday saying he only had “brief, occasional” conversations with Mr. Cohen.                                                                                                                                                                 “My discussions with Micheal Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions,” Mr Hannity said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. Hannity said he only spoke to Mr. Cohen about real estate deals, adding the president’s lawyer never represented him or sent him an invoice.
