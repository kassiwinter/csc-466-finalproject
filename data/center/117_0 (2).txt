WASHINGTON—Democratic and Republican staff in Congress are drafting language for possible police-overhaul legislation that would limit the transfer of some military equipment to local departments, ban police use of chokeholds except in life-threatening situations and set federal standards for so-called no-knock warrants, according to people familiar with the talks.Final language on those measures that would be incorporated in a compromise bill between lawmakers from both sides hasn’t yet been set. And central issues concerning the prosecution and liability of individual police officers remain to be resolved, the people said. But they pointed to the new areas of agreement as a sign of momentum on an issue that both parties have expressed interest in addressing in the wake of         George Floyd’s    killing in Minneapolis police custody and other incidents that sparked nationwide protests and bipartisan calls for federal changes to police practices. President Biden has called on Congress to pass legislation in the coming weeks, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Floyd’s death on May 25.     The congressional effort is being led by Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.), who sponsored a GOP bill, and         Rep. Karen Bass    (D., Calif.), who sponsored a Democratic bill, as well as         Sen. Cory Booker    (D., N.J.). They, along with Sens Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) and Reps.         Josh Gottheimer    (D., N.J.),         Brian Fitzpatrick    (R., Pa.) and Pete Stauber (R., Minn.), are seeking to find compromise legislation that can pass both chambers.               The language now being discussed would prohibit the Defense Department from transferring to local police agencies equipment including firearms, bayonets, grenade launchers and some armored vehicles, one of the people involved in the negotiations said. Police departments around the country have had access to surplus military equipment, the use of which has drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the presence of heavily armed police officers exacerbates tensions during demonstrations.     It would also require officers who use no-knock warrants—which permit them to enter premises without notification to any inhabitants—to avoid destroying property in the process. It also would set a national ban on officers using chokeholds except as a last resort when their lives are in danger.                                                 Rep. Karen Bass, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Tim Scott are leading a bipartisan congressional effort on police-overhaul legislation.

The current statute requires them to show an officer willfully violated someone’s rights, a standard that some legal experts have said makes federal cases against officers challenging. Democrats want to lower it to “knowingly or recklessly.” Republicans don’t want it changed at all.     They also are discussing possible changes to the doctrine known as qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits and limits civilians’ ability to claim damages if their constitutional rights are found to have been violated by police.     Mr. Scott has proposed making it easier for people to sue police departments, but not individual officers, when they feel their rights have been violated. He said in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Booker and Ms. Bass have been receptive to the proposal. Spokespeople for Mr. Booker and Ms. Bass didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.     Last summer, a brief bipartisan effort among lawmakers to address police misconduct fell apart when Senate Democrats blocked a Republican bill they deemed inadequate and House Democrats were unable to bring up their House-passed legislation in the GOP-controlled Senate. On Wednesday, Mr. Scott said he was “reasonably optimistic” that the two sides could reach agreement on provisions for a bill.     The legislation would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate, in which both parties have 50 seats.     “I have a lot of confidence in Tim’s ability to negotiate this,” Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in an interview Friday. Mr. McConnell said he asked Mr. Scott, his party’s sole Black senator, to lead the GOP effort but added he wouldn’t speculate on the number of Republicans who would be brought on board without seeing final legislation.     One provision still unresolved is Democrats’ request to make it easier to prosecute officers for federal civil-rights violations under Section 242 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code called “Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law.” It is the Justice Department’s primary statute for prosecuting police misconduct. Mr. Scott said lowering the standard for such prosecutions is off the table.     Democrats seeking a way forward sought assistance from the Justice Department, which suggested to lawmakers that they leave the statute untouched but specify additional standards that department officials say could enhance federal prosecutors’ ability to bring cases against officers for alleged use of excessive force, sexual misconduct, theft or obstruction of justice.     The Justice Department’s suggestions would require prosecutors to prove an officer accused of excessive force acted “while knowing or consciously disregarding a substantial risk that their use of force is excessive,” according to language reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.     Mr. Scott said he hadn’t reviewed the Justice Department’s recommendations but reiterated that he wouldn’t support legislation that touched Section 242.
