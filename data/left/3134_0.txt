WASHINGTON — Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who is not seeking re-election, on Tuesday touted his $100 donation to Democrat Doug Jones — as a growing number of his fellow Republicans in Washington rally around Jones' embattled opponent.Jones is running against Republican Roy Moore in next week's special Senate election in Alabama. Multiple women have accused Moore of pursuing sexual relationships with them when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s and an assistant district attorney. One of his accusers said she was 14 when Moore initiated a sexual encounter.He denies the accusations."Country over Party," Flake wrote in a tweet that included an image of the check made out to Jones.Moore responded with a tweet of his own, asking for "100 grassroots conservatives to step up and reject the DC Establishment" by contributing to his campaign.Several top Republicans in Washington initially criticized Moore after the allegations first surfaced, but a growing number have softened their stance as polls show a close race. On Monday, Trump explicitly endorsed Moore and the Republican National Committee resumed its financial support for Moore's bid.More:Trump endorses Roy Moore for Alabama Senate seat; RNC resumes supportAmerica First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, also released anti-Jones ads and mailers this week.
