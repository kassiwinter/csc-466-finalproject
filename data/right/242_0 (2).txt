However, the news comes as weekly fatalities have declined to lows not seen since early on in the pandemic.The latest data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate a seven-day moving average of about 330 deaths, figures not seen since March 2020.

Figures also suggest a sweeping share of adults over 65 are protected against COVID-19, with over three-quarters fully vaccinated.UK EXTENDS COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS AS DELTA VARIANT SPREADS"We’re approaching a sad milestone, almost 600,000 lost lives because of COVID-19 in America," President Joe Biden said from NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier on Monday.
