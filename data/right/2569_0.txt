                                                                                                                                         Sen. Bernard Sanders on Sunday dismissed the presidential vote recount in Wisconsin, saying “nobody cares” about it and that it’s unlikely to affect the outcome of the election in any way.                                                                                                                                                      Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the Vermont independent and former presidential hopeful said the recount, while perfectly justified, simply is not a big deal.                                                                                                                                                      “It’s taking place. The Green Party has the legal right to do it … No one expects there to be profound change, but there’s nothing wrong with going through the process,” Mr. Sanders said, going on to throw cold water on any notion that the result in Wisconsin could change.                                                                                                                                                                    “This is exactly the issue — nobody cares,” he said. “I don’t think Hillary Clinton, who got 2 million more votes than [President-elect Donald] Trump in the popular election, thinks it’s going to transform the election. But do people have the legal right to do it? Yeah, we do.”                                                                                                                              Mr. Trump narrowly defeated Mrs. Clinton in the state, garnering 1404,000 votes to 1,381,823 for the former first lady, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission.                                                                                                                                                                 The recount has been spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who raised millions of dollars for the effort in just a few days. Over the weekend, the Clinton campaign said it would join the effort despite having no evidence of voter fraud or miscalculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Green Party also is pushing recounts in other battleground states.                                                                                                                              Mr. Trump dismissed the effort.                                                                                                                   “This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than 1 percent of the vote overall and wasn’t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,” the president-elect said in a statement.
