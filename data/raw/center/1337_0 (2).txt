FERGUSON, Mo.—Missouri's governor issued a local state of emergency and imposed a nighttime curfew Saturday after violent protesters looted local businesses earlier in the day.In a tense meeting at the Greater St. Mark Family Church in St. Louis, Gov.         Jay Nixon    said the overwhelming number of protesters have been peaceful. But the governor said he would not allow a small number of violent rioters to emerge again in the wake of a police-involved fatal shooting of 18-year-old         Michael Brown    one week ago. "If we are going to have justice, we must first have and maintain peace," said the governor, who was repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a quick indictment of the officer involved in the shooting.     The curfew will start at midnight and end at 5 a.m. local time.                State Highway Patrol Capt.         Ron Johnson,    who took over responsibility for security in Ferguson on Thursday, said he would enforce the curfew without resorting to tear gas or heavy-handed tactics.     There have been questions about who has full tactical control over police operating in the area. At Saturday's news conference, the governor indicated that Capt. Johnson is in full control of police at the scene. Capt. Johnson took responsibility for the actions of police Saturday including donning riot gear to confront protesters.     But even Capt. Johnson, who has been greeted warmly by protesters, was repeatedly interrupted by angry questions about the shooting itself. He said he wasn't in charge of the investigation but did say that 40 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had been deployed to the city on Saturday and were canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses to the initial incident.          Earlier Saturday, rioters smashed windows and looted local businesses in this city, while others, though only briefly, were able to step in and barricade broken storefronts to prevent further theft. Law-enforcement officials said Saturday afternoon that three officers were injured and one officer launched a single tear gas can after feeling trapped by rioters.     The violence came after authorities on Friday released new details in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Mr. Brown. Ferguson police identified six-year veteran         Darren Wilson    as the officer who shot and killed Mr. Brown.           More on Ferguson Unrest           Chief         Thomas Jackson    also released documents and surveillance video allegedly tying Mr. Brown to a robbery at a convenience store shortly before he crossed paths with police, upsetting the victim's family and many in the community.     The Ferguson police department had sought to release the video Thursday, but federal authorities argued against it, saying it could further anger the community, according to a law-enforcement official. Ferguson officials decided not to release it that day, but did on Friday, over the continued objection of federal officials.      The rioting erupted after Thursday night's and Friday's peaceful protests that had followed Gov. Nixon's appointment of state highway patrol led by Capt. Johnson to oversee security and the subsequent relaxation of the previous heavy police presence and tactics. Mr. Johnson grew up in the area.     Some protesters expressed frustration with the violence that could undermine their quest for justice for Mr. Brown and a peaceful resolution of the tension between the nearly all-white Ferguson police force and the largely black community.                                          Protests in Ferguson, Missouri turned violent again as rioting and looting broke out early Saturday morning.

But the police eventually pulled back from the scene to avoid a broader confrontation with the protesters and looters. "There was a decision made to pull our people out of there for fear for our safety and the protesters'," Sgt. Al Nothum, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said Saturday morning. "If there was a confrontation, people were going to be seriously injured," he added.      Many of the protesters and looters wore bandannas over their faces and chanted: "No justice, no peace." Police officers formed themselves into a line, and one demanded through a megaphone: "You must clear the roadway or face arrest." Those protesters eventually backed away from the police line.     Officers wore what are known as battle-dress uniforms, or BDUs, as they stood in line. Some wore dark blue fatigues, which is a more traditional SWAT-style uniform, while others had military-style camouflage. The varying uniforms made it difficult to ascertain which department the officers were representing.      Separately, men who said they were members of a group calling itself the New Black Panther Party worked to push protesters back and maintain order, while some of the more vocal protesters cursed the police. Some protesters ran around the side of a nearby building to grab pre-made Molotov cocktails, though none was lighted or thrown.                                                  Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and curfew in response to looting the previous night in Ferguson.          Reuters                                                                                                             Not long after that, the looting began. Young men with partially-covered faces kicked in the front door of a liquor store and began looting bottles. Protesters said that store—Ferguson Market and Liquor—was the one from which Mr. Brown allegedly stole cigars and allegedly assaulted the store owner.     The glass door of a beauty-supply store was also kicked in, but other men quickly stood guard to prevent looters from going in. "We don't loot. We're just standing up for what we believe in," said a man in front of the store, who declined to give his name.      "It's not serving the purpose," said         James Bryant,    a 31-year-old from St. Louis, as he watched a young man rummage through a mobile-phone store after smashing a glass door. "The cause was to prevent police brutality."     Meanwhile, not far away, police slowly advanced in a line toward the crowds, but stopped short of engaging them, as the looting there had begun to subside. Looters and protesters had briefly scattered, driving their cars down side streets and voicing concerns about the safety of their vehicles if the police advanced further.                                          The Ferguson, Mo. Police Department released surveillance video that they say shows Michael Brown and a friend robbing a convenience store on August 9, the same day Brown was fatally shot by a police officer.

Looters pushed into the shop.         Jarris Williams    tried unsuccessfully to keep the looters away, before giving up. As they poured into the liquor store, the 19-year-old bent down on one knee and began to cry, as he watched the destruction and theft.      "It's not about personal gain. We wanted to make it look different," he said. "They took pictures of 'hands up, don't shoot,'" he said, referring to media documenting the nonviolent mantra that many protesters have adopted over the past week. "Now that's all negated."     During the final hours of darkness on Saturday morning, looters in some half-dozen stores along the street were carting out armsful of goods. Most of the people who had been protecting the shops had by then left their posts. It wasn't clear why.      Police then left the scene and the looting continued apace.                                                  Mourners pray on Saturday at the site where Michael Brown was killed on Canfield Drive in Ferguson, Missouri.          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             Sometime after 5 a.m. Saturday, men who appeared to be owners of the businesses started arriving and standing in front of the looted stores to protect them. One man who arrived at Ferguson Market and Liquor had what appeared to be a pistol in his waistband, though with about an hour to go before sunrise, it appeared he hadn't used the weapon.      After daybreak on Saturday, rain poured down on Ferguson, as police vehicles swarmed into town. Officers in bright yellow jackets took up positions in front of looted businesses, encountering no resistance.     Shop owners and members of the community were out by midmorning with brooms and shovels helping to clean up the mess made by looters.              L.J. Minner,    a 10-year-old boy who plays linebacker and running back had football practice canceled on Saturday, so he was recruited by his father         Larry Minner    to walk through Ferguson, pitching in and cleaning up, carrying a pushbroom as tall as himself. His father led the way into stores to ask if anyone needed help in the cleanup. "I just want people to know there's good people in this community," said Mr. Minner, 48, who lives in Ferguson. "You need to be a pillar of the community."     Still, Mr. Minner said he was upset the police didn't respond overnight to reports of looting, saying he understood the police wanted to interact well with protesters, but he noted shopkeepers have the same rights. "If you've got individuals who are taxpayers, you've got to respond," he said.     Mr. Minner said he understood the police were bound to get criticism no matter what they do. "The police are in a Catch-22 situation," he said, having to negotiate a delicate calculation of how and when to respond to a complex situation like a riot. "But that's the cost of the badge."      Inside the first store Mr. Minner and his son visited, Sam's Meat Market, 43-year-old         Mark Jacob    surveyed the damage in his family-owned shop, the second time the shop has been looted this week.     "I called the police four or five times, I called since 12 o'clock!" he said, expressing frustration. "I called Ferguson and they said, 'We don't have anything to do with it.' I called St. Louis County and they said 'We don't have anything to do with it.' I called the state police, and they say, 'You have to call Ferguson.' It's like a circle!"        But Highway Patrol Sgt. Nothum said he wasn't aware that police weren't responding to calls for help and that callers weren't being put through to the appropriate department. He said he was aware of the frustration people like Mr. Jacob feel if they have encountered such a circular situation.     Mr. Jacob said he saw the looting on TV and yet couldn't get the police to respond. At 3 a.m., when he came to the store to take care of things himself he said he found two men roaming around the abandoned store who left when he came in. He showed a pile of ashes in the corner of the store where looters tried, unsuccessfully, to start a fire in the shop.     "We still didn't hear from the insurance," he said, unsure if looting is covered by the store's policy. "Even if it is, this is the second time." He said both times he's had to borrow liquor from other shopkeepers, which has put him in debt. "I am behind," he added.
