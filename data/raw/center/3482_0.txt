Mr. Cohen’s attorneys are reviewing more than 3.7 million documents federal prosecutors seized in an April raid of Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room to designate which communications they see as protected by attorney-client privilege, ahead of a Friday deadline set by Judge         Kimba Wood    of the Southern District of New York.               Stephen Ryan,         Todd Harrison    and others at the firm McDermott, Will & Emery LLP, which has been representing Mr. Cohen since June 2017, will cease doing so after that review is complete, the person said.                                          President Donald Trump said in early May that his lawyer Michael Cohen was reimbursed for a payment Mr. Cohen made to former adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Here are some of the responses by Mr. Trump and the White House to the allegations over the past few months.

Mr. Cohen wants to hire a lawyer with close ties to the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, the people said.               Mr. Cohen hasn’t yet decided whether he will cooperate with prosecutors in the case, according to one of those people. He hasn’t been charged with any crime.      Lawyers for Mr. Cohen didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Cohen also didn’t respond to a request for comment.     Judge Wood has appointed a special master to oversee the document review and decide whether communications designated as privileged by Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization can be seen by government investigators.     The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office is investigating whether Mr. Cohen committed bank fraud, campaign-finance violations and other possible crimes. A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment. Mr. Cohen has denied any wrongdoing.     The law firm’s expected withdrawal was first reported by ABC News.     —Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.
