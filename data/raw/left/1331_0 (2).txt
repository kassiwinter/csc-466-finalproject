   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said on Sunday that while the disease is scary, “the plain truth is, we can stop Ebola. We know how to control it.”
His comments on ABC’s “This Week” came the day after an American doctor who was stricken with the disease while working in Liberia was flown into the United States and transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.
“Ebola’s scary, and it’s understandable that with a deadly disease, people are concerned,” Frieden said.

The key to stopping its spread, he said, is identifying the source of the disease in West Africa and stopping it there, and the CDC will put 50 staff members on the ground there over the next 30 days.
An Ebola vaccine “would be very helpful,” he said, but it won’t exist anytime soon. Still, he added, health workers can find and isolate patients, trace the contacts they’ve made and encourage safe burial practices for those who fall ill.
“We’re not going to hermetically seal the borders of the U.S. We’re reliant and interdependent with the world for travel, for trade, for the economy, for our families and communities,” Frieden said. “The single most important thing we can do to protect Americans is to stop this disease at the source in Africa.”
