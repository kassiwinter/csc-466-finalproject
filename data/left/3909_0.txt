                                          1.19am GMT                        01:19                                            Summary               The week has come to a close with a number of major developments in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. We’re ending our live coverage for the day – thanks for following along. Here’s what you need to know about the day’s news:   Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer and legal fixer, spoke with a Russian offering help from Moscow during the 2016 campaign, according to Mueller.  Cohen told investigators he made efforts to contact the Russian government to propose a meeting between Trump and Putin in 2015, after discussing this with Trump.  Prosecutors recommended Cohen receive a prison sentence of about four years.  The government for the first time implicated the president in Cohen’s campaign finance violations, saying the attorney “acted in coordination with and at the direction” of Trump.  Paul Manafort lied to the FBI and to the special counsel’s office, according to a separate filing by Mueller on Friday.  The former campaign chairman tried to conceal his contact with an “administration official” inside the White House as late as May 2018, the filing said.  Mueller wrote: “Manafort told multiple discernible lies – these were not instances of mere memory lapses.”  James Comey, the former FBI director, testified before the House judiciary and oversight committees on Friday, and later criticized the process.  Trump tweeted attacks on Comey and also wrongly claimed the sentencing memo “clears the president”.  John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has been interviewed by Mueller’s team and is expected to quit, CNN reported.  George Papadopoulos, former aide to Trump’s campaign, was released from prison on Friday after serving 12 days for lying to the federal government about his contacts with the Russians.  Trump nominated William Barr as the next attorney general, selecting a man who served in the role under George HW Bush.

They came up empty today but will try again. In the long run, it'll make no difference because facts are stubborn things.

Democrats, however, have criticized the investigation. Via AP:               “He answered the questions he had to answer,” said Rep Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. But he added that he was left with the impression that “we got nowhere today”.  Florida Rep Ted Deutsch said the Republican majority “wishes to only ask questions still about Hillary Clinton’s emails, all to distract from the big news today, which is what’s happening in court”.    Congressman Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel, said he would end the investigation when Democrats take over in January.

On Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman accused of lying “in multiple ways and on multiple occasions”, Sanders sought to distance the claims from Trump:            The government’s filing in Mr Manafort’s case says absolutely nothing about the president. It says even less about collusion and is devoted almost entirely to lobbying-related issues. Once again the media is trying to create a story where there isn’t one.”   Sanders meanwhile attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, who is potentially facing four years in prison:            The government’s filings in Mr Cohen’s case tell us nothing of value that wasn’t already known. Mr Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr Cohen is no hero.”   The Cohen filings directly implicate Trump. Cohen, who was Trump’s legal fixer, told investigators he made efforts to contact the Russian government to propose a meeting between Trump and Putin in New York in September 2015, after discussing this with Trump.

Here are the details. https://t.co/zGUMI35K65   December 7, 2018   This filing marks the first time that federal prosecutors have directly implicated Trump in the violations. That could mean serious consequences. Here’s how Lawrence Noble, the former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission, explained it to the Post:              There is little question Cohen, the campaign and the candidate are liable for the campaign finance violations...  In this case, you’re dealing with a situation where his lawyer who actually admits to doing the transactions says that they broke the law and that Trump knew about it.”    Noble further said, “This is something that very clearly would have to be considered for criminal prosecution” of Trump – were he not president. The Post noted that DOJ guidelines suggest that a sitting president can’t be indicted. More from the anaylsis:            In order for Trump to be charged – if he weren’t president – it would need to be a ‘knowing and willful violation,’ Noble said. This doesn’t mean, though, that Trump would need to know the specific statutes that his actions were violating. It would be enough for Trump to know that campaign contributions needed to be reported and were subject to limits, which he clearly did, and that the payments were being made in order to influence the election.

In sum, Manafort sat for 12 meetings with special counsel, including three prior to the plea agreement, Mueller said. He has testified twice before a federal grand jury.  Mueller submitted the document to explain why a cooperation agreement with Manafort reached in September had fallen apart. Manafort denies lying to Mueller, but both sides have requested that the court not delay sentencing Manafort on multiple fraud convictions.

The defendant breached his plea agreement in numerous ways by lying to the FBI and Special Counsel’s Office. The principal lies relate to, among other things: (1) Manafort’s interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik; (2) Kilimnik’s participation in count two of the superseding information; (3) a wire-transfer to a firm that was working for Manafort; (4) information pertinent to another Department of Justice investigation; and (5) Manafort’s contact with Administration officials...  Manafort told multiple discernible lies – these were not instances of mere memory lapses. If the defendant contends the government has not acted in good faith, the government is available to prove the false statements at a hearing.”    
Here’s our previous reporting on Kilimnik, a Russian man who is said to have ties to Moscow’s intelligence services. He has already been charged by Mueller with witness tampering:                                        11.13pm GMT                        23:13                                              Here is the president’s tweet shortly after the release of sentencing memos for his former personal attorney:     Donald J. Trump  (@realDonaldTrump)  Totally clears the President. Thank you!   December 7, 2018   The memos do not “clear” the president. On the contrary, prosecutors in New York wrote of Michael Cohen’s “illegal campaign contributions”:            With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments... In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1 [Trump].      Brad Heath  (@bradheath)  This is new. Federal prosecutors have said for the first time in a court filing that Cohen committed campaign finance crimes "in coordination with and at the direction of" President Trump. pic.twitter.com/mOYvdMqHS7   December 7, 2018                                         10.52pm GMT                        22:52                                              Trump is now tweeting about James Comey – and has not yet commented on the newly released sentencing memos about his former personal attorney. Comey was on Capitol Hill today to privately testify before the House judiciary and oversight committees.     Donald J. Trump  (@realDonaldTrump)  It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration. Force him to answer the questions under oath!   December 7, 2018   Officials are expected to release a transcript of the session. Comey told reporters after the session that he is going to return for a follow-up:     The Lead CNN  (@TheLeadCNN)  "After a full day of questioning, two things are clear to me. One, we could have done this in open setting, and two, when you read the transcript you will see that we're talking again about Hillary Clinton's e-mails for heaven's sakes," says ex-FBI director @Comey on Capitol Hill pic.twitter.com/uN5ZAHFOIT   December 7, 2018   The fired FBI director said:             When you read the transcript, you will see that we were talking again about Hillary Clinton’s emails for heaven’s sakes, so I’m not sure we need to do this at all. But I’m trying to respect the institution and answer questions in a respectful way.                                        10.41pm GMT                        22:41                                              One critical detail from the latest Mueller filing is the claim that in November 2015, Cohen spoke with a Russian national “who claimed to be a ‘trusted person’ in the Russian Federation” and offered the Trump campaign “political synergy” and “synergy on a government level”.    Philip Rucker  (@PhilipRucker)  Mueller filing says a Russian national claiming to be a "trusted person" in the Russian Federation contacted Cohen in Nov. 2015 offering the Trump campaign "political synergy" and "synergy on a government level" pic.twitter.com/2ZV8FAPMlw   December 7, 2018   From my colleague Jon Swaine:              The Russian repeatedly proposed a meeting between Trump and Putin, according to Mueller, and told Cohen that the meeting “could have a ‘phenomenal’ impact ‘not only in political but in a business dimension as well’” because there was “no bigger warranty in any project than consent of Putin”.  Mueller said Cohen chose not to pursue the offer of assistance in part because he was working on the project with someone else he “understood to have his own connections to the Russian government”, a likely reference to Felix Sater, a controversial developer who was working on the Trump Tower Moscow plans.            Updated       at 10.48pm GMT                                         10.34pm GMT                        22:34                                            Cohen sentencing memo: key quotes               Some key quotes from the Cohen sentencing memo, filed by federal prosecutors in New York:   “But the crimes committed by Cohen were more serious than his submission allows and were marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life (and was evidently hidden from the friends and family members who wrote on his behalf).”  “He was motivated ... by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends. Now he seeks extraordinary leniency – a sentence of no jail time – based principally on his rose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes; his claims to a sympathetic personal history; and his provision of certain information to law enforcement.”  “While Cohen – as his own submission makes clear – already enjoyed a privileged life, his desire for even greater wealth and influence precipitated an extensive course of criminal conduct.”  “While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows. He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1 [Trump].”  “Cohen clouded a process that Congress has painstakingly sought to keep transparent. The sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen’s brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful.”  “Cohen’s submission suggests that this was but a brief error in judgment. Not so. Cohen knew exactly where the line was, and he chose deliberately and repeatedly to cross it.”  “After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen’s decision to plead guilty – rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes – does not make him a hero.”  More details here:           Updated       at 10.43pm GMT
