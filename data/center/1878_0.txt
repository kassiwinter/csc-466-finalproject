A reverend who was a high school track coach. A quiet and industrious recent college graduate. An up-and-coming minister who looked forward to leading her congregants. They were among the nine people gunned down by a lone shooter during a Wednesday night Bible study meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. The victims—six women and three men—ranged in age from 26 to 87. They were pursuing various paths in their lives, but they were drawn together by their faith. Most were religious leaders at the church, including 41-year-old pastor         Clementa Pinckney,    and parishioners, said friends.              DePayne Middleton,    49 years old, was set to be admitted as a minister at Emanuel AME, where she already had been performing those duties, said her uncle, Walter Middleton.                A South Carolina native, Ms. Middleton also was raising four daughters—one recently had graduated high school, he said.           Late Wednesday night, the family grew alarmed when they couldn’t reach Ms. Middleton, her uncle said. Soon, another member of the church called them with tragic news.      “She was killed instantly,” Mr. Middleton said.      Another victim,         Tywanza Sanders,    recently graduated from Allen University in Columbia, S.C., with a business degree and worked at a barbershop, where he was known for his skill with the clippers.     When Mr. Sanders, 26, wasn’t working, he usually could be found at Emanuel AME, studying the Bible with a tight-knit community that was more like a family, said friends.     What they say they will miss most is his broad smile and positive outlook on life.

Victim Sharonda Singleton, a 45-year-old mother of three, was a high school track coach and speech-language pathologist at Goose Creek High School.      She also was a reverend at Emanuel AME, according to its website.      “She was an amazing woman,” said the victim’s sister, Shalisa Coleman.     Goose Creek High School planned to host a vigil Thursday night.         Ms. Singleton    “cared about her students and was an advocate for them, always willing to listen to and talk with them,” said principal         Jimmy Huskey.                                             Colleagues say Clementa Pinckney, a state senator and pastor of the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., ministered to the poor and backed legislation aimed at improving their lives. He was one of nine killed in a shooting rampage on Wednesday.

Sh’Kur Francis, a 21-year-old Baptist minister, said he met Mr. Simmons when he was a boy and continued to see the pastor at many of his family’s gatherings.      “He had a very good sense of humor,”         Mr. Francis    said. “He was a wonderful person.”     On Thursday, a Charleston County, S.C., official said the city would name a library after another victim,         Cynthia Hurd.         Ms. Hurd, 54, worked for 31 years for the Charleston County Public Library.      “Cynthia was a tireless servant of the community who spent her life helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth,” the library said in a statement. “We ask for prayers for her family, her co-workers, her church and this entire community as we come together to face this tragic loss.”     The alleged hate-crime shooting by suspect Dylann Roof also claimed the lives of:         Ethel Lance,    70; Susie Jackson, 87; and Myra Thompson, 59.

Ms. Wooten said she would perform autopsies in coming days, but doesn’t expect them to provide any new information.      The shooting comes eight years almost to the day of the death of nine firefighters who were battling a furniture store blaze, an incident Ms. Wooten said she couldn’t help remembering when she got the call informing her about the nine people killed Wednesday.      “We’re human, too,” she said. “We’re touched by the terror of such an event.”     —Dan Frosch and Elana Zak       contributed to this article.
