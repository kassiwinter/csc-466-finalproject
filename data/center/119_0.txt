                                                  This frame grab from the Saudi-owned television network MBC shows Suleiman Abu Ghaith.          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                                                  Updated March 8, 2013 2:41 pm ET                 The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, on Friday added his voice to those criticizing the Obama administration's decision to bring former al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith to New York for trial in federal court.     In a written statement, Mr. McConnell said Mr. Abu Ghaith, a son in law of          Osama bin Laden    , should have been placed in military custody at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "At Guantanamo, he could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers," Mr. McConnell.      Three other Republican senators—John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and         Kelly Ayotte     of New Hampshire—also objected to the administration's decision Thursday and elaborated in a statement Friday. "A foreign member of al Qaeda should never be treated like a common criminal and should never hear the words 'you have a right to remain silent,' " the statement said.     Another Republican, Rep.          Peter King     of New York, said he didn't have a problem with a civilian trial because the videotapes of Mr. Abu Ghaith delivering al Qaeda propaganda and other public evidence would be enough to convict him without the need to use sensitive intelligence.          The WSJ reported this morning on the debate about where Mr. Abu Ghaith should be tried.     On Friday, a U.S. prosecutor told a federal court in New York that Mr. Abu Ghaith gave a 22-page statement to law enforcement after being taken into U.S. custody. That suggests the protections afforded defendants in the civilian justice system didn't prevent the U.S. from gaining at least some information in Mr. Abu Ghaith's case.     Update: Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, responded to the Republican criticism in a statement Friday afternoon, saying it would have been a "serious mistake" to send the suspect to Guantanamo and federal prosecutors were more likely to have success. "It is not clear whether a conspiracy case against Abu Ghaith could even be sustained in a military commission at Guantanamo Bay," said Mr. Leahy.
