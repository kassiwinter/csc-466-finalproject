WASHINGTON—President      Donald Trump        this week stepped up preparations to counter political and military challenges that could reshape his presidency, girding for a strike against Syria and pushing a campaign to discredit the Justice Department. Several aides described Mr. Trump seething over an FBI raid of his personal attorney’s files and expressing horror at pictures of lifeless Syrian children following a suspected chemical attack. The combination tested Mr. Trump’s ability to focus on—and compartmentalize—issues as few others have since his presidency began. It also made for another tumultuous week in the West Wing. “         Gary Cohn    used to tell us to ignore the chaos, that it can’t win in the long run,” one aide said early in the week, referring to the president’s former economic adviser. “It’s not only looking like it can, but that it is.”     Though he had taken no decisive action by Thursday, Mr. Trump had set out new, tougher approaches to the two issues.          Talking to Pentagon officials after the apparent gas attack, Mr. Trump called for a more sweeping retaliatory response than the military advised, one White House official said. He asked to consider options that would punish not only the Syrian regime but also two of its sponsors—Russia and Iran. “He’s pressed back” on suggestions from Defense Secretary         Jim Mattis    that the response should be more limited in scope, the official said.     Mr. Trump is also taking a more combative approach to Justice Department leaders, using both his megaphone and trusted surrogates to make the point the agency officials have overstepped.     On Monday, Mr. Trump was in a state of “extreme frustration” after the raid on         Michael Cohen’s    office, according to one senior administration official. With his jaw clenched and sharp, indrawn breaths revealing the extent of his anger, Mr. Trump complained to aides that FBI agents “broke into” the attorney’s office, the official said.         Related                The agents, as part of a probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, searched for records involving a hush payment made by Mr. Cohen to a former adult-film actress professionally known as Stormy Daniels.     The raid, based partly on a referral from special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    investigation into Russian meddling in the election campaign, suggested prosecutors were focusing on Mr. Trump’s personal life. Mr. Trump, one aide said, was “pissed off.”     Mr. Mueller, a White House official said, “appears to have gone from looking at Russian meddling to a quixotic search for the blue dress”—a reference to the stained dress worn by         Monica Lewinsky    during a liaison with former President Bill Clinton.     The result: Two people who spoke to Mr. Trump during the week said they came away thinking both         Rod Rosenstein,    the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions would soon be gone, potentially sparking a political and constitutional crisis.     “It’s a matter of when, not if,” said one person who has discussed the matter with Mr. Trump.

This week, his advisers told him to vent in public—on TV and Twitter—but not by picking up the phone and ordering personnel changes at the Justice Department.     In tweets over the course of the week, Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Mueller and, for the first time, Mr. Rosenstein. The White House in recent days has sought to build a case for the president to fire Mr. Rosenstein, according to officials and people close to the administration.     To avoid the impression that Mr. Trump is looking to interfere in the Russia investigation, the White House has called supporters outside the administration and urged them to attack the probe—and Mr. Rosenstein in particular—on TV, according to people familiar with the matter. The White House also has promoted the notion that the two top Justice Department officials have run afoul of Congress for not swiftly turning over documents related to a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman         Bob Goodlatte    (R., Va.).     Some congressional Republicans this week called for Mr. Rosenstein to be dismissed over the documents delay. “Let’s do it this week, and if this attorney general and deputy attorney general can’t do it—let’s find two who will,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.) said on Fox & Friends on Tuesday.     Of all the top Justice Department officials, Mr. Rosenstein faces the greatest risk of being forced out, according to people close to the administration. Senior advisers, including press secretary         Sarah Sanders,    have urged Mr. Trump not to take that step, warning of the political and legal fallout.     On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump on Twitter urged his followers to watch Fox News host         Sean Hannity’s    show—in which Mr. Hannity called for the attorney general to fire Mr. Rosenstein.     People close to the president said they believed the decision to raid Mr. Cohen’s properties has helped build sympathy for the president. “I think he’s inching closer to being viewed as a victim in this investigation,” said one person close to the president. “If he gets there, then he can throw pardons and firings left and right.”     Mr. Trump’s frustration over the Russia probe is unlikely to ease next week, when former FBI Director         James Comey    is set to release a new book that recounts his dealings with the president. It was Mr. Comey’s firing that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller.     When Mr. Trump publicly vented his frustration over the Cohen raid on Monday, he was surrounded by the nation’s military brass, who were at the White House to discuss how to respond to Syria.

Mr. Trump wanted to respond again, aides said. He expressed awareness to one confidant that the most recent suspected chemical attack, which killed dozens, came soon after Mr. Trump’s public comments that he wanted to withdraw troops from Syria.     Mr. Trump’s team privately pushed for a strong response that would try to cripple Syria’s ability to carry out further chemical-weapons attacks. White House officials said the U.S. needed to deliver a more forceful strike than it did a year ago.     The Pentagon expressed caution, wary of new strikes that could inadvertently kill Russians working alongside Syrian forces. Military officials worked to craft more narrowly tailored options that would reduce that risk.         John Bolton,    the new national security adviser in his first week on the job, advised the president to cancel his planned trip to South America this weekend.     Mr. Trump this week also sought to rally support from key allies, holding several calls with French President         Emmanuel Macron    and British Prime Minister         Theresa May.         Mr. Trump said Thursday that a decision would be made “fairly soon.” Ms. Sanders said in a statement later in the day that the president had concluded a meeting with his national security team without making a final decision, and that the president would be speaking to the leaders of the U.K. and France later in the evening.     Meanwhile, Mr. Trump was buoyed this week by what aides said was welcome news. Mr. Trump told confidants that he believes a deal is close on changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and was encouraged by a speech that Chinese President         Xi Jinping    delivered on Tuesday that eased fears of a trade war.     Economic advisers, including the newest member of his team, National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow, met privately with the president after Mr. Xi’s speech. They helped him craft a tweet Tuesday that read, “Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers.”     Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com, Michael C.
