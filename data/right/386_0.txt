      	Former Secretary of State John Kerry endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential bid Thursday, saying even President Trump understands that the former vice president can beat him in 2020.
“I believe Joe Biden is the President our country desperately needs right now, not because I’ve known Joe so long, but because I know Joe so well. I’ve never before seen the world more in need of someone who on day one can begin the incredibly hard work of putting back together the world Donald Trump has smashed apart,” the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate said in a press release.
“There’s never been a time more urgent for leadership at home that can work for the middle class and tackle existential issues like climate change where we are moving dangerously backwards,” Kerry added.
“Joe is uniquely the person running for president who can beat Donald Trump and get to work on day one at home and in the world with no time to waste.”
In a phone call with the Washington Post ahead of his formal endorsement announcement, Kerry highlighted the importance of beating Trump in the next election and his belief that Biden could achieve that.
“The president knows [that Biden could beat him]. And that’s why he was so busy dispatching Rudy Giuliani and engaging in unconstitutional behavior.”
The Biden campaign says Kerry will join Biden on the campaign trail on Friday in Iowa and on Sunday in New Hampshire, two states Kerry won in the 2004 primary.
