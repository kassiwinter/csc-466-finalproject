We acted on additional accounts today and they are no longer able to advertise with us," a spokeswoman for Facebook wrote in a statement emailed to Business Insider.The spokesperson shared a link to the specific rule that the publication violated, which is listed in its advertising policies: "Ads must not use tactics that are intended to circumvent our ad review process or other enforcement systems. This includes techniques that attempt to disguise the ad's content or destination page."'The Epoch Times is a nonpartisan media that is dedicated to truthful and accurate reporting'Business Insider reached out to Epoch Times Editor-in-Chief Jasper Fakker for comment but did not immediately hear back.The Epoch Times is a non-profit publication that's tied to a Chinese religious group named Falun Gong. According to NBC, Falun Gong seeks to undermine the Chinese government and sees Trump as a force for that goal.In a previous statement to Business Insider, Fakker acknowledged the publication's connections to Falun Gong but said that it isn't owned by the religious group. He also denied that its pro-Trump ads on Facebook were meant to be political."NBC News' statement is incorrect," Fakker said in an email exchange with Business Insider. "The Epoch Times advertisements are subscription advertisements for the print version of The Epoch Times. In the advertisements we discuss The Epoch Times editorial and feature content and encourage people to subscribe to us."Facebook has specific rules for advertising that require anyone - including a publisher like ourselves - to label content if it touches on social issues or politics, something some news content naturally does. The Epoch Times is a nonpartisan media that is dedicated to truthful and accurate reporting."Additional reporting by Rob Price.
