THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.—Shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday, a 28-year-old Marine Corps veteran strode up to the front entrance of a country music bar in this Los Angeles suburb that was hosting its weekly college dance party. As more than a hundred people sipped drinks and took line dancing lessons inside, Ian David Long, bearded and dressed in black, took out a .45 caliber pistol equipped with an extended magazine and shot the bouncer. Entering the door to the bar, he shot several more employees including a cashier while hurling a smoke bomb, witnesses told investigators. Then he turned his handgun on the crowd. In a matter of minutes, 12 people were killed, according to authorities. Long was later found dead inside the building, having apparently shot himself.           “It was like fish in a barrel,” said Matthew Curry, 20, who was walking from the dance floor when he heard five shots outside the bar before the shooter entered.               The country music blaring through the bar was pierced by the sounds of men crying and women screaming—and then, more gunfire. One man threw a bar stool through a window. Mr. Curry and others climbed through and jumped 8 feet to the ground below to escape, he said. “It was just mayhem.”         More Coverage        The bloodshed in this city 30 miles west of Los Angeles, which had only two homicides in all of 2017, came less than two weeks after a man shot and killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.      From Las Vegas to Parkland, Fla., Pittsburgh to Santa Fe, Texas, the nation has been shaken by the frequency of mass shootings over the past two years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says 30 active-shooter incidents in 2017 left in 138 people dead—both the highest totals since the FBI began keeping track in 2000. The FBI defines an active shooter as someone actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.          In an eerie echo of recent mass shootings, a group of survivors of the massacre at a country music festival in Las Vegas last year would meet at the bar in Thousand Oaks, encouraged to wear gear to mark surviving that attack. The bar had hosted benefit concerts for survivors and a vigil commemorating six months since that shooting.     A handful of those survivors were at the Borderline Bar & Grill during Wednesday night’s shooting, said Stacie Armentrout, spokeswoman for the group. One, a Navy veteran named Telemachus Orfanos, was among those killed, she said.     “We’re all sick to our stomachs and throwing up. It’s all back and washed right over the top of us again,” she said.     Authorities were trying to determine why Long, who served five years in the Marines and saw combat in Afghanistan as a machine-gunner, opened fire at Borderline, tucked away in a suburban strip mall. Long may have been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said at a briefing.     “It’s a horrific scene in there. There’s blood everywhere,” said Sheriff Dean, who called the shooting a “tragic, senseless loss of life.”     People who knew Long said he returned from his military service bulked up and apparently troubled in 2013, the same year his four-year marriage ended in divorce. His mother, with whom he lived, sometimes said she wished he would stay away, said a neighbor, Richard Berge.

Mental health responders arrived soon after but determined he wasn’t a threat and didn’t qualify for an involuntary psychiatric hold.     The shooter legally purchased the Glock pistol he used at a gun store in the city of Simi Valley in Ventura County, according to a law-enforcement official. He used an extended magazine during the attack, which may have been illegal in California. The state has outlawed magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds, but some older ones were exempted from that ban.

Some students told of confusion rippling through the crowd after the gunman opened fire. “It took a couple seconds for people to realize what was going on and chaos broke out,” said Cole Knapp, a 19-year-old college student.

When the gunman paused, possibly to reload, Mr. Knapp rushed to an outdoor balcony for smokers, crowded with people unaware of what was happening inside. He shouted for them to run.     Holden Harrah, 20, said that after he saw the shooter execute the cashier, he “fell to the floor to cover up for safety [and] started crawling.”     When Mr. Harrah reached his car, he started hyperventilating, he said, his hands contorted in panic.      Cassidy Addison, 23, was sitting at a table with two friends when she heard a shot. At first she thought it the sound of a balloon popping, but after the second shot, she saw people duck under tables and start running and she knew she needed to get out. She and her friends ran to the back of the bar and out the back door.      “I feel like I almost blacked out,” she said. “I just knew the gunshots were coming from the front, so I ran to the back.”     As he fired, the military-trained gunman was silent, witnesses said. He operated with lethal efficiency. Investigators believe only one person shot by Long survived, a sheriff’s department spokesman said. Twenty others suffered injuries while trying to escape, the spokesman added.                                         At least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire at a crowded bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Wednesday night. Sgt. Ron Helus, who responded at the scene, and Cody Coffman were among those killed.

They exchanged fire with the gunman and Sgt. Helus was hit, fatally.      “He died a hero. He went in to save lives,” said Sheriff Dean. Without Sgt. Helus’s quick action, he added, many more would have died.     On Thursday, authorities searched the Long home for clues.      Long served in the Marine Corps from 2008 to 2013 and was deployed to Afghanistan from 2010 through 2011, according to a summary of his service records. After leaving the Marines, he never used Department of Veterans Affairs health care benefits, according to a department spokesman.     Twenty veterans commit suicide each day on average and 14 of those didn’t seek government assistance, VA Secretary         Robert Wilkie    said recently.     Hours after the shooting, a crowd waited at a local teen center designated for people to reunite with loved ones.      Tucker Gibson, 19, had been searching for his childhood friend since first hearing news of the shooting at 5:30 a.m. He said he saw his friend’s brother at the center, but still couldn’t find the friend, who he knew frequented the bar.     “I came here from L.A. when I was 2 because my mom wanted to get away from danger,” Mr. Gibson said in disbelief.      Nearby Pepperdine University said it was providing counseling services to its students. Freshman Alaina Housley was among those killed, it said.     Jason Coffman learned that his 22-year-old son, Cody, was killed in the shooting. “I am speechless and heartbroken,” he said.     Wednesday night, he spoke to his son just before he went to the bar. “The first thing I said was ‘don’t drink and drive,’ ” Mr. Coffman said. “The last thing I said was, ‘Son, I love you.’ ”     —Julie Jargon, Erin Ailworth, Jim Carlton, Sara Randazzo, Benjamin Kesling, Jim Oberman and Elisa Cho contributed to this article.
