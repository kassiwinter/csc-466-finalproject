  	As expected, Speaker John Boehner has caved and now will support President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty.
On Tuesday, Boehner plans to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives a bill that funds Obama’s amnesty in its entirety for the rest of the fiscal year. “Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will vote Tuesday on the Senate’s bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, a move that could enrage a small pocket of conservatives but will end the impasse over the agency’s funding,” Politico wrote in a breaking news alert.
This flip-flop comes after months of Boehner saying he wouldn’t do this.
“The House has acted. We’ve done our job. Senate Democrats are the ones putting us in this precarious position,” Boehner said on Fox News Sunday recently.
It’s unclear whether the vote will pass later on Tuesday, but if it does there are likely to be serious consequences against Boehner for having now flip-flopped into supporting Obama’s executive amnesty.
It’s interesting that Boehner chose the day that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to address Congress as cover for his cave on executive amnesty, and may begin to call into question his motives behind inviting the Israeli leader to speak to Congress. It could have all been a part of a show to distract Republicans into supporting Obama’s executive amnesty, as he now does.
