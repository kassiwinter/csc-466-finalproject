                                                                                                                                         Americans have named former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton their most admired woman anywhere in the world for the 13th straight year and President Obama the most admired man for the seventh straight year, Gallup said.                                                                                                                                                      Twelve percent said Mrs. Clinton was the women they admired most, followed by Oprah Winfrey at 8 percent, Nobel prize winner Malala Yousafzai at 5 percent, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at 4 percent.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Obama, the choice of 19 percent for most admired male, beat out Pope Francis at 6 percent and former President Bill Clinton at 3 percent.                                                                                                                                                                    Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she runs, has held the top spot in 17 of the last 18 years; first lady Laura Bush was at the top in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.                                                                                                                              Rounding out the top 10 most admired females are First Lady Michelle Obama (3 percent), actress Angelina Jolie (2 percent), former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (2 percent), Princess Kate (2 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (1 percent) and Mrs. Bush (1 percent).                                                                                                                                                                 On the male side, the Rev. Billy Graham and former President George W. Bush were at 2 percent, followed by 1 percent apiece for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, tech pioneer Bill Gates, Fox News host Bill Oâ€™Reilly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The results are based on interviews conducted Dec. 8-11 of 805 adults, and the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
