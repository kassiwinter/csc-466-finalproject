More        Digging up information on rivals is standard practice among U.S. political campaigns, but receiving such information from a foreign entity without informing the FBI risks running afoul of laws intended to prevent foreign influence in the U.S. election process.          The remarks come as Mr. Trump still faces questions from Democrats about the 2016 presidential campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election. Former special counsel Robert Mueller found evidence of Russian interference, but his investigation didn’t establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.     House Democrats have launched numerous investigations into the election and some have called for impeachment proceedings over allegations that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct Mr. Mueller’s probe—which Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied.     The president said in the ABC interview, conducted by George Stephanopoulos, that “the FBI doesn’t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressmen, they all do it, they always have, and that’s the way it is.

Last year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that a meeting his son         Donald Trump Jr.    held with a Russian government lawyer in June 2016 was an attempt “to get information on” Hillary Clinton but he defended the meeting as “totally legal.”     Mr. Mueller in his report said he decided not to pursue criminal charges against the younger Mr. Trump over the meeting because the special counsel believed it would be difficult to prove that Mr. Trump Jr. and other campaign officials were aware that such conduct was potentially unlawful or knew that the value of the information promised to the campaign exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation.     During the ABC News interview, Mr. Trump was asked whether his son should have taken the meeting. “Somebody comes up and says, ‘Hey, I have information on your opponent,’ do you call the FBI?” Trump responded.     “I’ll tell you what, I’ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don’t call the FBI. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you do,” Mr. Trump said. “Oh, give me a break—life doesn’t work that way.”
