WASHINGTON—Republicans blocked the Senate from voting Thursday on two of President         Barack Obama's    nominees, reviving the prospect of a broader fight over nominations that both parties have said could poison relations and shut down all other business in the chamber.Two prominent Obama nominees—Rep.         Mel Watt    (D., N.C.), picked to head the agency that oversees         Fannie Mae    and         Freddie Mac,    and         Patricia Millett,    nominated for a seat on a key federal appeals court—failed to clear procedural hurdles in back-to-back votes. Each fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance. The GOP opposition angered the majority Democrats, who said they were considering whether to take new steps to limit Republicans' ability to prevent confirmation votes.                                                  Patricia Millett, left, has been nominated to a key appeals court.

Thursday's votes—one of which involved the rare step of blocking a sitting member of Congress from an executive post—threatened to interrupt a period of relative comity in the two weeks since the two parties ended a budget fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Lawmakers earlier this week confirmed nominees to two key federal agencies and began budget negotiations Wednesday with an unusually conciliatory meeting.     Thursday's action left Democrats incensed. "If [nominees with] these kinds of qualifications can't get through the byzantine rules of the Senate, maybe it's time for us to seriously consider changing those rules," said Sen.         Michael Bennet    (D., Colo.) .     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said he expected the Senate to reconsider the nominations of Ms. Millett and Mr. Watt in the "very near future" and voted no on both to preserve that option. He also said he wouldn't make a decision Thursday on whether to invoke what is known as the "nuclear option" of the rules change.                                                 Rep. Mel Watt has been nominated to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                              The move discussed this past summer would have ended the need for Democrats to corral 60 votes to cut off debate on executive-branch nominees. But a deal was reached that averted any rule changes.     Republicans cautioned that Democrats could live to regret any permanent rules changes. "I don't think any of them would want to see a Republican president in 2016 having a 51-vote right to have another Justice [Antonin] Scalia or somebody else on the Supreme Court," said Sen.         Bob Corker    (R., Tenn.).     Some say such a change would harm the Senate's traditionally courteous culture. "It will make this chamber even more polarized than it already is," Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the chamber's second-highest ranking Republican, warned on the Senate floor Thursday.     Democrats indicated Thursday they wanted to let the fight over presidential nominees play out longer before coalescing behind any changes. Mr. Reid said he planned to line up votes on two more nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, for which Ms. Millett was nominated. With the GOP likely to oppose those nominees as they did Ms. Millett, that could give Democrats incentive to push for rules changes for judicial nominees.     Including new Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), the Senate has 55 members of the Democratic caucus and 45 Republicans.     Ms. Millett, a Washington lawyer, received 55 votes—including two from Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—in favor of moving forward on her nomination to the District of Columbia Circuit Court, often considered the nation's second-most powerful court. It regularly hears legal challenges to federal regulations and has been a stepping stone for Supreme Court nominees.     Thursday clash's had little to do with Ms. Millett's qualifications. A former Justice Department lawyer who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, she has argued 32 cases at the Supreme Court. Both sides have spoken highly of her resume.     Her fight is part of a broader battle about the Washington appeals court, which long has been at the center of political sparring over the direction of the judiciary. Each party at times has resisted filling some vacancies on the court, which is split 4-4 between active judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents. However, the court's semiretired "senior" judges still hear cases, and most of those were appointed by Republicans.     Mr. Watt was nominated in May to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which controls the government-supported mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and has become one of the most important economic-policy posts in Washington. He received 56 votes, including from two Republicans: Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio.     But other Republicans said a politician shouldn't oversee two companies that were lobbying forces before they collapsed during the financial crisis. Several lawmakers have said the agency would be better suited by a "technocrat" with deeper regulatory experience, and many prefer the agency's acting director,         Edward DeMarco,    who has at times resisted White House policy preferences. The agency was created by Congress in July 2008 to oversee Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Home Loan Banks and has never had a Senate-confirmed director.     Mr. Watt has offered few specifics about how he would lead the agency, which did little to calm Republicans' fears that the independent regulatory agency would be heavily influenced by the White House. Keeping Mr. DeMarco could help Republicans maintain greater leverage over the shape of any overhaul.     If Mr. Watt isn't ultimately confirmed, the White House could take other steps to replace Mr. DeMarco. It could name a new acting director from one of three FHFA senior directors, it could bypass the Senate by nominating Mr. Watt through a recess appointment, or it could nominate a new director.     The Obama administration had considered Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, before nominating Mr. Watt. At least two Republican senators had signaled openness to supporting Mr. Zandi before Mr. Watt was selected in May.     The Obama administration has clashed publicly and privately with Mr. DeMarco, who has served since 2009 as the FHFA's acting director. He has come under withering criticism from liberal political activist groups and some Democrats in Congress for not approving more generous borrower relief in the aftermath of the foreclosure crisis. Many Republicans have lauded Mr. DeMarco for his management of Fannie and Freddie     Administration and industry officials have grown more concerned in recent weeks over the way in which Mr. DeMarco has moved ahead to unilaterally shrink the footprint of Fannie and Freddie. Current and former administration officials have said that Mr. Watt would be better suited to overseeing the transition of Fannie and Freddie than Mr. DeMarco.      White House press secretary         Jay Carney    said Mr. Obama is disappointed in the Senate vote and is committed to seeing Mr. Watt's nomination through.     "We absolutely believe that Mel Watt is enormously qualified… "We know that he would do a good job, and there's a heck of a lot of important work that needs to be done in that agency," he said.      —Carol E.
