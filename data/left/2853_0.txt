After Democrats lost the Georgia special election (and, you know, every other special election this year) there's a lot of talk about whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should step down from her Democratic leadership role.Now President Trump's getting in on the chatter and threw Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer into the mix."I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out," he tweeted Thursday morning. "That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!"Pelosi responded later that morning, saying it was a typical Republican line – and that she believed Trump was provided it by members of his party. "He then added the Chuck Schumer bit," she said at a briefing.Pelosi defended her position and said she was a master legislator and a politically astute leader. And while she said she respects the opinions of the members of her caucus, she added, "My decision of how long I stay is not up to them."Since Jon Ossoff lost to Karen Handel on Tuesday night, a few congressional Democrats have started to talk about changing the top leadership in the caucus, including Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, according to CNN."We need leadership change," Rice told CNN. "It's time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team."According to Politico, Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas said, "You'd have to be an idiot" to think winning the House in 2018 was possible with Pelosi in charge.“Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost," Vela said. "But she certainly is one of the reasons.”Still, even in the wake of the Georgia special election loss, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Rep. Ben Ray Luján on Wednesday said he believed Democrats could win enough seats for a House majority in 2018.
