                                                Police officers walked near the crime scene Friday.          Matt Rourke/Associated Press                                                                                                             Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Friday took to Twitter to urge the Obama administration to detain a suspected Boston Marathon bomber as an enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes if he is captured alive.     "The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to 'remain silent,'" said a post on Mr. Graham's official Twitter account. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the two brothers identified by authorities on Friday as suspects in Monday's Boston bombings, could be a "treasure trove of information" if he's connected to overseas terror groups, another tweet said. A spokesman for Mr. Graham didn't respond to a request for comment.      What does the law say about that? Could the Justice Department legally question and detain the suspect outside the criminal justice system?     The short answer is no, says Benjamin Wittes, a national security expert for the Brookings Institution and co-founder of Lawfare Blog, a national security blog.          Federal courts have said the president has the authority to detain persons "who were part of, or substantially supported, Taliban or al-Qaida forces or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States," a power claimed by the Obama administration and codified by Congress.     So unless there's evidence that Mr. Tsarnaev is linked to any terrorist group at war with America, "military detention is simply not lawfully available," said Mr. Wittes. And there's also the fact he's a U.S. citizen pursued on American soil. That's not necessarily a legal barrier, but a barrier under Obama administration policy, said Mr. Wittes.     But that doesn't mean authorities would have to follow Miranda procedures right away. The law offers some flexibility, with what's known as the "public safety" exception to the Miranda rule.     It stems from a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court case (New York v. Quarles) involving a Queens man charged with criminal gun possession. A witness told police the man raped her and had a gun. When they found him at an A&P supermarket, he had an empty shoulder holster. An officer, after handcuffing him, asked him where the gun was. The man gestured toward a stack of liquid-soap cartons, where police found a loaded revolver.     Lower courts tossed the evidence because the man was wasn't read his rights before handcuffed and questioned. The Supreme Court disagreed, articulating a 'public safety' exception.     The FBI considers the exception to be a "powerful tool with a modern application for law enforcement," wrote Carl Benoit, a legal instructor at the FBI Academy in a law enforcement bulletin. He wrote:     When police officers are confronted by a concern for public safety, Miranda warnings need not be provided prior to asking questions directed at neutralizing an imminent threat, and voluntary statements made in response to such narrowly tailored questions can be admitted at trial. The circumstances with Mr. Tsarnaev are obviously very different. But Mr. Wittes said the Quarles case offers some flexibility, particularly since the suspect could be carrying a bomb.     Says Mr. Wittes: "You do have under 'Quarles' some period of time at least to make sure there aren't other accomplices running around, and to make sure that if there is a foreign connection, that this isn't part of some unfolding plot of attacks."
