Images from the scene showed pedestrians sprawled on the ground, with blood streaming from a woman surrounded by a scattering of postcards."They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben," he said. "A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw."The former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski posted a video on Twitter that seems to show people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge.Sikorski, a senior fellow at the Harvard Centre for European Studies, says he saw at least five people lying on the ground after being "mown down" by a car.Sikorski told the BBC he "heard what I thought what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and someone down, obviously in great distress."Then I saw a second person down, and I started filming, then I saw three more people down, one of them bleeding profusely."PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY RUSHED TO SAFETY AFTER ATTACK OUTSIDE UK PARLIAMENTPrime Minister Theresa May was rushed to safety after the attack."The thoughts of the PM and the government are with those killed and injured in this appalling incident, and with their families," May's office said in a statement.In a prime-time address to the nation outside 10 Downing Street, May praised the "exceptional bravery" of police, and thanked them and other emergency services "on behalf of the whole country."May said it was "no accident" the attacker chose Parliament, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law.The White House condemned the attacks, adding that President Trump is continuing to monitor developments out of London.Spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday Trump spoke with May and said that the White House applauds "the quick response of British police and first responders."The White House said Trump "pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice."The U.S. State Department said it is closely monitoring the incident and urged Americans in London to avoid the area.Spokesman Mark Toner said Wednesday: "We stand ready to assist in any way the U.K. authorities would find helpful."He added that the U.S. Embassy in London is closely following the news and stands ready to help any affected Americans."Our hearts go out to those affected," Toner said.Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the British government's "top priority" is the security of its people, following the attack."The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values: values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law," Rudd said in a clip broadcast on Sky News.Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts said he saw a man in black attack a police officer outside Parliament before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the House of Commons."He had something in his hand, it looked like a stick of some sort, and he was challenged by a couple of policemen in yellow jackets," Letts told the BBC. "And one of the yellow-jacketed policemen fell down and we could see the man in black moving his arm in a way that suggested he was stabbing or striking the yellow-jacketed policeman."Dennis Burns, who was just entering Parliament for a meeting, told the Press Association he heard a radio message saying an officer had been stabbed. Police and security rushed outside as he was going in."When I got inside I was wondering what the hell was going on and I saw dozens of panicked people running down the street," he said. "The first stream was around 30 people and the second stream was 70 people. It looked like they were running for their lives."UK PARLIAMENT ATTACK IS THE LATEST TERROR SCARE FOR LONDONBritish security has thwarted some 13 terror plots over the past four years, but the UK has largely been spared major international terror attacks such as the ones seen in Belgium and France.Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
