      House and Senate Democrats said they reject an opening offer from Republicans on a new coronavirus aid package, even though most of the GOP plan is still in negotiations.      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Thursday the Republican plan to reduce enhanced unemployment benefits is unacceptable and the overall $1 trillion price tag of the GOP proposal falls far short of what is needed to combat the virus and its economic impact.            “They are engaged in distortions, delays, and denial,” said Pelosi, a California Democrat. “It’s very damaging to our economy, very deadly to our people.”      Democrats said they would not accept a piecemeal approach to a new round of federal funding and suggested they would not support a temporary stand-alone extension of unemployment insurance enhancements that expire this month.      “No way,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. “This is a comprehensive proposal that addresses the many problems of COVID, and we have to address it as a totality.”      Senate Republicans are preparing to release a $1 trillion package that includes funding for education and testing, as well as new direct payments to people and families. The measure is also expected to extend expanded unemployment benefits, but the GOP is determined to reduce the benefit from the current $600-per-week level because it pays many workers more to stay home than to return to their jobs.      But Democrats say they don’t want to reduce the amount and accused the GOP of caring more about corporate interests than struggling unemployed workers.      Democrats want the GOP to take up a House-passed $3 trillion coronavirus aid package they call the Heroes Act because it provides hazard pay for frontline workers, among many other expenditures. The House bill would extend unemployment insurance benefits at the current $600-per-week level.      “I go to the table with the commitment for the $600," Pelosi said. “Why are they worried about whether it's 600 or 400 or 500? People really need that.”      Senate Republicans met Thursday morning with Trump administration officials to continue hammering out a deal. Lawmakers said they are close to releasing a measure, but Democrats are playing up internal party divisions over the size and scope of the measure.      Democrats said the GOP is in disarray over the $1 trillion proposal, which has led to a delay in a bipartisan deal.       “They are so divided,” Schumer said. “And there's no leadership from the president. And he doesn't know how to solve this problem. So much of the illness and so much of the deaths and so much of the economic hardship and health hardship is because this administration has no direction, no plan. No straight line of attack.”
