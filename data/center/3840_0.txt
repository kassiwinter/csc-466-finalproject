As         Matthew Whitaker    took charge of the Justice Department this week, Democrats and some Republicans questioned the legality of his appointment to serve as acting attorney general. No court has ruled directly on the relevant questions, so the answer isn’t clear. The Constitution requires the president to obtain the Senate’s “advice and consent” when appointing cabinet members and other principal “officers of the United States.” In dividing the appointment power between the executive and the Congress, the framers hoped to limit cronyism and self-interest.     The Constitution also allows the president to make temporary appointments when the Senate is in recess.               At the same time, the Constitution assigns Congress power to establish methods of appointing various federal officers. The current rules for filling most offices temporarily are spelled out by the Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. At the time, then         Sen. Fred Thompson    (R., Tenn.) said on the Senate floor the act came partly in response to excesses by the Justice Department.     “In 1973, the Justice Department, in seeking to appoint a temporary FBI director in the midst of the Watergate scandal, appointed         L. Patrick Gray    without complying with the terms of the Vacancies Act,” said the late Mr. Thompson, who co-sponsored the bill.     Another co-sponsor,         Sen. Robert Byrd    (D., W.Va.), invoked both Proverbs and Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” in calling upon the Senate 20 years ago to reassert its powers. “Let us awaken to the threat posed by circumventions by the executive branch of the appointments clause,” Mr. Byrd said.     The law is important, because it says decisions by an official improperly installed will have “no force or effect.” In general under the act, an acting official can serve for 210 days.     The question may not be resolved until Mr. Whitaker, or the DOJ under his authority, takes an action against some individual or group that then sues, arguing that Mr. Whitaker wasn’t properly appointed.     The Vacancies Reform Act also provides that the “first assistant” becomes the acting officer when an agency head departs. That is what happened on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of President Trump’s inauguration, when Attorney General         Loretta Lynch    resigned and the deputy attorney general,         Sally Yates,    became acting attorney general. (President Trump dismissed her 10 days later after she concluded his initial travel ban was unlawful.)     Ms. Yates already held a Senate-confirmed position, which the Vacancies Act lists as a qualification for service as an acting officer; Mr. Whitaker does not. While he once had a Senate-confirmed position, as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, that doesn’t count under the law.     Another category of individuals eligible to serve as acting officials until the Senate confirms a permanent nominee are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.     Mr. Whitaker apparently qualifies under that definition. But critics say it was only intended to apply to subordinate officials, not cabinet members who report directly to the president. Those who say Mr. Whitaker was improperly appointed consider that a key argument for their case.     Supreme Court precedent distinguishes between “principal officers,” who must be appointed by the president with Senate approval, and “inferior officers,” who can be installed through other methods authorized by Congress.     “I am not aware of any precedent for appointment of an official who has not been confirmed by the Senate to serve as Acting Attorney General,” Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) said in a letter to the president Friday.     In response, a Justice Department official said         Mr. Trump’s    authority to install Mr. Whitaker was presaged by a 2003 opinion from the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which concluded that President         George W. Bush    could name a non-confirmed employee of the Office of Management and Budget as the agency’s acting director.     The OMB director, like the attorney general, is a principal officer. The 2003 opinion avoided that problem by defining an acting director as an “inferior officer.”     That document was written by         Ed Whelan,    a prominent Republican lawyer who then headed the Office of Legal Counsel. The title appearing under his signature: acting assistant attorney general.     Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
