It’s a wonderful opportunity,” he said at a polling place a few miles from his home.  Before he was handed his ballot, a poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama. “That’s me,” he said.  “This is the most important office of democracy, the office of citizenry,” he added.  He wouldn’t say for whom he cast his ballot, but he offered a hint at his next stop: a visit to the campaign office of Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn.  “I want everybody to know I just voted,” Obama told volunteers there, joined by Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin (D), who has a clear lead in the polls. “Could not have been smoother.”  “The way we win any election is making sure we turn out,” he later added as he made his way around the room to speak to volunteers.  “This is me 30 years ago. All energetic. That’s great,” he said. Follow @politico
