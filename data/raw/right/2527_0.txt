  	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump now leads Hillary Clinton by one point, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post national tracking poll.
Trump earns the support of 46 percent of likely voters while Clinton only earns 45 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has three percent support and Jill Stein only has two percent. Since Friday, Clinton has lost 7 points among voters who are enthusiastic about her candidacy. Trump leads Clinton by eight points among voters who are very enthusiastic about his bid.
ABC News warns that Trump is technically only leading by 0.7 points and reminds readers that Romney led the poll by one point in 2012 before he lost to President Barack Obama.
“Taking it to the decimal for illustrative purposes, a mere seven-tenths of a percentage point divides them,” the release warns.
