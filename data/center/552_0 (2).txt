But those measures will run out in about 20 days, although the exact date could vary, Yellen said."This uncertainty underscores the critical importance of not waiting to raise or suspend the debt limit," she said.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Susan HeaveyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
