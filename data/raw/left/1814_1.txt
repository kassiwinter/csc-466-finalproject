An expense report obtained by Watchdog.org by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request shows that in 2010 and 2011 New Jersey governor Chris Christie paid $82,594 to Delaware North Sportservice, a company that operates the concessions at MetLife Stadium, home to the Giants and Jets.
The charges were made on 58 occasions. You can see the expense report here. Delaware North Sportservice is notated as “DNC Sports.”
The New Jersey Republican State Committee then paid back the state treasury in 2012 for all the charges made at MetLife Stadium.
“The official nature and business purpose of the event remains the case regardless of whether the event is at the State House, Drumthwacket or a sporting venue,” said Christie’s press secretary Kevin Roberts.
From Watchdog.org:
Christie spent $360,000 from his state allowance during his five years in office. More than 80 percent of that money, or $300,000, was used to buy food, alcohol and desserts, according to a New Jersey Watchdog analysis of records released by the governor’s office.
In addition to his $175,000 a year salary, the governor receives $95,000 a year in expense advances, paid quarterly by the state. In the state budget, it is listed as “an allowance of funds not otherwise appropriated and used for official receptions on behalf of the state, the operation of an official residence, for other expenses.”
Current laws do not require Christie to attach receipts to his expenses, but there is a new law under consideration, A-4424, that would do so.
