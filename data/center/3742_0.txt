WASHINGTON—A federal appeals-court panel split in 2014 over a case involving a grisly theme-park death, ruling 2-1 that the Labor Department was on sound footing when it sanctioned         SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.    for safety violations after a trainer was attacked by a killer whale.The two judges upholding the sanction said that while whale-training is a dangerous occupation, SeaWorld could have taken steps to reduce the hazard. One of those judges was         Merrick Garland,    the Obama Supreme Court nominee whom Senate Republicans declined to consider after Justice         Antonin Scalia    died in 2016. In dissent was Judge         Brett Kavanaugh,    President      Donald Trump’s        current nominee for the high court. Judge Kavanaugh said the case raised the question of “when should we as a society paternalistically decide” whether people who choose to work in risky sports and entertainment fields “must be protected from themselves.”                                                 Tilikum, a SeaWorld killer whale, performing in 2009. The whale dragged a trainer underwater to her death in 2010.

He often has favored employers, sometimes embracing positions that other colleagues found too broad or conservative.               Yet his record isn’t monolithic; he wrote opinions that sided with employees in several instances, including a racial-discrimination case he has described as one of the most significant of his career.     “If you had to characterize him one way or the other, he’s pro-employer, but he’s not an ideologue,” said         Collin O’Connor Udell,    a lawyer with Jackson Lewis P.C. who represents employers and has studied Judge Kavanaugh’s rulings.     Several Democrats have signaled they will emphasize labor issues during Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation proceedings, and activists and labor groups have singled out a list of his opinions for criticism.     Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation team, said his record “reflects his reputation as a fair and independent arbiter of the law, based on text and precedent, who has ruled for both employers and employees.”     Appeals-court rulings are generally handed down by panels of three judges, assigned randomly from the court’s full roster. The D.C. Circuit was more conservative during the early stages of Judge Kavanaugh’s tenure but has become more liberal with the addition of Obama appointees, as reflected in some of his splits with his colleagues.      In 2008, Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissent supporting a kosher-meat wholesaler that refused to bargain with a union because it included undocumented workers who had participated in a union election. Two other judges said language of the National Labor Relations Act, as well as Supreme Court precedent, ran counter to that position.     A year earlier, the judge wrote a 2-to-1 ruling saying the Defense Department could curtail collective bargaining for hundreds of thousands of civilian employees for several years. A dissenting judge said Judge Kavanaugh’s opinion empowered the secretary of defense to abolish collective bargaining, “a position with which even the secretary disagrees.”                                         When the Supreme Court’s fall term begins in October, justices will hear cases that could impact the criminal justice system, major tech companies and charities.

Overall, Judge Kavanaugh’s rulings show skepticism of what he views as aggressive enforcement going beyond government agencies’ traditional authority.     He has found several times that the National Labor Relations Board “jumped the rails,” as he put it in a 2017 dissent, saying the board wrongly found that CNN engaged in unfair labor practices by replacing unionized contract technicians with in-house nonunion workers. Again his views parted with Chief Judge Garland, who wrote the court’s opinion faulting the network on some issues.     Judge Kavanaugh wrote several rulings finding for employers that had no dissenters. That happened in 2015, when he wrote a unanimous decision that bucked the NLRB and held that AT&T Connecticut acted reasonably in barring workers from wearing union T-shirts that said “Inmate” on the front and “Prisoner of AT$T” on the back.     When Judge Kavanaugh recently listed his most significant judicial opinions on a Senate questionnaire, he cited a pro-worker decision among them.     The judge was part of a 2013 panel that revived a lawsuit brought by a Fannie Mae employee who alleged he was denied a salary increase because of his race, called the N-word by his supervisor, and fired for complaining about it. Judge Kavanaugh, in a concurrence quoting poet Langston Hughes, wrote that even a single use of such a racial slur can create a hostile work environment.     “No other word in the English language so powerfully or instantly calls to mind our country’s long and brutal struggle to overcome racism and discrimination against African-Americans,” he wrote.     Judge Kavanaugh also has written unanimous rulings for employees, including a 2008 decision that upheld an NLRB determination that         Walmart    had a duty to continue bargaining with meat-processing workers in Texas after it changed the nature of its operations.      The judge has written especially forcefully in cases of alleged discrimination. Last year he was part of a panel that revived a Hispanic man’s case alleging a supervisor at the Department of Housing and Urban Development denied him a job transfer because of hostility toward minorities.     Judge Kavanaugh said his court should jettison precedents saying discriminatory transfers ordinarily aren’t a basis for suing under federal civil-rights law. He said he looked forward to clarifying that in a future case.
