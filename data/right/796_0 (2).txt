McConnell made the comment when asked by reporters if he saw any need to have a special prosecutor named to examine the tax-collection agency's targeting of conservative groups. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid echoed those same sentiments Tuesday, saying he believed IRS chief Steven Miller was doing a good job.
While some Republicans have called for the resignation of Miller, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told journalists, "As far as I know he is doing a good job"
The Department of Justice is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to probe the Internal Revenue Service over its targeting of conservative political groups.                                                                                 © 2022 Thomson/Reuters.
