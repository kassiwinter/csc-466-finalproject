Dan Senor, a respected Republican strategist who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, suggested on Friday that Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick once found the real estate mogul’s politics repulsive.In a tweet just hours after Trump announced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) as his running mate, Senor said he found the choice perplexing considering the two had previously shared a distaste for the candidate.It's disorienting to have had commiserated w/someone re: Trump - about how he was unacceptable, & then to see that someone become Trump's VP— Dan Senor (@dansenor) July 15, 2016
Senor has never been a fan of the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. When Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski last month amid reports that he had been failing at his job, Senor characterized the shakeup as an effort to find a scapegoat for the campaign’s shortcomings.“Donald Trump has a Donald Trump problem, not a Corey Lewandowski problem,” he told “CBS This Morning.”Senor has also raised questions about whether the candidate is fit to receive classified intelligence briefings and has repeatedly denounced what he refers to as “offensive” statements and proposals.He’s not only one who has used that word to describe Trump.Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.— Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015
Many have questioned how Pence will mesh with Trump, as speculation grew this week about the Indiana governor being tapped for the VP slot. Pence is pro-trade and pro-Iraq War, two positions that directly conflict with Trump’s campaign platform. And he didn’t even support Trump earlier this year.Pence penned an op-ed in May ahead of the Indiana GOP primary, giving a half-hearted endorsement to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R). At the same time, he gave an interview in which he was careful to “particularly commend” Trump for “giving voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with the lack of progress in Washington, D.C.”Not everyone bought Pence’s diplomatic approach, however.The National Review’s Tim Alberta reported in April that longtime friends of Pence’s said the governor “loathes” Trump. Alberta stood by that reporting on Friday.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.Republicans Who Have Refused To Back Donald Trump
