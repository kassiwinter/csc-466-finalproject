Former President Barack Obama warned about the "dangers" of the Internet and social media in a sitdown with Great Britain's Prince Harry.
Though he did not mention President Trump specifically, he said leaders around the world must use their platforms to help people find "common ground."
"One of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases," said Obama in a BBC Radio interview which was recorded in September at the Invictus Games in Canada.
Obama, who has spoken rarely since leaving office nearly a year ago, said before the internet Americans could agree on a "common set of facts," since a large majority received their information from the same sources.
He said the First Amendment is "very strong" in the U.S. and he would not advise a government solution to the problem. "All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the internet," said Obama, warning of a "Balkanization" of society. According to reports, Prince Harry and his fiancée, Meghan Markle, want to invite the Obama to their May 19 wedding. Harry said Wednesday the guest list has not been finalized.
