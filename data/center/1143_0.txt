         WASHINGTON—The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away Arizona's bid to revive a state law that would have banned most abortions after a woman's pregnancy reached 20 weeks.     The law, signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer in April 2012, would have barred abortions past the 20-week mark except in cases of medical emergencies. The San Francisco-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stepped in and blocked enforcement of the abortion restrictions before they went into effect.      A federal trial judge in Arizona initially upheld the law. But a three-judge appellate panel said a line of Supreme Court rulings dating from the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision made clear that a state "simply cannot proscribe a woman from choosing to obtain an abortion before the fetus is viable," which generally happens around the 24th week of gestation.           Related           The Supreme Court left the Ninth Circuit ruling in place without offering any comment on the case, issuing a brief one-line order denying Arizona's request for the high court to review its law.               Arizona officials defending the statute said the state had an interest in protecting fetuses from excruciating pain and in protecting maternal health.     Several states recently have passed, or are considering, laws similar to Arizona's. A group of 16 states had filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to consider Arizona's appeal.     Three obstetrician-gynecologists challenged the law, saying it would prevent women who have tried to continue high-risk pregnancies from obtaining abortions when complications grew too severe.     Abortion-rights groups have criticized the stream of recent state abortion laws as attempts to deny women their constitutional rights.     The push for additional abortion restrictions has led to a new wave of litigation, but the Supreme Court to date hasn't appeared eager to get involved.     The justices last November chose not to consider two attempts by Oklahoma to revive state abortion measures struck down in lower courts. One law would have required a woman to undergo an ultrasound of her fetus before proceeding with an abortion. The other law effectively would have prohibited drug-induced abortions.     The high-court that same month, by a 5-4 vote, also refused to intervene in an abortion-rights challenge to a Texas provision requiring physicians who perform abortions to hold admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the service is provided. Dissenting justices said the measure left two dozen Texas counties with no abortion provider.     A New Orleans-based federal appeals court has allowed the Texas law to take effect while legal proceedings continue.     —Brent Kendall        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
