BURLINGTON, Iowa—Former Texas Rep.         Beto O’Rourke    joined the 2020 presidential race Thursday, aiming to parlay his turn as one of the Democratic stars of the 2018 midterm elections into a run at his party’s nomination.Mr. O’Rourke is the 15th Democrat to enter the contest. He joins the race as an instant first-tier candidate, commanding an online donor network second in size only to the one         Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders    carried over from his 2016 presidential effort. “I’m running to serve you as president of the United States of America,” Mr. O’Rourke said in a video his campaign released Thursday morning.     Mr. O’Rourke made his first campaign stops Thursday in southeast Iowa, in towns along the Mississippi River that backed Democratic President Obama in 2012 and flipped to then-Republican candidate      Donald Trump        in 2016. Much as he did in his 2018 run against Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. O’Rourke presented himself as a Democrat looking to work with Republicans and to seek solutions he said would transcend partisan appeal.          “Let us not allow our differences to define us at this moment,” Mr. O’Rourke told a crowd of about 150 people at the Beancounter coffee shop in Burlington. “History calls for us to come together, to show ourselves, our fellow Americans, the generations that follow, what we are made of and what we can do. And the only way to get that done is to get it done together.”     The 2020 presidential field is dominated by Democrats who have won statewide office as a senator or governor. He enters the race more than two months after         Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren    became the first candidate to kick off a campaign Dec. 31. Since then, Sens. Sanders, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York,         Cory Booker    of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have announced their candidacies, along with former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Washington state         Gov. Jay Inslee,    among others. Former Vice President      Joe Biden        is widely expected to formalize his campaign in the coming weeks.     While Mr. O’Rourke visited Iowa on Thursday, Mr. Biden and         Stacey Abrams,    both of whom are weighing presidential bids, met privately in Washington, D.C. Ms. Abrams, who was narrowly defeated in her race for Georgia governor last year, also met for breakfast Thursday with Ms. Gillibrand. A person familiar with her schedule said Ms. Abrams had previously met privately with Sens. Warren, Booker, Harris and Klobuchar.     Mr. O’Rourke, who represented El Paso for three terms in the House, became a national figure during his 2018 Senate race against Mr. Cruz. Mr. O’Rourke lost by less than 3 percentage points while raising $80 million, smashing Senate fundraising records.     Along the way Mr. O’Rourke, 46 years old, transformed himself from a relatively anonymous congressman with few legislative accomplishments under his belt into a Democratic folk hero. In the final days of the Senate campaign, celebrities such as basketball star LeBron James and singer Beyoncé sported hats bearing Mr. O’Rourke’s black-and-white campaign logo.     Many Democrats say Mr. O’Rourke’s appeal lies in his authenticity, pointing to his live-streaming broadcasts of mundane elements of his campaign, such as filling the campaign van with gasoline and driving across vast reaches of Texas, during his stops at all 254 of the state’s counties. The Senate campaign didn’t employ a pollster, though it relied on other data about Texas voters.        
The Democrats’ 2020 Quest        Mr. O’Rourke, who drew thousands of people to his events in Texas last year, aimed to meet with small audiences during his initial Iowa circuit, an aide said. His three-day itinerary includes events in private homes, at labor halls and the taping of a popular local podcast.     The son of a Texas county judge, Mr. O’Rourke toured the country in a punk rock band following his graduation from Columbia University.     Upon moving home to El Paso, he launched a website development company with help from his father’s political network. He won a seat on the El Paso City Council in 2005, and in 2012 he ousted incumbent Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes in a Democratic primary.     When he launched his Senate campaign against Mr. Cruz, few in Washington or Texas gave Mr. O’Rourke much chance to make the race close. By the campaign’s end, Mr. O’Rourke’s aides were turning away requests from big-name Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, to come to Texas to join him on the stump.     In a Democratic presidential contest that features candidates such as Mr. Sanders, who have spent decades defining their political stances, Mr. O’Rourke enters the race without much of a defined ideology, a potential handicap given the party’s shift to the left.                                         Presidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows, but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains.                                                                                                     In his prior competitive races, for El Paso’s city council, for Congress and against Mr. Cruz in 2018, Mr. O’Rourke exceeded expectations by defining his opponent as out of touch with his constituents—a luxury he won’t have in the crowded Democratic primary.      In the four months since he lost to Mr. Cruz, Mr. O’Rourke has conducted his deliberations about running for president in public. He spent a week driving alone through the Southwest, chatted with Oprah Winfrey about his future prospects and interviewed fellow El Pasoans about life along the Mexican border, all without offering a definitive declaration about his future plans.      Mr. O’Rourke’s most defined policy priorities come on immigration—he not only opposes President Trump’s border wall but also said he would tear down existing fencing that separates El Paso from Mexico. He also has sharply criticized corporate influence on American politics and refused to accept political-action committee contributions in his Senate race.

On economic policy, Mr. O’Rourke sits in the center of the Democratic coalition. He is a free trader, unlike Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, and has said he could support an array of health-care proposals, ranging from a single-payer system to strengthening the Affordable Care Act.     Mr. O’Rourke became a national political phenomenon last year in part because of his ability to produce viral campaign moments that crossed over into popular culture.     A four-minute video of him defending professional football players’ decision to kneel during the national anthem during a campaign stop drew more than 44 million views online and became a flashpoint in his Senate race.     While his Senate campaign brought him closer to victory than any Texas Democrat running for statewide office in a generation, his many stops in the state’s rural counties didn’t result in electoral success there—his strongest support came from the state’s most populous regions.     A staple of Mr. O’Rourke’s stump speech was his visit to tiny King County, which in his telling hadn’t hosted a statewide political candidate since Lyndon Johnson was on the stump. On Election Day, King County went for Mr. Cruz by a margin of 124 to 6.     The Democratic field continues to grow. Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., announced he was launching a presidential exploratory committee Wednesday. In 2015, Mr. Messam became the first black mayor of the city of about 140,000 people northwest of Miami. He recently won re-election to another term.      —Ken Thomas contributed to this article.
