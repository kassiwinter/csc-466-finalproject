WASHINGTON—Republicans say they hope a meeting Monday of senators of both parties will avert a clash this week over President         Barack Obama's    executive-branch nominees that is threatening to poison relations in the Senate and slow progress on a range of legislation.But the Senate's Democratic leader, Sen.         Harry Reid,    gave no signal Sunday that he expected anything from the Monday meeting to dissuade him and other Democrats from moving forward on a plan to change Senate rules on nominations. "We're going to make a simple change," Mr. Reid said. Republicans have said they would retaliate for the rules change, meaning the arcane matter could have wide repercussions, potentially slowing business on legislation and other matters.                                                 Richard Cordray, nominee for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testifies at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on March 12.

Invoking a filibuster forces a nominee to win 60 votes in order to shut down the filibuster, a harder target than the 51 votes needed for confirmation. It is a tactic used most often by the Senate's minority party, currently the Republicans.               Democrats say that Republican filibuster threats have limited Mr. Obama's ability to govern. Mr. Reid has set up votes on seven presidential nominees for Tuesday, expecting that some will fail. Democrats might then change Senate rules on how to deal with executive-branch nominations.     "What we're doing is saying, 'Look, American people, shouldn't President Obama have somebody working for him that he wants?' " Mr. Reid said Sunday on NBC.     Senate Republicans say the rules change would strip them of an important power, and they hope lawmakers will back down during an uncommon, closed-door session of the full chamber on Monday evening called to discuss the matter.     "We have an opportunity to pull back from the brink in this joint meeting," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told NBC. He added that "I hope we'll come to our senses and not change the core of the Senate."           Hanging in the BalanceSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is seeking to advance the following nominations this week: Richard Cordray, director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Richard F. Griffin Jr., Sharon Block and Mark Gaston Pearce; National Labor Relations Board Fred Hochberg, president, Export- Import Bank of the United States Thomas Edward Perez, Secretary of Labor Regina McCarthy, administrator, Environmental Protection Agency           The rules change has been dubbed the "nuclear option" for the destruction it could cause. The Senate operates on consent from all 100 lawmakers for a wide variety of business, such as approving the previous day's journal, waiving the time-consuming process of reading pieces of legislation in full and allowing Senate committees to sit in the afternoon.      By withholding consent, Republicans could make it difficult to make progress on any business, without even voting directly against any pieces of legislation.      If the dispute drags on, it could complicate tasks that Congress must accomplish in the next few months, such as coming to agreement on funding levels for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 and on legislation to increase the federal government's statutory borrowing limit.     "If they go for the nuclear option, the gridlock is only going to get worse," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell.      Mr. Stewart declined to say specifically what the impact could be on the coming government spending and debt-ceiling debates expected this fall.      Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that even if Republicans are angry about the rule change being pushed by Mr. Reid, she doubted that they would try to block major legislative items.     "We haven't seen a government shut down since 1995, and we haven't seen the government default on its debt, because some outcomes are deemed to be unacceptable," said Ms. Binder. "Republicans don't want to get the blame for some of these things."     The votes Mr. Reid has scheduled for Tuesday will test the Senate's willingness to confirm nominees to the National Labor Relations Board and to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, the Labor Department, the Export-Import Bank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.     The Senate's top Democrat said that changes to the filibuster rules wouldn't apply to votes on legislation or to judicial appointments. "The changes we're making are very, very minimal," Mr. Reid said.     Mr. McConnell suggested that Mr. Reid was using a disagreement about a small number of nominees to push through sweeping changes. Many of Mr. Obama's second-term nominees have been approved and are now in their jobs.     "We're wondering why the majority leader is thinking about the nuclear trigger," Mr. McConnell said. "Why this threat to blow the Senate up when the president's getting his nominees?"     The dispute has raised questions over Mr. Obama's impending decisions on who should succeed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who announced her resignation Friday, and Elizabeth Duke, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who said last week she is leaving in August.     Mr. McConnell said on Sunday that he "can't guarantee there won't be a spirited debate" when the Senate considers the next nominee for the homeland security job.     —Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.
