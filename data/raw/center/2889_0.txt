WASHINGTON—Senate Republican leaders said Tuesday they would push ahead with a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act early next week even as GOP defections made it clear the effort would fail. The move from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) means Senate GOP leaders plan to hold a vote they expect to lose, an unusual move that may be designed to let the Senate quickly move on from the health debate after a turbulent monthslong effort to roll back the ACA. With a separate bloc of Republicans saying Monday night they wouldn’t support a broader health bill, that made two major GOP health efforts thwarted by internal party opposition in less than 24 hours.                Mr. McConnell said the decision to hold the vote next week was made at the request of President      Donald Trump        and Vice President      Mike Pence.        Mr. Trump said Tuesday he wanted Republicans to focus on winning more Senate seats in 2018, and a political-action committee said it would seek primary challenges against GOP senators who block that vote.     “As of today we just simply do not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing law,” Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. Three senators also said they would oppose the straight repeal measure, one more than what Mr. McConnell could afford to lose.          The impasse reflects the changing calculus for the GOP: Though the party made political hay by campaigning against and voting repeatedly to repeal the law while         Barack Obama    was president, now that Mr. Trump is in office and promising to sign the bill, the situation is politically fraught. Republicans had struggled for weeks to craft a bill that would preserve the ACA’s most popular elements while also curbing Medicaid spending and lowering insurance premiums.

About 20 million Americans have gained coverage under the ACA.     Of the 52 current GOP senators, 49 had voted for the 2015 repeal bill. But many senators made it clear that a repeal of the law known as Obamacare threatened to alarm their constituents and destabilize the insurance market.     “To just say, ‘Repeal and trust us—we’re going to fix it in a couple years,’ that’s not going to provide comfort to the anxiety that a lot of Alaskan families are feeling right now,” GOP Sen.         Lisa Murkowski    of Alaska told reporters. “There is enough chaos and uncertainty already.”     By midday Tuesday, GOP Sens.         Susan Collins    of Maine,         Shelley Moore Capito    of West Virginia and Ms. Murkowski all said they would oppose a procedural motion necessary to begin consideration of a repeal bill, depriving it of the support needed to advance. Mr. McConnell couldn’t lose more than two GOP votes at any point in the process.     Mr. Trump, who on Monday night had thrown his weight behind Mr. McConnell’s bid to hold a repeal-only vote, modified his approach Tuesday, saying the ACA, if untouched, would collapse under its own weight.     At a lunch in the White House, he said his plan was now “to let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we’re probably in that position where we’ll let Obamacare fail. We’re not going to own it.”     Democrats said the ACA insurance exchanges, while fragile in some states, weren’t headed for collapse. They also said the president was trying to undermine the health-care system rather than seeking bipartisan cooperation.     “He wants to throw up his hands rather than roll up his sleeves to work with us to solve the problem,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters. “We Democrats have held the door to bipartisanship open to our Republican colleagues for months. It’s time for the Republicans to walk through it.”                                         President Donald Trump on Tuesday reacted to failure in the Senate of the GOP health-care bill, saying that now he and Congress would “let Obamacare fail,” and that the blame for the collapse of the 2010 health law wouldn’t fall on him and the Republicans.

While the law has been viewed unfavorably by most Republican voters and donors, certain provisions, including a regulation that prevents insurers from charging more or refusing to cover patients with costly medical conditions, have proved popular. Many GOP governors also have welcomed the law’s expanded Medicaid funding for their states.     Some conservatives who had criticized the Senate-crafted bill for not doing enough to undo the ACA applauded Mr. McConnell’s pivot to call for a vote on a straight repeal.     “Those Republicans who promised to repeal Obamacare ought to vote the same way they voted in 2015,” Sen.         Rand Paul    (R., Ky.) said. “If you’re not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015, then you need to go back home and you need to explain to Republicans why you’re no longer for repealing Obamacare.”     Other Republicans said that path would be irresponsible and generate anxiety for both the markets and their constituents. “I did not come to Washington to hurt people,” Ms. Capito said in a statement. “I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.”     Ms. Capito and Ms. Murkowski both voted for the 2015 repeal bill; Ms. Collins voted against it.

Republicans grappled Tuesday with the increasing likelihood that they would be unable to pass substantive legislation overhauling the ACA without Democratic support. GOP leaders have warned their rank-and-file that taking no action on health care could end up being a political liability and open the party to criticism for failing to fulfill a longstanding promise despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.     “You’ll see real anger,” said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that focuses on fiscal and tax issues. “I think the Republican Party has huge problems if they don’t repeal Obamacare. They have a huge integrity problem.”     From the beginning of Mr. Trump’s tenure, GOP leaders faced a core challenge: Any replacement health plan that satisfied GOP conservatives was likely to be opposed by the party’s centrists, and vice versa.     It’s a challenge they haven’t overcome. Mr. McConnell abandoned the Senate GOP health bill Monday night when defections by GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas left him short of the votes needed for passage, after Ms. Collins and Mr. Paul had already said they would vote no.     Turning to a repeal bill was plan B.     —Siobhan Hughes, Louise Radnofsky, Stephanie Armour and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
