Arberg said.      Justice Ginsburg, 85 years old, missed five oral arguments this week; six more are scheduled for next week. After that, the court won’t hear more cases again until Feb. 19, a break that will give the justice several more weeks for recuperation.      Nominated by President Clinton in 1993, Justice Ginsburg is a prominent member of the court’s liberal minority, and the court’s eldest member.               Last month she underwent a surgical procedure at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City to remove two cancerous growths on her left lung, which were discovered during routine treatment after a November fall that left the justice with cracked ribs. She was discharged on Christmas Day.     “Post-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required,” Ms. Arberg said Friday.     In addition to not attending oral arguments, Justice Ginsburg hasn’t been at the private meetings where the justices vote on cases. Following court practice when justices are absent, she has been voting by proxy.     After one of those meetings Friday, the court announced it was adding eight cases to its docket, though none of them were particularly high-profile. The new cases include one about which wage-and-hour laws apply to offshore oil-drilling platforms, and another that asks whether police officers need a warrant to take blood samples from suspected drunk drivers who are unconscious.     The court could announce next week whether it plans to review some looming blockbuster cases, including one examining President Trump’s decision to cancel the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that provided benefits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The program remains in effect after lower courts blocked its cancellation.     —Jess Bravin contributed to this article.
