Bernie Sanders is fighting to oust two Hillary Clinton supporters heading key Democratic National Convention committees, despite the party’s refusal to remove them, in the latest sign of disunity amid a bitter fight for the presidential nomination.An attorney for Mr. Sanders’s campaign sent a letter to Democratic National Committee officials on Friday asking them to disqualify former congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who are co-chairmen of the convention’s rules and platform committees, respectively. Brad Deutsch, counsel to the Sanders campaign, wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy are loyal Clinton allies who can’t be relied on to run their committees dispassionately. He asked that they be removed from their positions or, alternatively, that the DNC conduct a hearing that would assess their fitness to serve.         More Campaign News                On Saturday, however, the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee’s co-chairs sent a reply dismissing the complaint. They wrote that Messrs. Frank and Malloy had been elected by the DNC’s executive committee in January. No party rules were violated in that election, meaning there was no cause to strip the two men of their titles, their letter said.                After the DNC committee announced it’s rejection of the complaint and said it was retaining Messrs. Frank and Malloy, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said: “This doesn’t settle anything. We will raise the same serious issues when the committees convene” at the convention.     In his letter, Mr. Deutsch cited news accounts in which both Messrs. Frank and Malloy criticized Mr. Sanders and depicted him as the inferior candidate. One newspaper article cited in the letter included a remark critical of Mr. Sanders that Mr. Frank made in 1991, when Mr. Sanders was a freshman congressman from Vermont.

Malloy and Mr. Frank have been harsh, vocal critics of Sen. Sanders and equally active supporters of his challenger, Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Deutsch wrote.     He added: “Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign. The chairs therefore cannot be relied upon to perform their convention duties fairly and capably while laboring under such deeply held bias.”     Mr. Sanders has conceded he faces a difficult path to the nomination. With so-called superdelegates added to the mix, Mrs. Clinton leads by 2,310 delegates to 1,542. A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination.     Apart from closing the gap and wresting the nomination from Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders wants an influential role at the convention. He hopes to shape the party platform so it reflects some of his policy goals, including a $15 minimum wage and a single-payer, government-run health-care system. And he wants to adopt changes that would limit the power of superdelegates and open up future presidential nominating contests to more voters.                                                 Mr. Sanders also wants to remove Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, pictured on the left in April, from an important convention committee post.

Should there be any issue before the committee that bears on Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders becoming the nominee, Mr. Frank said he would recuse himself.     Mr. Frank noted that in the 2000s, he traveled to Burlington, Vermont at Mr. Sanders’s request and took part in a fundraising event for his then-congressional colleague.     Still, he made clear he isn’t impressed with Mr. Sanders’s record in the House and Senate. “We believe that Sen. Sanders’s approach to how you bring about progressive change is mistaken,” Mr. Frank said. “He’s arguing in part that he will be a more effective change agent and that’s relevant. The fact is that he has not been a very effective change agent in 25 years in Congress, and that seems to be relevant to voters in deciding who to support.”                  “What troubles me is that he and some of his people are trying to build a story that when he doesn’t get the nomination that he was somehow unfairly deprived of it.”                — Barney Frank, talking about Bernie Sanders’s complaints to the Democratic National Committee             A larger concern, Mr. Frank added, is that Mr. Sanders, by arguing the convention committees are tilted in Mrs. Clinton’s favor, is unfairly feeding perceptions that he is being robbed of the nomination.     To the extent that his supporters buy that argument, it could be tougher for Democrats to unify the party in advance of the showdown with the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.     “What troubles me is that he and some of his people are trying to build a story that when he doesn’t get the nomination that he was somehow unfairly deprived of it,” Mr. Frank said. “It’s nonsense. She’s got more pledged delegates, she’s won more contests and she has millions of more votes.”     A spokesman for Mr. Malloy also couldn’t be reached.
