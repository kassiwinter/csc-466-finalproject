Weisselberg surrendered to authorities in the early morning.An indictment of the Trump Organization could undermine the company's relationships with banks and business partners, and complicate Trump's political future as the Republican contemplates running again for president in 2024.Cyrus Vance, the district attorney, began his investigation nearly three years ago, and has been working in recent months with the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James on the still-ongoing probe. Vance and James are Democrats.COMPANY SAYS 'THIS IS POLITICS'In a statement, the Trump Organization said prosecutors were using Weisselberg, who has worked for the Trump family business for 48 years, as "a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president."The company also called Vance's case one that neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any other district attorney would ever bring."This is not justice; this is politics," the company said.Trump is not expected to be charged this week, his lawyer Ronald Fischetti has said.Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg looks on as then-U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., May 31, 2016.

That cooperation could become crucial to any future case against his longtime boss.The Trump Organization operates hotels, golf courses, and resorts around the world.Before entering the White House in January 2017, Trump put his company into a trust overseen by his adult sons and Weisselberg, who has maintained tight control over company finances. It is unclear what role Trump now has at the company.Court filings, public records and subpoenaed documents show that Weisselberg and his son Barry have received perks and gifts potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including many benefits related to real estate.The case could be charged as a scheme by the company to pay people off the books in order to hide assets over many years.Vance has examined an array of potential wrongdoing, including whether Trump's company manipulated the value of its real estate to reduce its taxes and secure favorable loan terms.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Karen Freifeld, Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Julia Harte, Joseph Tanfani and Jan Wolfe in Washington, D.C.; and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Peter Graff and Daniel WallisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
