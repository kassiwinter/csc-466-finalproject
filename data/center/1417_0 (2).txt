Those closest to the Mediterranean coast seem to have been hit largely by Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from warships - this is an area where Syrian government air defences may still have coverage. In a briefing Lt Gen William Mayville noted that Syrian air defences were "passive", as he put it, during the course of the operation. This suggests a conscious decision by Syrian commanders who perhaps feared that active scanning by their defences might draw down air attacks upon them. The operation was notable for involving aircraft from Jordan and from Washington's Gulf allies. It also marked the first use in combat of one of the USAF's most modern aircraft, the F-22 Raptor. This, the Pentagon is stressing, is just the start of "a sustained air campaign", the tempo of which, says a Pentagon spokesman, "will be dictated by facts on the ground".Image source, AFPImage caption, Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from the USS Arleigh Burke in the Red SeaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The US military said a total of 14 air strikes were carried out in several areas in the north and east of SyriaSyrian President Bashar al-Assad, quoted by state media, said he supports any international efforts to combat "terrorism" in Syria.Analysts say it is significant that countries with a Sunni majority, like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, are among those supporting US efforts against IS.IS members are jihadists who adhere to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and consider themselves the only true believers.
