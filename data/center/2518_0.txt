GETTYSBURG, Pa.—      Donald Trump,        trying to jump-start his struggling campaign heading in the election’s home stretch, Saturday traveled to a storied Civil War battlefield to frame his closing argument to voters to upend the nation’s political status quo.He set a newly serious tone, but returned to his complaints about the “rigged” political system. His agenda for his first 100 days echoed proposals he has been touting on the campaign trail for months—tax cuts, a crackdown on illegal immigration and renegotiation of trade deals. Mr. Trump for the first time threatened to sue the women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward them. He also said he would not approve a proposed deal for         AT&T    to buy       Time Warner Inc     for more than $80 billion, and said he’d like to break up the         Comcast    and NBCUniversal merger.        
More Election 2016 Coverage        That was a new element in his broader attack on the news media and others he believes are undermining the middle class.               “Change has to come from outside our very broken system,” he said, speaking to a small, invitation-only audience in a hotel conference center. “The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime.”     The speech comes at a particularly tumultuous time for the Trump campaign. For weeks he has been buffeted by accusations from women who say he had made unwanted sexual advances, revelations that emerged after a 2005 video surfaced showing him bragging about using his celebrity to force himself on women.     He hasn’t mentioned the controversy in the last several rallies, as the campaign tries to put the issue behind him. But he returned to it in the middle of the policy speech, saying all of the women who accused him of making inappropriate advances “lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.     “All of these liars will be sued after the election is over,” he said.     He also threatened to file suit over political operatives he said planted protesters in his rallies to stir trouble, and accused the Democratic National Committee and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee         Hillary Clinton    of being behind the effort. “But we’ll find out about their involvement at a later date through litigation. And I look forward to doing that.”     Despite those jabs, Mr. Trump’s speech was in a very different setting and struck a different, more sober tone than his raucous rallies.     His campaign billed it as a major address that would include new policies. It had only a few minor new details, such as a promise to cancel payments to the United Nations on programs related to climate change and more specificity on punishment for illegal immigrants who, once deported, return to the U.S.     While Mr. Lincoln led the nation in a war to end slavery and keep the nation unified, Mr. Trump has been under fire throughout the campaign for divisive rhetoric. He has been trying to counter those criticisms by saying he wants to improve life in U.S. inner cities for African-Americans and Latinos, but polls show he still trails Mrs. Clinton badly in those voting blocks.     While he spoke of uniting the party, the speech came amid signs a rift is widening between his campaign and House Speaker         Paul Ryan,    who has said he would no longer defend or campaign with Mr. Trump and who is promoting a more conventionally conservative policy agenda.     Mr. Trump last week escalated the conflict by suggesting Mr. Ryan wanted him to lose because he wanted to run for president in 2020. “Maybe he wants to run in four years,” he said in an interview broadcast Tuesday in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin.     The Trump-Ryan feud widened Saturday when an article attacking Mr. Ryan appeared on the conservative website Breitbart.com, which was run by top Trump aide Steve Bannon before he joined the campaign. The article accused him of trying to sabotage the Trump campaign and of being in league with Mrs. Clinton on key “globalist” policies.      Ryan spokesman Zack Roday responded, “This is utter crazy talk. Speaker Ryan’s focus is on beating Democrats, including Secretary Clinton. His efforts will help all Republicans.”     Gettysburg is the site of the watershed Civil War battle and President Abraham Lincoln’s address dedicating a cemetery for fallen soldiers.     Over the last week, Mr. Trump has been dropping some new proposals into his rally speeches—such as term limits and cutting some regulations–but the Gettysburg speech was the most ambitious effort yet to turn attention away from character questions to policy.      On his first day in office he said he would propose term limits on members of Congress, a hiring freeze at some federal agencies, new limits on lobbying by former government officials, and new limits on regulations by requiring that for every new federal rule issued, two existing regulations be eliminated.     He said he would immediately begin implementing his trade agenda by announcing plans to renegotiate Nafta, withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and ask the Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. He would suspend immigration from nations he considers “terror prone” and begin deporting criminal illegal immigrants.     His first-100-days legislative agenda would include repealing the Obamacare health law, tax cuts and his immigration plan. Some new details provided for that illegal immigration crackdown were mandatory minimum prison sentences for those illegally re-entering the U.S. after deportation.     The bottom line he tried to convey was an antiestablishment message that he said was in sync with Lincoln’s message in his 1863 Gettysburg Address.     “Hillary Clinton is not running against me. She is running against change,” he said, to an audience and in a setting far different from his signature rallies. It was a crowd of hundreds, not thousands, seated on chairs in an auditorium rather than standing packed in vast hangars or fairgrounds.     “We will drain the swamp in Washington, D.C., and replace it with a new government of, by and for the people,” he said. “That is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract.”     Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
