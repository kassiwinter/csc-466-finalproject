Texas officials have previously cited Trump's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in their opposition to expanding voting access.On Thursday afternoon, Abbott responded to lawsuit in a tweet, saying "Bring it. The Texas election integrity law is legal. It INCREASES hours to vote. It does restrict illegal mail ballot voting. Only those who qualify can vote by mail. It also makes ballot harvesting a felony. In Texas it is easier to vote but harder to cheat."BIDEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENTThis is now the second time that the Biden Justice Department has sued a state over voting rights.Earlier this year, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the department was filing a lawsuit against the state of Georgia after it enacted a new election law that the Justice Department said infringes on the rights of Black voters.Georgia has asked a judge to dismiss that lawsuit, saying in a court filing that it was "not a serious legal challenge but a politically motivated effort to usurp the constitutional authority of Georgiaâ€™s elected officials to regulate elections."This marks the third legal challenge by the Justice Department to Texas state laws and executive orders since Biden took office in January.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court heard oralarguments after the department sued Texas over its near-total ban on abortions.In the summer, the department also sued Texas to block an executive order aimed at curbing the travel into the state of undocumented immigrants who may pose a risk of transmitting COVID-19.In August, a judge issued a preliminary ruling in favor of the Biden administration, saying Abbott's executive order "conflicts with, and poses an obstacle to, federal immigration law."Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Sarah N.
