One official familiar with her confirmation efforts said the White House has emphasized the historic nature of her nomination and argued that Tanden’s difficult upbringing and government experience make her especially qualified for the role.The White House has also highlighted Haaland’s historic nomination and her strong relationships with tribal groups, her familiarity with small-business owners and her bipartisan relationships, the official said.Haaland’s path forward was closely watched as Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) carry in such a narrowly divided chamber, where one Democratic defection could derail a Cabinet nominee.Becerra had met with at least 40 senators as of Monday, including members of both parties, the official said. The case for Becerra’s confirmation has centered around his work on health policy while in Congress and his managerial experience as California attorney general, where he focused on protecting consumers and patients from corporate abuses of power and defending the Affordable Care Act in court.If confirmed, Becerra would be the first Latino secretary of Health and Human Services at a time when people of color are disproportionately getting sick and dying of COVID-19.Conservative groups have run ads questioning his experience for the role and urging senators to oppose his nomination. Becerra filed more than 100 lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s regulations on health care, the environment and immigration, making him a target for pro-Trump lawmakers, especially those who hope to run for president in a few years.Some supporters of the nominees have suggested that racism or sexism may be playing a role in opposition to the nominations.“Let me say this, both Attorney General Becerra and I, throughout our careers, have been the only Latino in the room,” said Sen.

The Trump administration’s delay of the transition in November also impacted the confirmation process, Biden officials say.The pace of confirmations has fallen behind that of former Presidents Trump, Obama and George W. Bush.Some of Biden’s early nominees received considerable bipartisan support, and Democrats are pushing to quickly confirm more officials this week.
