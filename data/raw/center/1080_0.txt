         Bari Weiss,    a high-profile editor and writer for the         New York Times        NYT 1.41%       opinion section, resigned Monday, citing what she said was unchecked bullying from colleagues and depicting the news organization as a place where the free exchange of ideas was no longer welcome.In a letter to New York Times publisher         A.G. Sulzberger    which was posted on her website Tuesday, Ms. Weiss wrote that she has been “the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views.” “We’re committed to fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue between colleagues, one where mutual respect is required of all,” Times spokeswoman         Eileen Murphy    said Tuesday.     The company declined to comment on many of the specifics of Ms. Weiss’s resignation letter.               Ms. Weiss also described the Times’s opinion section as a place where intellectual curiosity had become a liability. “Why edit something challenging to our readers, or write something bold only to go through the numbing process of making it ideologically kosher, when we can assure ourselves of job security (and clicks) by publishing our 4000th op-ed arguing that Donald Trump is a unique danger to the country and the world?” she wrote.     The Times’s opinion section came under fire last month for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) that called for the U.S. government to deploy military troops to deter looting amid protests sparked by the May 25 killing of         George Floyd    while in police custody in Minneapolis. The piece was criticized by many New York Times reporters and editors, who said it endangered their Black colleagues covering the protests and contained factual errors.              James Bennet,    the Times’s editorial-page chief, resigned shortly afterward, and his deputy, James Dao, was removed from the company’s masthead and reassigned to the newsroom.     A few days before Mr. Bennet’s resignation, Ms. Weiss wrote on         Twitter    that a “civil war” had engulfed the Times newsroom between an older guard that supported civil libertarianism and a “woke” new guard that felt that the comfort and safety of the individual trumped core liberal values.          “Here’s one way to think about what’s at stake: The New York Times motto is ‘all the news that’s fit to print.’ One group emphasizes the word ‘all.’ The other, the word ‘fit,’” she wrote on June 4.     The argument elicited widespread public criticism from many of her colleagues, calling her interpretation misguided.     Other newsrooms have been facing staff protests concerning such issues as racial accountability, including Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Washington Post.     In her resignation letter, Ms. Weiss wrote she felt the New York Times hadn’t learned the lessons of the 2016 presidential election, including “the importance of understanding other Americans.” Instead, she wrote, “Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor.”     In a statement, Kathleen Kingsbury, acting editorial-page editor for the Times, said: “We appreciate the many contributions that Bari made to Times Opinion. I’m personally committed to ensuring that The Times continues to publish voices, experiences and viewpoints from across the political spectrum in the Opinion report.”     Separately,         Andrew Sullivan    tweeted Tuesday that this would be his last week at New York magazine as writer-at-large. Mr. Sullivan wrote that “I’ll be discussing the broader questions involved in my last column this Friday.” Mr. Sullivan joined New York magazine in 2016.     Similarly to Ms. Weiss, Mr. Sullivan has been at the center of controversy for writing critically of what he argues is the curtailing of free speech on campuses and beyond and what he describes as a hardening ideological orthodoxy taking hold in academia, at corporations and in civic society.     In a note sent to New York’s staff on Tuesday, editor in chief David Haskell wrote that the “decision to part ways was mutual.” Mr. Sullivan couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.     Ms. Weiss has long been an outspoken critic of cancel culture—what critics describe as censorship attempts against ideas that stray from liberal orthodoxy—and has written about the #MeToo movement and foreign affairs.     Ms. Weiss, who joined the Times in 2017 after serving as an associate books editor at the Journal, also wrote that her character had been attacked on companywide Slack channels. Other staffers, she added, referred to her as a “liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action.”     Ms. Weiss didn’t explicitly threaten legal action, but she wrote that the treatment she had received fell under the rubric of “unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment.” Vice News earlier reported her departure.     Ms. Weiss, 36 years old, declined to elaborate, saying “the letter speaks for itself.”     Write to Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg at jeffrey.trachtenberg@wsj.com and Lukas I.
