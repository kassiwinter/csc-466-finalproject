      	A federal judge in Manhattan landed another blow to the Trump administration’s immigration policies Friday, blocking efforts to punish cities for protecting immigrants from the feds by blocking grants to local law enforcement.
The decision handed down by Judge Edgardo Ramos said the effort was unconstitutional because it violated the 10th Amendment and its separation-of-powers requirements.
The judge also determined the policy was “arbitrary and capricious.”
“As we argued, local law enforcement has the right to decide how to meet their local public safety needs — and the Trump administration simply does not have the right to require state and local police to act as federal immigration agents,” New York state Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s attempt to withhold these vital funds was nothing more than a political attack at the expense of our public safety.”
New York was supposed to receive nearly $9 million from the grant program in 2017.
But the money was withheld after local officials refused to cooperate with new federal immigration policing requirements. Nearly half of that money would have flowed to New York City.
Underwood and five other AGs filed suit in July, challenging the policy.
It’s the latest in a series of federal rulings against President Trump’s controversial immigration policies.
A federal appeals court in California ruled earlier this month that Trump must continue a program that protects children brought to the US by their parents, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
A separate federal court in San Francisco last week also blocked Trump’s efforts to deny asylum to immigrants crossing the southern border illegally.
