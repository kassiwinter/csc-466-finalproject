         Rep. Kyrsten Sinema    won Arizona’s U.S. Senate contest, becoming the state’s first Democrat in 30 years to win election to the chamber.The Associated Press on Monday declared Ms. Sinema the winner over Republican         Rep. Martha McSally    following a tight race that took about a week to produce a winner. Ms. McSally conceded defeat. With Ms. Sinema’s victory, the Democrats have now flipped two Senate seats and the Republicans three, with the Florida Senate race still outstanding and a Nov. 27 runoff election still to come in Mississippi. Ms. Sinema won by more than 38,000 votes, or about 1.7 percentage points.

Jeff Flake, who didn’t seek a second term after his re-election prospects dimmed amid public clashes with President Trump.          As the final ballots are tallied in the still-uncalled House races across the nation, Democrats have a net gain of 32 House seats and have a chance at picking up as many as 38, according to unofficial counts.     The Associated Press has yet to call the winners in 10 closely watched House races, which are expected to split evenly between the two parties. Democrats have already flipped 35 Republican districts, and GOP candidates captured three Democratic seats.     Ms. Sinema, 42 years old, campaigned as a conservative Democrat after beginning her political career as a firebrand liberal employed by Ralph Nader’s 2000 Green Party presidential campaign. The three-term House member with a centrist voting record faced only token primary opposition even though she wasn’t beloved by her party’s progressive base.     Ms. Sinema survived a bruising contest in which Ms. McSally accused her of being a traitor after their lone debate and Ms. McSally’s allies unearthed reams of footage of Ms. Sinema voicing her past opinions, some of which are out of step with the more moderate political persona she has groomed in recent years.          Arizona last elected a Democratic senator in 1988, and in presidential contests has voted for the Republican candidate every year since 1952, with the exception of Democrat         Bill Clinton    in 1996. Mr. Trump won the state by a margin of 49% to 45.5% over         Hillary Clinton    in 2016.     Ms. Sinema will become the first openly bisexual member of the U.S. Senate when she takes office in January. When she was first elected to Congress in 2012, she was the first member to list her religion as “none.”     Among the uncalled House races, three are in California, where it may still be weeks before election officials finalize their results. In the California 10th District, Democrat Josh Harder has taken the lead against incumbent Republican Rep. Jeff Denham. Republicans Young Kim and         Mimi Walters    have held on to slim leads in the California 39th and 45th, respectively.     Republicans enjoy slight leads in three of the other uncalled races, in the Texas 23rd, Georgia Seventh and the New York 27th congressional districts.     Newsletter Sign-up Politics Alert Major political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.               Rep. Will Hurd    (R., Texas), Rep. Rob Woodall (R., Ga.) and         Rep. Chris Collins    (R., N.Y.), who was indicted on insider-trading charges this year, are on track to return to Congress. Mr. Woodall’s Democratic opponent, Carolyn Bourdeaux, has taken legal action challenging how election officials have counted absentee ballots.     In the Utah 4th, New York 22nd and New Jersey Third, Democrats appear likely to flip more Republican-held seats.     And a contested race in Maine’s Second District has proceeded to an unusual ranked-choice recount, when election officials will count the second and third choices of voters who supported independent candidates not in the top two. That contest also leans toward the Democrat, Jared Golden, over Republican incumbent         Rep. Bruce Poliquin.         Write to Reid J.
