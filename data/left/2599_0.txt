2016-12-22T03:30-0500  In the 1890s, President Benjamin Harrison became the first U.S. president (that we know of) to dress up as Santa Claus. Realizing that his sizable beard worked to his advantage, he would put on a Santa suit at Christmastime to entertain his grandchildren. He is also credited with bringing the first Christmas tree into the White House.It wasn't until the early 20th century that White House Christmases went from relatively private affairs to elaborate celebrations, marked by public ceremonies and official events taking place over several weeks. And, the decorations! This year, more than 100 years after Harrison brought in the first tree, the White House is decked out with 63 trees, 70,000 ornaments and 56 gingerbread houses.One thing is for certain: If there's a war on Christmas, the White House is definitely winning it. Here, for your holiday perusal, are photos of presidents past and present celebrating the yuletide, both in public and private.

Harrison's successor, Grover Cleveland, didn't dress up as Santa. But otherwise he embraced the tradition Harrison started and in 1894, he decorated the first family's tree, pictured above, with red, white and blue electric lights. This was considered remarkable, as very few households at the time had access to electricity.  2016-12-19T02:37-0500

On December 21, 1970, the King of Rock and Roll came to the White House bearing a Christmas gift for President Richard Nixon. Unfortunately, the Secret Service confiscated the Colt .45 and its display case before Presley could present it. But the meeting went well otherwise. When Presley, who collected police badges, asked the president if he could have a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Nixon asked an aide in the room, "Can we get him a badge?" The aide said they could, and Nixon gave the OK. Elvis was so excited, he immediately hugged the president. The King walked out of the White House with his narco badge in hand, believing he could use it to legally bring drugs into any country he wished.  2016-12-19T02:27-0500
