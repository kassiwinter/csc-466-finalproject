                 | January 10, 2021 02:21 PM                 | Updated Jan 10, 2021, 03:14 PM                In the wake of the violent attack on Capitol Hill last week, at least three corporations have announced that they would suspend contributions to the campaigns of lawmakers who objected to the certification of Electoral College votes.      At least four protests were scheduled in Washington, D.C., for Wednesday, the day Congress was expected to count the votes of the Electoral College and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Those protests descended into chaos as demonstrators breached the congressional building — smashing windows, breaking into offices, and looting rooms.             Before the demonstrations turned violent, a number of lawmakers expressed support for the protests. After the Capitol was secured, 147 Republican lawmakers, 139 representatives and eight senators, cast their vote objecting to the certification of Electoral College votes that sent President-elect Joe Biden to the White House.       Now, Marriott International, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Commerce Bancshares, who donated to at least one of the nearly 150 lawmakers who objected, all said they are suspending their donations "to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy," according to Popular Information, a political newsletter that polled more than 140 companies which made contributions in the 2020 election cycle.       Blue Cross Blue Shield, which donated more than $10,000 to Sens. Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, and Josh Hawley in 2020, said that the "shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election," compelled the company to cease contributions to those politicians, adding that the company would "continue to support lawmakers and candidates in both political parties who will work with us to build a stronger, healthier nation."       Marriott, which donated $2,000 last year to funds connected to Hawley, said it was "pausing political giving" to candidates who objected. Marriott historically favored Republican lawmakers but, since 2010, has split political contributions evenly across party lines.       Commerce Bank said its employee-funded political action committee has "suspended all support for officials who have impeded the peaceful transfer of power." Commerce Bank's PAC contributed $2,500 to Marshall in 2020.       After Popular Information's story was published, CitiBank also said that it would "pause contributions" to GOP members who objected and will "not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law."                      UPDATE: @Citibank says it will “not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law” and will “pause contributions" to the GOP members who objected.It is the fourth major corporation to take such a step. https://t.co/r4Z4TjJUCe— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) January 10, 2021
