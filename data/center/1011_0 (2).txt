WASHINGTON—The Senate's top Democrat and Republican opened negotiations on Saturday aimed at avoiding a U.S. debt crisis and reopening the government, marking a new chapter and new urgency in efforts to resolve the political stalemate in Congress.The talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) and Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.) were their first face-to-face negotiations since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, and showed a changed dynamic in the Capitol. House Republicans, a dominant force in budget battles, have been sidelined after withdrawing many of their policy demands, only to see President         Barack Obama    reject their proposal for ending the impasse.                                                 House Speaker John Boehner, shown with Rep. David Schweikert (R., Ariz.), met with fellow Republicans Saturday in a closed-door meeting.          Associated Press                                                                                                                   
Budget Battle           Instead, the focus has turned to the Senate, where members of both parties had started talks in recent days on a compromise proposal, before discussions were elevated to Messrs. Reid and McConnell on Saturday.     "The real conversation that matters now is the one that's taking place between McConnell and Reid," said Sen.         Bob Corker    (R., Tenn.).               The two Senate leaders met around 9 a.m. on Saturday for about 45 minutes, along with Sens.         Charles Schumer    (D., N.Y.) and         Lamar Alexander    (R., Tenn.). Mr. Reid said Mr. Alexander called him on Friday night to initiate the talks at Mr. McConnell's request.     "This should be seen as something very positive, even though we don't have anything done yet and a long ways to go before anything like that will happen," Mr. Reid said Saturday afternoon.      Senate Democratic leaders met for about an hour and a half with the president and his top aides to discuss strategy for the negotiations. Also attending the meeting were White House Chief of Staff         Denis McDonough,    deputy staff chief         Rob Nabors,    and Sylvia Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget.     The talks came against a backdrop of rising public frustration with the partial government shutdown, now in its 12th day, and market anxiety about the prospect of a U.S. debt default. The Treasury says that by Thursday it will have exhausted emergency measures and be left with only about $30 billion to pay the nation's bills, which could run out in a week or two.     Senate leaders gave no firm deadline to reach a deal, but said they hoped to resolve the situation over the next two days. They made clear they were aware that the uncertainty shrouding the debt ceiling could worry investors when the market reopens Monday.     "We don't know when the market will react to this," Mr. Schumer said.     Senate leaders were still working Saturday to reach an agreement on the biggest questions underpinning any deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, aides said. Lawmakers must decide how long to reopen the government and at what spending level, as well as how long to extend the country's borrowing limit.      Democrats don't want to agree to a plan that keeps the government running for an extended period that locks in a set of across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, Mr. Schumer said.     Any deal that the Senate settles on is sure to present a quandary to conservative House Republicans: It is likely to fall short of the policy demands they have been seeking, but will likely arrive shortly before Oct. 17, leaving little time for further negotiations.     In the Senate, Democratic leaders rejected a proposal from one of the chamber's least-conservative Republicans, Sen.         Susan Collins    of Maine, that had appeared to be gaining momentum, drawing interest from some Democratic senators.     The Collins plan called for extending the nation's borrowing authority through January and opening the government through March. But the measure would have done nothing to undo the sequester, a top Democratic priority. It also would have repealed a tax on medical devices imposed under the 2010 federal health law, a proposition Republicans favor but many Democrats don't.     After Democrats on Saturday rejected the Collins plan, attention shifted to the bipartisan negotiations between the top party leaders.     "What I hope is that Sen. McConnell and Sen. Reid will work together to come up with a way for us to open the government and pay our bills and reduce our debt," said Mr. Alexander. "If they can do that over the next few hours, the country will be better off."     Many House lawmakers have left Washington for the weekend, a further indication that the Senate was building the likeliest avenue toward a resolution. They return for votes on Monday evening.     Conservative lawmakers were already bracing Saturday for a Senate proposal they would find disappointing, if not unacceptable. To many, the Collins plan was insufficiently conservative, and the talks between Messrs. Reid and McConnell seemed likely to move it further toward Democratic policy goals.     When House Republicans heard details of the Collins proposal in Saturday's meeting, there were "a lot of nods of agreement and understanding that this is a bad idea," said Rep.         John Fleming    (R., La.). "It's a nonstarter with us. We'd never go along with that."     Also Saturday, a bill to extend the country's borrowing limit through the end of 2014 failed in the Senate on a procedural vote that fell along partisan lines. Republicans were unlikely to back the measure while their top party leaders were in negotiations on the debt ceiling, and no GOP senators voted for it.     The measure to raise the debt ceiling, which included no other policy proposals, fell short of securing the 60 votes required to open debate on it, failing to advance on a 53-45 vote. Mr. Reid voted against the measure for procedural reasons, which leaves the option of bringing the measure to the Senate floor in the future.     House Republicans learned on Saturday that Mr. Obama had rejected their proposal for ending the stalemate. They painted a far more negative picture of the state of their talks with the White House than had emerged on Friday, when the White House had said Mr. Obama "had some concerns'' about the plan but that the two sides would keep talking.     On Saturday, GOP lawmakers and aides said Mr. Obama had essentially rejected everything offered by House Republicans in their proposal.     "I am disappointed the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table," said House Majority Leader         Eric Cantor    (R., Va.). He added: "He's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice."     House Republicans had told Mr. Obama on Thursday that they were willing to extend the nation's borrowing authority for six weeks and begin talks to reopen the government in exchange for the start of negotiations on broader fiscal issues in which the GOP would press for a range of deficit-reduction steps and changes to the health-care law, according to a House GOP aide.      That proposal marked a major concession from House Republicans, who only weeks ago had been aiming to use the political stalemate as leverage to undermine Mr. Obama's signature legislative achievement, the 2010 health-care law. They also appeared to step back from a demand that any increase in the debt ceiling be paired with deficit-cutting measures.     On Saturday, some House Republicans said they still wanted any agreement to include changes to the 2010 health law, a top priority that had given way among Republicans in recent days in favor of attempts to win deficit-reduction measures.     They were disappointed that Senate Republicans were considering funding the government through March, rather than for a shorter period.     "It's a huge cave," said Rep.         Patrick McHenry    (R., N.C.). Reopening the government for six months would remove "the forced element of negotiations, and allows most of the Obamacare provisions to go into effect without us having any ability to negotiate," he said.     Federal agencies were forced to suspend many activities and place hundreds of thousands of workers on furlough on Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund the government.     Public frustration with the stalemate has been high, opinion polls show, and markets are wary. The Treasury says lawmakers must lift the debt ceiling this month, or it will be unable to pay all the nation's bills. A landmark comes on Thursday, the date by which the Treasury says it will have exhausted emergency measures and be left with only about $30 billion to pay bills, which could run out in a week or two.
