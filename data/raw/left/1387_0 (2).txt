British prime minister David Cameron said he would take "whatever steps are necessary" to bring the "fanatical" killers of a British aid worker to justice. A new video from the Islamic State (IS) militant group was released on Sunday showing a masked militant beheading 44-year-old David Haines.Mr Haines, a father of two originally from Perth in Scotland, was kidnapped last year while working for the French agency ACTED in Syria.Mr Cameron earlier called an emergency committee meeting to discuss the government's response to the killing, and the threat to a second British hostage by IS extremists."We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes," Mr Cameron said after the meeting."We are a peaceful people. We do not seek out confrontation but we cannot ignore this threat to our security and that of our allies."Describing Mr Haines as a "British hero", he said the IS militants were "not Muslims, they are monsters"."We cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe. We have to confront this menace," he said."Step-by-step, we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (Islamic State) and what it stands for."He said Britain would work closely with allies to defeat IS through a "comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy"."This is not something that we can do on our own, we have to work with the rest of the world," he said."But ultimately our security as a nation, the way we go about our everyday lives in this free and tolerant society that is Britain, has always depended on our readiness to act against those who stand for hatred and who stand for destruction."And that is exactly what we will do."Militant threatens second British hostage In the video, Mr Haines denounced Mr Cameron for working with the United States against IS."Following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans," he said."Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions."Murdered US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff made similar speeches addressing US president Barack Obama, which have been dismissed as scripted by IS.The militant in the video told Britain the alliance will "accelerate your destruction" and will drag the British people into "another bloody and unwinnable war".He also threatened to execute another British hostage.A day before the video's release, the Haines family appealed to David's captors to contact them.In a statement, Mr Haines's brother Mike remembered a man who was "most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles".He said his brother "was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly"."He was, in the right mood, the life and soul of the party and on other times the most stubborn irritating pain in the ass. He would probably say the same about me."Mike Haines appeared in a video statement on Sunday speaking out against religious radicalisation. "We are seeing more and more radicalisation in every walk of life. It is not a race, religion or political issue, it is a human issue," he said. "The Muslim faith is not to blame for ISIL, nor is it the fault of people of Middle Eastern descent."'Barbaric' crime must be punishedThe humanitarian aid group that employed Mr Haines voiced outrage at the "barbaric crime" and stressed it should not go unpunished.ACTED said it was "deeply stunned and horrified by the heinous assassination" of Mr Haines that the group "condemned with the greatest possible force"."The horrible assassination of David, a humanitarian worker, goes against every humanitarian principle and affects the whole of the humanitarian community," ACTED said.Before joining ACTED, an international relief charity, Mr Haines had been involved in humanitarian work in the Balkans, parts of Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East.Mr Haines' wife Dragana Prodanovic is still holed up with the couple's four-year-old daughter in their home in Sisak, Croatia.The couple met after Haines moved to Croatia in 2000 to work for the German humanitarian organisation Arbeiter Samariter Bund (ASB) in the central towns of Petrinja, Knin and Sisak.Near their home a handful of journalists wait under the watchful eye of police, hoping to catch a glance of Ms Prodanovic, who has avoided speaking to the press since news of her husband's death was made public."Looking at his girl is like looking at my own grandchildren," said a neighbour in his 60s, who was visibly shaken."After this, we wonder where this world is going."ABC/AFPPosted 14 Sep 2014Sun 14 Sep 2014 at 12:12pm, updated 15 Sep 2014Mon 15 Sep 2014 at 2:53am
