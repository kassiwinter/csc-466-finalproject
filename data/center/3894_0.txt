WASHINGTON—President Trump declared Wednesday a national day of mourning for former President George Herbert Walker Bush, who died Friday at the age of 94.The companies that run the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market both said their markets would be closed on Wednesday and would observe a moment of silence on Monday. The former president’s body will be flown to Washington on a government aircraft on Monday. Following a short service at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Bush’s body will lie in state in the rotunda from 7:30 p.m. Monday to 8:45 a.m. Wednesday.     A state funeral will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Washington National Cathedral, after which the former president’s body will be flown to Houston.               Mr. Bush’s body will lie in repose at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church from 6:45 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. Following a private funeral service at the church, his body will be interred at the George Bush Presidential Library & Museum at Texas A&M University.      Tributes to Mr. Bush, who died Friday at the age of 94, poured in from political dignitaries in the U.S. and around the world.     Mr. Bush served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. He was in office during the end of the Cold War and led America to a decisive victory in the first Persian Gulf War.     His death was announced late Friday by his son,         George W. Bush,    who followed in his footsteps to become America’s 43rd president in 2001. “George H.W. Bush was a man of the highest character and the best dad a son or daughter could hope for,” he said.                                         George H.W. Bush, America’s 41st president and father of 43rd President George W. Bush, has died at the age of 94. President Bush presided over the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union, the unification of Germany, and a decisive victory in the first Persian Gulf war. WSJ's Gerald F.

Mr. Bush’s funeral could also affect plans for a spending bill. Congressional leaders have been discussing the possibility of a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown when seven spending bills expire next weekend, according to people familiar with the discussions. While leaders haven’t yet made a decision, a short-term spending patch appears more likely in the face of Mr. Bush’s funeral proceedings, which prompted leaders to reconfigure the schedules for both the House and Senate next week. The former president will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol from Monday until Wednesday morning.     On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) and House Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) are expected to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House, where the spending negotiations are likely to come up, according to people familiar with the meeting.     Mr. Trump, at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, canceled a news conference scheduled for Saturday, citing Mr. Bush’s death.              Bill Clinton,    who defeated Mr. Bush in the 1992 presidential election but went on to become friends with his former rival, said few Americans would be able to match Mr. Bush’s record of service. “I saw it up close, working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina,” Mr. Clinton said in a statement with his wife, Hillary. “His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display.”     Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II. He went on to work in the oil industry before serving as a congressman, an envoy to the United Nations and China and head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican         Ronald Reagan’s    vice president and then succeeding him in the White House.     “While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude,” former President         Barack Obama    said.                   Sen. Jack Reed    of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cited Mr. Bush’s willingness to cross party lines to benefit the country and world, highlighting his signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work.     Former Soviet President         Mikhail Gorbachev    applauded Mr. Bush’s contributions toward ending the Cold War.     “I have a lot of memories of this man. We had the opportunity to work together during the era of great changes. It was a dramatic period, which required everyone to be tremendously responsible,” Mr. Gorbachev said.     “I pay tribute to George Bush’s contribution to this historical achievement. He was a true partner,” he said.     During the dying days of the Cold War, Mr. Bush played a pivotal role in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. “We mourn a great statesman and a friend of Germany,” said German Foreign Minister         Heiko Maas.    “Like few other U.S. presidents, George H.W. Bush was destined to provide his country with an orientation in a moment of historic change.”     In China, Mr. Bush was remembered as a steadfast supporter of engagement, shielding relations from domestic U.S. criticism. He played key roles in Washington’s dealing with Beijing, as an envoy prior to full diplomatic relations; as vice president, helping to forge common cause against the Soviet Union; and, as president, preserving ties after the Chinese military crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989.     “Old Bush, Without Doubt an ‘Old Friend of the Chinese People,’” ran the headline in the Global Times, a popular, nationalistic tabloid and an offshoot of People’s Daily. Posts on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, with the hashtag “Old Bush Passes Away” drew 70 million page views.     The emir of Kuwait, whose country Mr. Bush aided after an invasion by         Saddam Hussein’s    Iraq in 1990, praised the former president for “his rejection of the Iraqi occupation in its early hours…and his pivotal role in forming an International coalition.” The victory over Hussein’s forces was swift and decisive.     —Kristina Peterson in Washington, Charles Hutzler in Beijing, Emre Peker in Brussels, James Marson in Moscow and Ruth Bender in Berlin contributed to this article.
