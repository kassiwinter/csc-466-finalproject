                                                                                                                                         Hillary Clinton submitted to an interview with the FBI on Saturday as the Obama administration nears completion of its investigation into her use of a secret email server during her time as State Department secretary.                                                                                                                                                      The Clinton campaign confirmed the interview, which took place at FBI headquarters in Washington and lasted more than three hours.                                                                                                                                                      Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said it was “a voluntary interview.”                                                                                                                                                                    Mrs. Clinton is being investigated for her use of a secret email account, tied to a server she kept at her home in New York, during her four years in office. The practice broke State Department policy and nearly two dozen of the messages she sent or received are now marked “top secret.”                                                                                                                              She says she didn’t break any secrecy laws and President Obama has already declared her innocent, but the FBI is investigating, and security experts debate whether she did run afoul of laws that require classified information to be better protected.                                                                                                                                                       “Secretary Clinton gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary,” campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. “She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion. Out of respect for the investigative process, she will not comment further on her interview.”
