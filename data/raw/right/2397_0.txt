Speaking from the RNC convention stage Thursday, Ivanka Trump made the case that under a Trump presidency, childcare will become more affordable thanks to changes in federal law.
"As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce, and he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all," she said after re-upping the myth of the gender pay gap. That stance is earning high praise from liberals who have been arguing for years the federal government should get involved to regulate the cost of childcare. i mean, she basically outlined Hillary Clinton's pro-working family's policy agenda... https://t.co/STm1bAK2Kg— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) July 22, 2016
Great speech from Ivanka. A Dem couldn't have laid out a more progressive vision of mandated gender wage equality and universal childcare— Julie Roginsky (@julieroginsky) July 22, 2016
I don't need to. I've written policy speeches identical to hers for many liberal politicians. https://t.co/rpOT14z6rX— Julie Roginsky (@julieroginsky) July 22, 2016
