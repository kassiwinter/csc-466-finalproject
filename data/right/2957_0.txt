           Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., blasted President Donald Trump's decision to pardon a former Arizona sheriff who was accused of racially profiling Latinos.
McCain's office released a statement early Saturday morning that explained the lawmaker's views on Trump's full pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
"No one is above the law and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold," McCain said.
"Mr. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for continuing to illegally profile Latinos living in Arizona based on their perceived immigration status in violation of a judge's orders."
McCain said Trump had the power to grant the pardon, "but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions."
The White House announced Trump's pardon of Arpaio late Friday, which prompted lawmakers to criticize the move.
"Regarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course," said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.            Â© 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
