 
The Romney campaign is hammering the Obama campaign over its accusation that Mitt Romney's work on Bain Capital either involves a lie or a "felony", but the Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter doubled down on that attack Sunday.
Appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation," Cutter insisted that she had not called the presumptive RepublicanÂ presidential nominee a "felon," but she wouldn't abandon the overall argument, again insisting that Romney had either lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission or that he was lying now about his work at Bain while he was overseeing the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.
Appearing on the same show, senior Romney adviser Kevin Madden repeatedly called the attacks "disappointing," and insisted Romney deserved an apology.
"He's not going to get an apology," Cutter said.
