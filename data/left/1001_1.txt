Washington (CNN) - After weeks of near silence without any hint of a potential compromise between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans over the thorny issue of raising the nation's debt ceiling, the White House may be offering some conciliatory language that could lead to a deal to prevent a potential default on Oct. 17. 
As of last Friday, White House officials declined to specify any demand as to the length of a debt ceiling increase.
A White House official said Monday morning it is up to Congress to decide how long the debt ceiling increase should last.
"It is up to Congress to pass a debt limit increase, and up to them for how long and when they want to deal with this again," a White House official told CNN. "We have been super clear we think longer is better because it lends more certainty."
However, a separate White House official repeated the President's position that he will not offer concessions in exchange for an increase in the debt limit.
"Only Congress can raise the debt ceiling. We will not negotiate with them over that responsibility."
Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, used similar language Monday morning.
"What he (President Obama) has said is, however, that he is not going to sanction negotiations with any factions that are using the threat of default as a way of extracting policy in our democracy. The president's made clear, the era of threatening default has to be over," said Sperling at a Politico Playbook breakfast.
