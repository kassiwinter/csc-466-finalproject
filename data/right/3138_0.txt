                                                                                                                                         President Trump and others in his campaign operation received an email with the encryption key and website address for WikiLeaks documents, according to a CNN exclusive report Friday, but when they received this information, and what they actually knew, has been called into question.                                                                                                                                                      CNN originally reported that the email was sent in early September of last year, just a few weeks before WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages directly with each other on Twitter.                                                                                                                                                      The Washington Post reported Friday afternoon, however, that the emails referred to in the CNN report were ones that were already public, not unreleased documents as was previously indicated.”                                                                                                                                                                    An attorney for Mr. Trump Jr. told the newspaper that the email was not read or responded to and was turned over to the House Intelligence Committee as part of the ongoing investigation.                                                                                                                              Investigators are trying to figure out whether the sender made a legitimate effort to give the documents to the Trump campaign. CNN said they were unable to contact the individual who provided the information.                                                                                                                                                       White House counselor Kellyanne Conway blasted CNN and its reporters on Twitter, urging them to “be honest & keep explaining the much-repeated lie you let live for hours. Tell America WHY the date of the email is important. (Hint: it destroys your attempt to destroy @DonaldJTrumpJr).”
