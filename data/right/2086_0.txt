                                                                                                                                         Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has surged to his highest-ever standing in CBS News/New York Times polling, hitting 35 percent in a survey released Thursday.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Trump picked up 13 points of support in the poll since October. Sen. Ted Cruz is now in second place at 16 percent, while retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who led Mr. Trump in October, was in third at 13 percent.                                                                                                                                                      Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was in fourth at 9 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, was at 3 percent â€” his lowest percentage in CBS News polling.                                                                                                                                                                    Most Trump supporters say their minds are made up, compared to about a quarter of voters who are supporting someone other than him.                                                                                                                   Most of the poll was conducted before Mr. Trump announced his proposal earlier this week to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.
