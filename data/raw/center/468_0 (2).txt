                                                                  Hurricane Ida arrived in Louisiana Sunday every bit as ornery as advertised: 150 mph winds, some of the fiercest to ever hit American shores, bringing with them intense rainfall and storm surge that left a swath of carnage in its wake.The massive storm, which arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, sent rescuers scrambling to retrieve people from attics as flood waters poured into places like Lafitte, LaPlace and Braithwaite. The winds, matching the highest speeds ever recorded in Louisiana, tore roofs off homes, toppled transmission towers and left historic buildings in ruin. In Grand Isle, near where Ida made landfall, a helicopter airlifted several people who rode out the storm.Two people were confirmed dead by state and local officials Monday, a toll that was expected to rise, especially as people hauled out generators to withstand suffocating August heat. The storm decimated infrastructure across southeast Louisiana, leaving hundreds of thousands with the prospect of being without power and water for days or even weeks.A 400-foot transmission tower near Avondale, supporting a band of electricity cable nearly three-quarters of a mile long, withstood Katrina but came toppling down when Ida tore through. On Monday, it lay in a mangled pile of rusted metal next to the Mississippi River. That and other blows to Entergy’s transmission knocked out power to most of metro New Orleans, including the entirety of the city.Communications were likewise crippled. AT&T lost service throughout a wide swath of south Louisiana for much of the day, leaving people unable to call for help from their flooded homes. More than 1 million customers -- an estimated 2 million people or more -- were out of power ahead of a week of sweltering summer weather. The storm left 641,000 people without access to clean water, including about 312,000 who were without water completely.The damage prompted Jefferson Parish officials to arrange for buses to help residents evacuate. People living in and around Kenner were told to prepare for five days without water and three weeks without power. Gov. John Bel Edwards described the scene Monday as “catastrophic,” and said it would take months for the region to fully recover.                                  A Hurricane Ida zag delivered flooding rain to St. John and hurricane-force winds to the New Orleans area“There are an awful lot of unknowns right now,” Edwards said. “I can’t tell you when the power is going to be restored, I can’t tell you when the debris is going to be cleaned up and the repairs made and so forth.“The winds were extremely strong and sustained at 150 miles per hour for a long period of time. I’ve been seeing reports that gusts that entered the 170s, maybe low 180s in different places. This wreaks havoc on infrastructure, and that includes the electrical grid.”                                                                                                                                                                    THE PUNISHING PATH OF IDA: Map shows Hurricane Ida’s track through southeast Louisiana and some of the devastation left in its wake                                                                                             BY DAN SWENSON | Graphics Editor                                                                                               But unlike Katrina, which caused an estimated 1,800 deaths, mostly as a result of drowning, Ida didn’t bring catastrophic flooding to New Orleans. That’s because the just-completed $14.5 billion system of levees, floodwalls, pumps and gates built after Katrina largely kept the storm surge and flooding at bay. Edwards said officials had not identified any levees that failed, though some smaller levees in southeast Louisiana that are not part of the federal system were overtopped, letting water stream into homes.                                  Those in and around Kenner could lack water for five days, power for three weeks, officials warnAbout 200,000 residents of New Orleans -- well over half -- stayed behind to ride out Ida, compared with up to 90% of residents who fled ahead of Katrina. Still, city officials had only confirmed one death Monday, a resident who drowned while driving a car through a flooded low spot. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged people who evacuated not to come home yet, echoing similar pleas from officials across the hard-hit parishes.While the levees held, New Orleans was hardly spared.Once ashore, Ida wobbled, bringing its eastern edge near the city, and with it, sustained winds between 75 and 80 mph at Louis Armstrong International Airport. That jog spared Baton Rouge from the worst of Ida’s winds.       Get hurricane updates in your inbox               Sign up for updates on storm forecasts, tracks and more.                      The historic Karnofsky Tailor Shop -- one of the city’s most crucial jazz landmarks, where Louis Armstrong lived and bought his first cornet -- was unrecognizable Monday, transformed into a heap of bricks. Next door, a mural depicting Buddy Bolden and his band had disappeared from the side of the Little Gem Saloon, the wall ripped from the studs. A mile and a half away, in Treme, the iron cross that sits atop St. Augustine Church was bent from Ida’s winds, hanging precariously from the historic church’s belfry.In an echo of Katrina, schools announced indefinite closures.                                  Grand Isle's stranded greeted helicopter crew checking on them with 'thumbs up' sign: sheriffIn other southeast parishes, the scene was more dire still, especially in places not protected by federally built levees.Ida’s storm surge topped floodwalls in the Lafitte area in lower Jefferson Parish, bringing the highest water that Parish Council member Deano Bonano has ever seen in the town. Officials dispatched more than 30 boats to rescue people from attics after sections of the highway went underwater.In LaPlace, Lesia Landry watched the wind howl and rain blow in sheets that looked like snow and ultimately decided to take refuge on her kitchen island. She remained there for hours as the water rose in her house.In all, up to 17 inches of rain fell across St. John the Baptist Parish, swamping homes at the same time several feet of water surged in from Lake Pontchartrain. Helicopters buzzed overhead Monday as sheriff’s deputies launched boats into the flooded roadways. Dozens of residents had to be rescued; there were no known casualties as of Monday afternoon.                                  'A rough ride,' as 160-plus patients evacuate Louisiana's hospitals after Hurricane IdaIn Houma, a group of six people who rode out the storm piled out of a Coast Guard helicopter in the parking lot of the city’s civic center, their clothes dirtied from the storm and belongings packed into duffel bags. They had hunkered down in Grand Isle, near where Ida made landfall, finally escaping from the motel they stayed in, which by then was barely standing. The helicopter plucked them from the island town; the roads were impassable by car.“I thought we were going to blow away,” recounted Kelly Smith. “That building was shaking like I can’t even tell you. We could see debris pilings from buildings floating everywhere. There were whole buildings floating by.”Ida landed as a Category 4 just outside of Port Fourchon, making it more powerful than Katrina, a Category 3 at landfall. That made Ida one of the strongest hurricanes to ever hit the U.S., matching several storms at fifth for highest wind speeds to hit land. The only storms to match its intensity in Louisiana were the Last Island hurricane of 1856 and Hurricane Laura, which devastated southwest Louisiana last year.Ida took aim at Louisiana a year after a slew of harrowing hurricanes slammed the state, topped by Laura. Those storms brought the southwest portion of the state to its knees and exposed fragile infrastructure across south Louisiana.Ida’s unwelcome visit also came as the state continues to grapple with its worst coronavirus surge since the pandemic began, with hospitals full of COVID patients.                                  Rescuers descend on a flooded Lafitte to help stranded residents, some in atticsOchsner Health, Louisiana’s largest hospital system, was working Monday to evacuate 165 patients from its hardest-hit hospitals. Ida had torn off parts of roofs and blown out windows at several facilities, CEO Warner Thomas told reporters. Generators failed, and Terrebonne General Hospital asked for help moving about 100 patients after “significant roof damage.” A host of health care facilities were running on generator power, Edwards said.“It was a heck of a storm,” said Ben Schott, the meteorologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service in New Orleans. “I’m still a little sick to my stomach about what we might actually hear about in some of the places we haven’t heard from yet. Golden Meadow, or Lafourche or Houma.”                                                  Shopping                         Purchases made via links on our site may earn us an affiliate commission
