  When newly hired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was brought on board, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who had also been serving as a communications director, gave his notice. But just 10 days after Scaramucci’s first unofficial day and more than two weeks ahead of his official start date, Scaramucci has been removed from his post — and Spicer appears to still work in the White House. Scaramucci began to serve in the role of White House communications director on Friday, July 21, and was due to officially begin August 15. His hiring provoked the immediate resignation of Sean Spicer and the belated ousting of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on Friday, July 28. (On Thursday, July 27, the New Yorker published reporter Ryan Lizza’s account of a profanity-laced phone call he received from Scaramucci, in which Scaramucci insulted Priebus as “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.”)
Gen. John Kelly, who had been serving as Department of Homeland Security secretary, was appointed by President Trump Friday afternoon as the new chief of staff, and on Monday, he reportedly pushed for Scaramucci’s firing. Through Scaramucci’s entire stint as White House communications director, just 10 days that somehow felt much longer, Spicer was apparently quietly continuing to serve out his term through August, as he tweeted he would following his resignation. Now that Scaramucci is officially out, it looks like Spicer may end up outlasting him.
