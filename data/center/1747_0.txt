WASHINGTON—The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to cancel coming oral arguments on two pillars of former President      Donald Trump’s        immigration policy, construction of a wall along the southern U.S. border and the “Remain in Mexico” program that barred U.S. entry to many asylum applicants while their cases were considered.The filings are among the first of many the Justice Department is expected to make as the Biden administration changes direction on immigration, LGBT protections, voting rights, the Affordable Care Act and other policies. In both cases, acting Solicitor General         Elizabeth Prelogar,    who represents the federal government at the Supreme Court, cited first-day actions of the Biden administration.      On Jan. 20, President Biden terminated the emergency Mr. Trump declared along the southern border, an action the previous administration argued allowed it to pull money Congress had allocated to other projects for construction of the wall, which lawmakers had refused to fund. Lower courts found the Trump administration exceeded its authority, but the Supreme Court’s conservative majority allowed the reallocations to continue and construction to proceed while appeals were pending.               In the asylum case, Ms. Prelogar cited a Jan. 20 directive from the acting secretary of homeland security,         David Pekoske,    suspending new enrollment in the asylum program, which formally is called the Migrant Protection Protocols.     Arguments in the wall case are scheduled for Feb. 22, while the justices on March 1 are set to review the Trump administration policy that required asylum seekers at the border to wait in Mexico while their requests are considered.     Lower courts ruled that the asylum policy and some of the border wall’s funding were unlawful, prompting appeals from the Trump administration. If the Biden administration ultimately drops the appeals, as expected, the lower court decisions will remain in force.                                         President Biden has proposed a comprehensive immigration-reform plan. But as WSJ’s Gerald F. Seib explains, he faces an uphill climb that could be even tougher than what previous administrations faced.

Relative continuity has been a tradition at the Justice Department, and courts sometimes frown upon dramatic swings in posture by the nation’s leading law enforcer from one administration to the next. Legal observers say the Trump-led department at times strained that tradition. It changed its stance in at least 10 notable cases involving voting rights, immigration, health care and labor law during Mr. Trump’s first year in office.     For instance, the Justice Department typically defends acts of Congress, regardless of whether the current president would have signed the legislation in the first place. The Trump administration, however, dropped its defense of the Affordable Care Act, choosing to embrace a novel legal theory that the health-care overhaul became unconstitutional when Congress reduced to zero the penalty for failing to maintain insurance. At oral arguments in November, justices across the ideological spectrum appeared skeptical of that claim.      While the Biden administration can’t pull the case—it was filed by the state of Texas, with Trump administration backing—it can inform the justices it no longer stands by the arguments made by the former administration’s lawyer, former acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall.      “You don’t want to change positions from the past administration if you can, but if you’ve got some outlier position, you’re almost really compelled to,”         Neal Katyal,    a veteran of the Obama-era solicitor general’s office, said during a Georgetown University Law Center event last week.     Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, said the Biden Justice Department team will want to be careful about which positions to disavow.     “If you’re thinking about the ideal sort of target, it would be one where everybody can see that the position you’re re-embracing or embracing is in the long-term interests of the government—and where you end up winning,” Mr. Clement said at the Georgetown event. “In that respect, it seems like the ACA case is a pretty good target.”     In addition to immigration, forthcoming Biden administration policy changes in other areas could make more pending cases irrelevant, including a Trump administration appeal seeking high-court approval for its rules barring federal family-planning grants to health clinics that offer on-site abortions or abortion referrals.     In a major voting case from Arizona, set for Supreme Court argument on March 2, the Trump Justice Department filed a brief supporting state rules prohibiting third parties from collecting absentee ballots, as well as out-of-precinct voting, in the name of election integrity. A lower court ruled against Arizona after finding that both measures disproportionately harmed minorities.      Voting-rights law has been an area of considerable difference between Democrats and Republicans, and the Arizona case is important because it gives the Supreme Court the chance to set clear rules under the Voting Rights Act about how to evaluate the potentially discriminatory effects of state voting laws.     The new department leadership also will face tough decisions on still-moving cases involving congressional investigations of Mr. Trump. One pending case at the Supreme Court examines whether Congress can have grand-jury materials from the Mueller probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The department under Trump argued it couldn’t.     On Feb. 23, the full federal appeals court in Washington will consider whether the Democratic-led House of Representatives can enforce a subpoena for testimony from former Trump White House counsel         Don McGahn,    a case that raises broad questions about whether Congress can compel testimony from a president’s close advisers. The department has argued that the House committee seeking Mr. McGhan’s testimony doesn’t have the constitutional authority to demand it.     Several cases that are still in the lower courts could also present dilemmas for the department, including a lawsuit the previous administration filed against former Trump national security adviser John Bolton alleging his bestselling memoir, published last year and highly critical of the former president, was unlawfully released before it received national security clearance.
