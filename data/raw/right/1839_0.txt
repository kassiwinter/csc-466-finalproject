                 | March 01, 2021 04:33 PM                Twitter said Monday it will start labeling coronavirus vaccine misinformation on its platform and warned that those who violate its rules repeatedly will face permanent bans.      "Starting today, we will begin applying labels to Tweets that may contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the service," Twitter said in a press release.            The vaccine labels may link to curated content and public health information or to the Twitter Rules page. Twitter said its goal with the misinformation labels was to provide users with "additional context and authoritative information about COVID-19."      The social media giant is also introducing a "strike system," which will punish users for repeated violations of its COVID-19 policy. Users will be notified directly when a label or required tweet removal occurs, and five or more strikes will result in permanent suspension. However, users who believe their account was locked or suspended in error can submit an appeal.
