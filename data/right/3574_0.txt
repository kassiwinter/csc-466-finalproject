It does not affect his fellow InfoWars admins, who will still be able to post on The Alex Jones Channel and the main InfoWars page, which both remain live.The decision to freeze Jones's account came after Facebook removed four videos he posted for violating its rules. These videos were also removed from YouTube, which gave Jones a 90-day ban on broadcasting live on the platform.The Alex Jones Show page and the main InfoWars account will be taken down if they post content violating Facebook's standards in the near future, Dailymail.com understands. 'Our Community Standards make it clear that we prohibit content that encourages physical harm [bullying], or attacks someone based on their religious affiliation or gender identity [hate speech],' Facebook said.'We remove content that violates our standards as soon as we're aware of it. In this case, we received reports related to four different videos on the Pages that InfoWars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook,' the spokesman added. Jones hit back in a Facebook post claiming he had been 'chosen as the sacrificial lamb on the alter of political correctness to signify an end to the freedom of speech.'The shock jock claimed the move was an example of 'massive censorship' and an 'infrastructural attack' on his network.  Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, defended their decision to host InfoWars in combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on WednesdayOn Wednesday, a promotional event for Facebook's new video feature in Beverly Hills descended into a shouting match as executives defended their decision to host InfoWars in angry exchanges with reporters.The reporter noted that Infowars host Alex Jones recently spread a fake story about special counsel Robert Mueller being a pedophile, telling his audience: 'They'd let Mueller rape kids in front of people, which he did.'Fidji Simo replied that although he found Infowars 'absolutely atrocious', Facebook's approach to freedom of expression meant the company would only reduce the distribution of Infowars posts, rather than ban it completely.A report of the event by Entertainment Weekly said Simo explained how Facebook posted flags next to some Infowars stories warning they had been fact-checked as potentially untrue and told its algorithm not to share them widely.'What we're trying to do is make it so that, if you are saying something that is untrue, you're allowed to say it, as long as you an authentic person,' he said. 'We try to make it so that it doesn't get much distribution.'A reporter also asked why Facebook was allowing Fox News to post videos on Watch despite what he called its 'incorrigible' record of 'proliferating misinformation'. The decision to freeze Jones's account came after Facebook removed four videos he posted for violating its rules.
