The latest White House fence jumper has been charged with assault of two police dogs and making threats, officials said Thursday, and has had previous run-ins with law enforcement at the executive mansion and elsewhere.Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Md., is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for jumping outstanding warrants, the Secret Service said in a statement.The White House intruder, who kicked and punched at White House security dogs after he landed on the North Lawn of the White House, has also been charged with resisting arrest and unlawful entry.A veterinarian treated the two members of the canine unit -- Hurricane and Jordan -- for minor bruising, the service said in a statement.The president was in the residence at the time of the intrusion; the man was unarmed.This is not Adesanya's first arrest at the White House.Records show he was also charged with unlawful entry at the White House complex in late July, reported the Associated Press. A court document says he told an officer that a security barrier he jumped over "was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well."The president was in the residence at the time of the intrusion; the man was unarmed.The incident took place a month after another jumper raced across the White House lawn and made his way inside the building.That Sept. 19 intrusion, along with reports of other security problems, triggered investigations of the Secret Service and led to the resignation of director Julia Pierson.The intrusion onto the White House grounds also came the same day that a gunman went on a rampage in Canada's capital city of Ottawa, including the Parliament building.
