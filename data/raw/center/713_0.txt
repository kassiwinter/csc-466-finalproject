Health officials across the world are issuing warnings over the use of antimalarial drugs after President Trump’s comments about treating the coronavirus with them sparked panic-buying and overdoses.In recent days, thousands of consumers across Africa and South Asia rushed to stockpile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs that are usually used to combat malaria, vacuuming up supplies in cities in the developing world, sending prices skyrocketing and prompting panicked warnings from local authorities. In the U.S. and some other developed countries, meantime, some doctors have started to prescribe the drugs against the coronavirus, sparking heated ethical debates because their efficacy has yet to be demonstrated in full-scale clinical studies.     At issue, health officials said, is how to reconcile the pace of rigorous scientific research with the exponential spread of the infection.               “There is no known dosage for Covid-19 and whether it can actually cure it, it’s safer to avoid chloroquine,” said         Dr. Chris Kaganda,    a Ugandan public health expert, referring to the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. “But you know these are desperate times.”     Nigeria’s government on Saturday said three people had been hospitalized after overdosing on chloroquine, while pharmacies in Lagos, the continent’s largest city at 20 million people, reported running out of supplies.     Similar panic-buying scenes took place in Uganda, Ghana, Kenya and Morocco. Chloroquine has also sold out in pharmacies across Pakistan, according to those looking for the drug.     Chloroquine-based drugs are common in Africa, which accounts for 92% of malaria cases in the world. The drugs can be bought over the counter without prescription and are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.     President Trump said at a White House briefing last week that he told the Food and Drug Administration to expedite the study and use of the “very powerful” drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The president doubled down on Saturday, posting on his Twitter feed that hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin “taken together” could be “one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine” and urged them to be deployed “IMMEDIATELY.”     Mr. Trump’s claims immediately began trending on social media across Africa. In Nigeria, which has reported 22 cases of the virus, the stockpiling and hospitalizations forced health officials to warn citizens against self-medicating with the drug. The country’s Centre for Disease Control said the World Health Organization hasn’t approved use of the drug against the virus.

In France, interest in antimalarial drugs surged last week after a French professor released a study showing that 100% of patients infected by coronavirus and treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the azithromycin antibiotic were cured after six days. The proportion of cured patients was 70% for those treated only with hydroxychloroquine and 12.5% for those who received no treatment, the study showed.     Although the study had a very limited scope—it encompassed only about 30 patients and the results didn’t include data from a person who died during the survey and five others who encountered problems such as nausea—French Prof.         Didier Raoult    said he opted to publish the findings because of the urgent need for an effective drug against coronavirus.     Among his patients was French lawmaker         Valérie Boyer.    “She has known the doctor for a long time and trusts him,” said         Maxence Jouve,    Ms. Boyer’s parliamentary assistant. She is still weak, but is doing better and was sent home a few days ago, he added.     Inserm, a research institute affiliated with the French health ministry, said Sunday that it had added hydroxychloroquine to a list of experimental treatments it will test as part of a broader European study.     But while experts have warned that there is no scientific evidence yet that the drug is effective against the virus, some doctors say they can’t wait for the results of clinical studies.     Christian Perronne, a French doctor, said he had started to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to coronavirus patients at a hospital near Paris, explaining that was all he had to fight against the pathogen.     “We have a drug that’s not expensive, that’s well-tolerated and that seems to work quite well. Are we going to wait until there’s more deaths before we say, ‘Actually, it’s not bad?,’” he said. “Until we find something better we have to use it. We have to go for it. We’re practicing military medicine.”                                         As many businesses around the world struggle, a Canadian disinfectant company is increasing production to keep up with demand during the novel coronavirus outbreak.

During that same period, hydroxychloroquine orders were up 260% compared with typical demand.      Chloroquine, approved for Americans in the 1940s, and hydroxychloroquine, greenlighted the next decade, are also prescribed for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs are considered relatively safe for most people although chloroquine is slightly more toxic.     Pharmacists who fill prescriptions for patients taking the drugs for lupus or rheumatoid arthritis are finding it difficult to find them in recent weeks.      While manufacturers have announced plans to ramp up production, both drugs are listed in shortage, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. The U.S. FDA doesn’t list them in shortage.     The number of coronavirus cases in Africa, the second-most populous continent in the world, on Monday is still lower than in Europe, Asia and the U.S. but is starting to rise rapidly. Confirmed infections rose to more than 1,200 in 42 countries. That is almost double the number since Friday, in one-third more countries.     The use of chloroquine to treat malaria had fallen significantly in recent years in many African nations due to high levels of resistance, experts say. In recent days, however, the panic over coronavirus sent many people to pharmacies for the drugs.     Bony Okwale, an electrician in Uganda who watched a video clip of President Trump’s talk about coronavirus last week, spent the weekend combing pharmacies in Kampala, the capital city. It was only on Sunday that the 25-year-old managed to procure the drug at a pharmacy in a nearby suburb.     “I wanted to buy two packs but the pharmacist had restricted sales to only one,” he said. “The queue was long, I had to wait for around two hours.”     —Jared S.
