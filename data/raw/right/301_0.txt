"Oh that poor bastard. Poor pathetic guy. He was pathetic," he added. "Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?" Trump said. "But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said what the hell is he doing? What is he on?"              "Beto. Ah, that poor bastard. Poor pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember, the arms are flailing, remember that?"… https://t.co/2H0j3Qqt92 — Shem Horne (@Shem Horne)     1572656659.0              O'Rourke announced on Friday that he would discontinue his long shot effort to win the Democratic nomination.
