DES MOINES, Iowa—Texas Sen. Ted Cruz outmuscled      Donald Trump        to win the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Monday, delivering a stinging rebuke to the celebrity businessman and establishing himself as a leading contender for the GOP nomination.The results Monday set the stage for a series of high-stakes showdowns in the weeks ahead between the top two finishers and Florida Sen.         Marco Rubio,    whose appeal as a general-election candidate was good enough for a late surge that nearly overtook Mr. Trump. “Tonight is a victory for the grass roots,” said Mr. Cruz to a raucous victory party in Des Moines. “Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.”     Mr. Trump kept his post-caucus remarks brief, thanking his family and the state of Iowa before turning his attention to contests that follow. “We love New Hampshire, we love South Carolina,” he said.        
Election 2016        The race in Iowa exposed cracks in Mr. Trump’s front-runner status. After a six-month ride atop the polls, his stardom wasn’t enough to overcome Mr. Cruz’s superior turnout machine and the Texan’s appeal with the party’s most conservative voters.               With 99% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz led the GOP field as the top pick of 27.7% of Republican caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Trump at 24.3% and Mr. Rubio at 23.1%.     Mr. Cruz’s victory was a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who entered the race as a little-known long shot, his rise a reflection of how much the GOP is now moved by the tea party and evangelical voters who have flocked to him.      The Texan generated his highest levels of support in Iowa from the most conservative caucusgoers, according to an entrance poll conducted for news organizations. He also performed well among evangelicals and Republicans who said he shared their values.          Mr. Rubio’s late surge will increase interest in his candidacy and ratchet up the pressure on less-viable Republicans to drop out of the race to give more centrist, business-friendly voters a clearer alternative to Messrs. Cruz and Trump.     “For months, they told us we had no chance,” Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters Monday night. “Tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state sent a very clear message.”     Mr. Rubio outpaced his rivals by big margins on the question of which candidate Republicans think can win in November, the entrance poll showed. He also built a big edge among caucusgoers who want the next president to be experienced. Those will be strong selling points in states where the electorate is less conservative than Iowa.     Messrs. Cruz and Trump had traded increasingly nasty barbs in the run-up to Iowa, setting up for a more bitter battle to follow. Mr. Trump has picked fights with rivals, major media organizations and party leaders in Washington, frequent skirmishes that have allowed him to dominate news coverage and drown out other Republicans with more typical resumes.                                         Despite late polls showing a possible victory, Donald Trump took second place behind Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), addresses his supporters in Des Moines.

But former Arkansas Gov.         Mike Huckabee    was a casualty of the Iowa caucuses, announcing on Twitter that he was withdrawing from the race.     Mr. Trump will get a chance to re-establish himself in states where polls show him up by as much as 20 percentage points—although he had led in most Iowa polls before the caucuses began.     In addition, many back-of-the-pack contenders ended 2015 with enough money to finance bare-bones campaigns through the first four nominating states in February, new campaign-finance reports suggest.          “These first four races are going to set the playoffs,” said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist on         Mitt Romney’s    2012 presidential bid. “To advance, you need to do well in these first four.”     Republicans may have to wait until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20 or possibly Super Tuesday on March 1 to get a clearer sense of which of the candidates have the strongest claim on the nomination.     Anger and frustration were defining features of the GOP electorate. Half described themselves as “dissatisfied, but not angry” about the way the federal government is working.      A somewhat smaller share said they were outright angry. And half of those Republicans who participated said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment.     Big crowds flocked to caucus sites around the state, and early surveys suggested the share of first-time caucusgoers had ticked up from 2012.      Total GOP turnout topped 184,000 voters, shattering the previous record of roughly 121,000 caucusgoers. A GOP precinct in Van Meter ran out of ballots and forms to register new voters. “We’re way past capacity,” said Bev McLinden, a local GOP official.     There were pockets of the state where Mr. Trump didn’t register any support. At a caucus meeting in Pleasant Hill, none of the hundreds of Republicans in attendance rose to speak on his behalf. “They said he had no ground game,” said Mary Dorin, a Cruz supporter.                                         Florida Senator Marco Rubio said his campaign took "an important step towards winning this election" after placing third in the Iowa caucuses behind Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.                                                                                                     At a caucus in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Cruz made his own case to the assembled voters, telling them he has the money to compete late into the nominating calendar by citing his conservatism and his ability to win a general election.     Mr. Trump’s improbable rise already has turned the race on its ear. The billionaire barely registered in public-opinion surveys last spring when he started making noise about a possible presidential bid, trailing by wide margins both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in September.     Mr. Trump drew his highest levels of support from caucusgoers who didn’t attend college, were more moderate and, first and foremost, listed immigration as their top issue, the entrance poll showed. He also drew higher support from caucusgoers eager for an outsider.     First-time caucusgoer Rachael Schwartz, 28, the mother of an 18-month-old daughter, said she likes Mr. Trump because he is outspoken and would let people make more decisions about their lives, such as whether to vaccinate their children. “I never paid attention to the future, and now it’s important to me,” she said. “I believe he’s for the people, and we will truly have a voice.”     Mr. Trump’s often-incendiary campaign rhetoric has turned off some would-be supporters who otherwise appreciate his brash style. Valerie Martin, 36, a nurse midwife who attended the Cruz event in Jefferson, was leaning toward Mr. Trump before settling on his main rival. “I don’t know how he will be taken by other countries,” she said.     Viability was a big lure on Monday as Republicans who planned to back other candidates decided to support one of the top-three.      Landon Myer, a quarry worker from Claire, Iowa was leaning toward Mr. Cruz, after considering Kentucky Sen.         Rand Paul.    “Cruz is the only one that’s going to stop Trump,” said Mr. Myer. “I feel a vote for Rand Paul is a wasted vote.”     —Ben Kesling contributed to this article.
