     A blast at a wedding party in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the border with Syria killed 50 people and injured dozens, according to a report Sunday by the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blamed ISIL militants for the bombing. Other Turkish officials said the militant group likely sent a suicide bomber to target the wedding late Saturday in the southeastern part of the country.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
In a statement, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim condemned the attack and vowed to combat terror.
“No matter what the name of this villainous terror that meant [the loss of] innocence and life, the state, government, and nation will continue our determined fight against it,” Yildirim said.
Turkey’s health officials in Gaziantep told Anadolu news agency that the bride and groom — Besna and Nurettin Akdogan — are being treated in a hospital for minor injuries.   Also On POLITICO
