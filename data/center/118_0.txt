                                                  Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said purchasing Greenland was ‘an absurd discussion.’                  Photo:            mads claus rasmussen/Shutterstock                                                                                                                                  Updated Aug. 21, 2019 10:27 am ET                      WASHINGTON—The White House on Tuesday canceled President         Trump’s    planned visit to Denmark after the prime minister said she wouldn’t entertain his proposal to purchase Greenland from the Scandinavian nation.      “Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister         Mette Frederiksen’s    comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time,”         Mr. Trump    wrote on Twitter.      The White House said later the president’s entire visit, which was scheduled for Sept. 2-3 and was to include dinner with Queen Margrethe II, had been canceled.     “The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!” Mr. Trump added on Twitter.               The Wall Street Journal last week first reported Mr. Trump had discussed acquiring Greenland, with varying degrees of seriousness.          “It is with regret and surprise that I received the news that president Trump has canceled his state visit to Denmark,” Denmark’s Ms. Frederiksen told reporters Wednesday. “I had been looking forward to the visit. Our preparations were well under way.”     She said it was an opportunity to celebrate the close relationship between Denmark and the U.S. and to discuss the geopolitical importance of the Arctic. The idea of the U.S. buying Greenland, she said, “has clearly been rejected.”     Greenland is an autonomous Danish territory. While Greenland’s government controls most domestic matters, foreign and security policy is handled by Copenhagen.     “Strategically, for the United States, it would be nice,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday. “Essentially, it’s a large real-estate deal,” said the president, a former real-estate developer.     Mr. Trump, who called Denmark an important ally, added, “It’s not No. 1 on the burner.”     Ms. Frederiksen on Sunday said it was “an absurd discussion,” though she said a closer relationship with the U.S. was welcome.     The president on Monday also seemed to make light of the issue, tweeting a picture of a towering, gold building with his name on it set in the Greenland landscape. “I promise not to do this to Greenland!” he wrote.
