 According to new polling released by Rasmussen Reports, a majority of voters aren't convinced the State of the Union Address tonight will actually mean much. Just 28% of voters think State of the Union speeches are important for setting the nationâ€™s agenda for the next year. Sixty-two percent (62%) view them instead as mostly just for show, up nine points from 53% a year ago when the president delivered the first State of the Union speech following his reelection. Obama's speech isn't expected to be ignored as a majority of voters at least plan to tune in and watch. We'll have full coverage here at Townhall.com of the President's speech.
