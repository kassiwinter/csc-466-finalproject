         Reporters from several major news outlets, including the         New York Times    and CNN, were excluded from attending a White House press briefing on Friday, an unusual move that underscores the increasingly strained relations between the new administration and the media.     The move prompted a sharp rebuke from the White House Correspondents’ Association, which said it “is protesting strongly against how today’s gaggle is being handled by the White House.”      The White House initially had planned the event as an on-camera briefing with press secretary         Sean Spicer    in the briefing room but later restricted it to a smaller, off-camera gathering in Mr. Spicer’s office.     While holding a smaller press briefing isn’t unusual, the White House broke from protocol in barring journalists from the New York Times, CNN, Politico and BuzzFeed—which have been criticized by President Donald Trump and his administration for their reporting—from the event. Reporters from the Associated Press and Time Magazine boycotted the event in protest of how it was handled.               “Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said in a statement. “Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.”     Politico said in a statement: “Selectively excluding news organizations from White House briefings is misguided, and our expectation is that this action will not be repeated.”     A Wall Street Journal reporter attended the briefing, along with representatives of other news organizations, including ABC,       CBS,    Bloomberg, Fox News, Breitbart News, the Washington Times and One America News Network.     Journal editors said the paper was unaware that other outlets were being excluded from the session.     “The Wall Street Journal strongly objects to the White House’s decision to bar certain media outlets from today’s gaggle. Had we known at the time, we would not have participated and we will not participate in such restricted briefings in the future,” said a statement from Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal.         CBS News said it was serving as the TV and radio pool outlet for the event and felt obligated to attend on behalf of other news outlets. Bloomberg News also said it was a member of the press pool and that its reporter only became aware that other outlets had been barred from attending just as the event was beginning.     When asked during the briefing why some outlets weren’t allowed in and whether it was a punitive move aimed at outlets that have offered critical coverage of the president, Mr. Spicer defended the administration’s efforts at accessibility.     “We have shown an abundance of accessibility and have brought more reporters into this process,” he said. “We’ve gone above and beyond in making our briefing room more accessible than any prior administration.”     The White House did invite to the briefing representatives of the press pool, a small group of journalists who take turns covering White House events and who share their reporting with a larger group of media outlets.     The briefing exclusions happened just hours after President Trump’s repeated criticisms of the media as an “enemy of the people” at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He has maintained an antagonistic relationship with the media, which his top advisers have referred to publicly as an “opposition party.” The president and administration officials have routinely dismissed critical stories as “fake news.”     “Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like,” CNN said in a statement.
