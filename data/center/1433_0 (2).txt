Mitt Romney     called Sen. John McCain on Tuesday to discuss his interest in running for the presidency, the Arizona Republican said Tuesday.     “He told me that he’s seriously considering it, and we discussed issues and friendships and things like that,” Mr. McCain, the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nominee, told reporters. “We had a long conversation. We’re very good friends.”      Mr. McCain said he was “open” to supporting Mr. Romney, who last week told a group of donors he was considering a run for the White House in 2016.     But Mr. McCain said that for now is focused on backing Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and frequent ally, whom Mr. McCain has been publicly pushing to get in the race.          “Yes, I am open to it, but I think Lindsey will be in it until the final primary,” Mr. McCain said on whether he would potentially support Mr. Romney.     At a separate event, Mr. McCain said he would "respect any decision [Mr. Romney] might make. I am a great admirer of Mr. Romney's."     Mr. Romney ran unsuccessfully for the party's nomination in 2008 and was defeated by President          Barack Obama     in the general election in 2012.
