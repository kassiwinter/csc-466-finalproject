Unless you've been under a rock, you're probably aware that a total solar eclipse was visible today from the United States. Many people, including the First Family, went outside and donned a pair of solar glasses (or used an old-school pinhole viewer) to take a look at the phenomena.While the Trumps mostly followed directions and used proper eye safety protocol, one picture showed the president looking up at the sun sans glasses--a big no-no that could potentially result in eye damage. yep, trump looked without glasses #solareclipse

Attorney General Jeff Sessions looked as though he had a grand ole time watching the eclipse through a pair of safety glasses. Sessions and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross watched together on the White House balcony.Most adorable eclipse photo goes to...
