Abroad he must manage confrontations with Russia over Ukraine, China over Taiwan and Iran over its nuclear program.Biden on Tuesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to reduce tensions over a military build-up on Ukraine’s border and proposed a summit of the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of disputes.Biden sent former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd and former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg to Taiwan on Tuesday in what a White House official called a “personal signal” of his commitment to the island and its democracy.In February, Pelosi said she would invite Biden to deliver the speech after Congress passed his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. Biden signed the legislation on March 11.Reporting by Eric Beech, Steve Holland and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Gerry Doylefor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up
