The union representing journalists at the Bloomberg industry publication group on Monday condemned the company's decision to bar journalists across the broader Bloomberg organization from investigating Democratic candidates for president.In a statement released on Twitter, the guild, which represents Bloomberg Law, Bloomberg Tax, Bloomberg Government and Bloomberg Environment called the company's decision an effort to "silence" the company's reporters."We are extremely alarmed by management's decision to silence the journalists we represent at Bloomberg Industry Group, as well as the unrepresented journalists at Bloomberg News," the guild wrote."The Guild believes journalists should not only be allowed — but encouraged — to thoroughly cover every single candidate as the profession demands in one of the most important elections in modern history," it continued.Our statement regarding #Bloomberg’s editorial decision not to investigate Democratic Presidential candidates@business @BBGIndustry @BLaw @environment @BGOV @tax pic.twitter.com/BZcSU3mdNB— Guild at Bloomberg Industry Group (@GuildatBIG) November 26, 2019The guild's statement comes as Bloomberg announced in a letter to employees that the company would not publish investigations of the Democratic presidential candidates following billionaire owner Michael BloombergMichael BloombergAmericans think Biden's presidency is a failure — Democrats can fix that Overnight Defense & National Security — Defense gets OK to help civilians evacuate Michael Bloomberg to head Defense Innovation Board MORE's entry into the 2020 race as a Democratic primary candidate.“We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation) and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries. We cannot treat Mike’s democratic competitors differently from him," read a staff memo from Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait."We have already assigned a reporter to follow his campaign (just as we did when Mike was in City Hall)," he continued. "And in the stories we write on the presidential contest, we will make clear that our owner is now a candidate."One former Bloomberg employee slammed the company's decision in a statement to The Hill earlier Monday, calling it a poor attempt at fairness.“To cover a presidential election fairly, you're going to have to cover Bloomberg like everyone else,” the former employee said. “That means taking oppo [opposition research]. And that means digging into his past ... it's just silly to believe there will be an acceptable and fair way for them to cover his campaign.”
