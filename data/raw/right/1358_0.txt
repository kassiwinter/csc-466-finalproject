           President Donald Trump said he might be "immune" to the coronavirus after he returned to the White House Monday evening, where he will continue his treatment for the disease.
Trump spent three days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after he tested positive for COVID-19 Thursday. He was given several drugs to treat the infection, including an anti-viral, an antibody cocktail, and a steroid.
Trump released a video after his return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in which he said, "Now I'm better. And maybe I'm immune, I don't know. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently."
Trump's doctors said the president improved over the weekend after he was given the treatments, with White House physician Sean Conley saying he met the qualifications to be released on Sunday.
Prior to Trump being airlifted to Walter Reed on Friday, however, the White House medical team was concerned about his condition. Trump reportedly had a fever and was given supplemental oxygen after his blood oxygen level dropped.
After he exited Marine One on the White House South Lawn Monday night, Trump walked onto a balcony and took off his medical mask, for which he has been criticized since he still has the virus that's infected 7.6 million Americans and killed more than 215,000.
