At 10 a.m., 1,000 students walked out of Stuyvesant High School in New York City. An hour later, 2,800 filed out of Curie Metropolitan High School in Chicago. An hour after that, 1,000 went to the capitol in Boise, Idaho. And an hour after that, 1,000 walked out of Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, with signs that read “Am I next?” In a wave across the country Wednesday morning, students voted with their feet to protest government inaction on gun control. Nearly 1 million students took part in protests, which included kindergartners through high-school seniors. In New York, the nation’s largest school district, 100,000 students walked out. The 17-minute walkouts marked one month since a gunman killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. In that same span, there have been 10 school shootings in the U.S.     Far from big cities, in rural states with high levels of gun-ownership, students protested. Anna Strong Garcia, a 17-year-old senior at Billings Senior High School, said, “We don’t expect Montana to be the leader in gun-control laws, but we don’t want to be left behind.”               More than 3,000 registered demonstrations took place in all 50 states, according to organizers with Women’s March Youth Empower, which helped coordinate the “#Enough” school walkouts. It put the initial tally at nearly 1 million and said it was still counting. About 56 million students attend pre-K through 12th grade in public and private schools, according to federal data.     In the Atlanta Public Schools, about 16,000 students—mostly middle- and high-school students—participated in walkouts, officials said. The school system has about 52,000 students.      In Washington, D.C., several thousand students congregated in front of the White House, their backs turned, and held a 17-minute moment of silence.     In Los Angeles, student leaders urged 1,000 students gathered at Hamilton High School not to let the issue fade after the moment had passed. “I’m begging you—call your representatives,” Miriam Schweiger, a 17-year-old senior, said on a microphone.     At Parkland’s Stoneman Douglas High School, whose students have taken to traditional and social media to help turn their own tragedy into a national campaign for tougher gun laws, students filed onto the football field for a 17-minute protest, marking the loss of the 17 victims.     With hundreds of students gathered on the field, Principal Ty Thompson addressed the crowd: “We are going to make change, and it’s already starting.”                                          Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School talked to The Wall Street Journal about the school walkouts nationwide.                                                                                                     Outside,         Allison Macleod,    whose son Jack is a junior at the school, carried a sign reading, “Our Kids Will Not Be Ignored.” She wrote it on the back of an advertisement for a gun show that she said she pulled out of the ground after the shooting.      “These kids have been activated,” said Ms. Macleod, a 51-year-old real-estate agent who plans to attend the “March for Our Lives” rally in Washington, D.C., on March 24. “That’s it. They’re going to get this done.”     In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Stoneman Douglas students “took that moment and their frustration and grievance to speak up about gun violence and demand Congress’s action,” said Winter Minisee, a 17-year-old senior in Riverside, Calif., and one of the Enough organizers. “We want to capitalize off that.”     Sustained pressure from students has been pushing politicians to action.      President      Donald Trump,        who was away from the U.S. capital Wednesday, on Sunday unveiled proposals for reducing gun violence at schools that included training school staffers to carry concealed weapons but not earlier calls to raise the age limit for buying guns.     On Wednesday afternoon, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill, dubbed the Stop School Violence Act, which will authorize $50 million in annual funding for school security upgrades. Last week,         Florida Gov. Rick Scott    signed into law a measure that added new gun restrictions, such as raising the minimum age to buy any type of firearm to 21.           But many students are calling for more action. Among the demands listed by the Enough campaign are a ban on semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, and the expansion of background checks to all gun sales.     At Curie Metropolitan in Chicago’s southwest side,         Eric Reed    said the protest wasn’t just about the tragedy at Parkland. The city has among the highest rates of gun violence of the largest U.S. cities, concentrated in south- and westside neighborhoods that flank Curie.      “In my neighborhood, I don’t even go outside because they be shooting all the time,” said Mr. Reed, a 16-year-old sophomore. “I’m here to make sure our politicians work to keep us safe.”     In Washington, D.C., the east lawn of the Capitol was covered with 7,000 pairs of shoes, one for each child killed since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., according to activists.     The students who gathered in front of the White House followed their silent protest by marching down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, chanting: “Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go!”     The National Rifle Association was the focus of protests in Sacramento, Calif., too, with students from Oakland, San Francisco and other cities rallying in front of an NRA office. Organizers also offered training to students on how to lobby lawmakers.      Some students marched despite threats of disciplinary action by their schools.     “They need to know how many people really care, and how many kids are sacrificing to come out,” said         Maya Kagan,    a sophomore at Bethesda Chevy Chase High School in Montgomery County, Md., who helped organize the White House protest using social media.                                          In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, student survivors have started a movement for greater gun control.

Viacom Inc.    said its television networks, including MTV, BET and Comedy Central, suspended programming for 17 minutes in sympathy with the students.     Some planned walkouts were canceled or postponed due to heavy snow in New England. In Raleigh, N.C., Broughton High School postponed its protest and the school was on lockdown Wednesday morning, after a student reported a Snapchat post with a possible threat against the school, according to the Wake County Public School System. Police are investigating, the principal said.     In Parkland, another walkout that was part of the Enough campaign took place at a nearby park, where hundreds of students and supporters gathered. Makeshift memorials for the 17 shooting victims were arrayed across the grass.      Among the numerous speakers was         Tanzil Philip,    a 16-year-old sophomore at Stoneman Douglas who led the crowd in a chant. “What do we want?” he asked. “Gun control now!” the crowd roared back.      “When do we want it?” he asked. “Now!” they replied.
