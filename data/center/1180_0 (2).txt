         Regarding your editorial "Immigration Breakout" (Jan. 30): American citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and handing it out en masse to illegal immigrants is simply indefensible. They do have a "path to citizenship" today and will continue to do so under a plan that provides legalization without a path to citizenship: the current legal process.      As faulty as the policy logic is, however, the political logic is worse. Leave aside the fact that immigration is unimportant to most voters. With ObamaCare sucking the oxygen out of the political atmosphere and weighing down Democrats nationwide, Republicans would be making a move of colossally idiotic proportions to hand the president a substantial legislative victory to change the subject. Furthermore, the notion that ethnic pandering will buy Latino votes is dubious at best. More certain is the catastrophic and lasting damage it would inflict on the Republican coalition. At a minimum, grass-roots conservatives will stay home in droves this November, likely costing the party the Senate. More significant would be the fracturing of the party as small-government tea partiers part ways with the big-business cronyism that would drive the GOP to this suicidal act.     Jonathan Rothenberg     New York               The GOP wasn't the majority party when Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan and both Bushes won their elections, most of which were landslides. They won because their policies were superior to those of the Democrats' and they created an expanding economy that provided millions of new jobs. Opening the gates for more H1-B visas and establishing a generous guest-worker program are both sound proposals the GOP supports because they help legal immigrants, are good for the economy and honor the rule of law. However, securing the borders is required first to prevent having to address the same illegal immigration issue 20 years from now.      Endorsing legalization without full citizenship is a nonstarter because President Obama has shown he cannot be trusted to honestly implement the law. Republicans should pass a bill dealing solely with legal immigration and leave the issue of addressing those who have broken our laws to a time when this president has left office.     Clyde Harkins     Corona del Mar, Calif.     Permanent legal residence isn't partial citizenship, nor faux citizenship. It's just legal residence, an honorable status. There's no need to muck up our discussion of the options with a term like "full citizenship."     Tom Day     Sunnyvale, Calif.      When Republicans agree to reform with a "path to citizenship," within minutes of the president's signing of such a law, the Democrats, most likely led by Sen. Chuck Schumer, will demand that we pave the path with federal largess, demand a right to vote and scold that it's because "America is unfair, forcing these recent immigrants to pay taxes yet denying them a say in how they, and we, are governed."     Business gets workers. Democrats get voters. Republicans get downsized. And the people get the government they deserve.     Royal S. Dellinger     Olney, Md.
