Key Facts   Twitter employees will initially be charged with labeling posts they determine violate Twitter policy, and their decisions will be used to teach Twitter’s automated tools to identify and label similar content across the platform, according to the company.    The labels may link curated content, like Twitter Moments, or links to trusted sources for official public health information.      The project will begin with reviewing English-language posts and later be expanded to other languages.    Twitter will also introduce a strike system to deter repeated policy violations, the company said; one strike is the equivalent of a warning, second and third strikes result in a 12-hour account lock, a fourth means a weeklong lock on the user’s account, and five strikes results in permanent suspension.        
Tangent U.S. officials have voiced concerns that misinformation and vaccine hesitancy could hurt the country’s chances of achieving herd immunity against coronavirus. Last month, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found one in three respondents said they would not or were unlikely to get a vaccine. Republicans and people without college educations were more likely to report they would go without a vaccine.  Key Background In December, Twitter announced it would remove posts containing “the most harmful misleading information” about coronavirus vaccines, just as the vaccination campaign in the U.S. kicked off. Tweets subject to removal include those that feature false claims about vaccines as population control, unsubstantiated claims about side effects or dangers and erroneous claims that coronavirus isn’t real and that vaccines are unnecessary. Other platforms, like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, put labels on posts that may feature misleading information about coronavirus or vaccines.
