Fifty-two percent of adults view Mrs. Clinton favorably in a new Bloomberg Politics poll, compared to 42 percent who view her unfavorably.                                                                                                                                                      Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible Democratic rival for Mrs. Clinton if she runs, is at a slightly positive 45 percent/43 percent favorable/unfavorable split.

Rand Paul of Kentucky, compared to 29 percent who have an unfavorable view.

On four candidate qualities people said matter to them in deciding how they vote for president — shares your values, has a vision for the future, is a strong leader and cares about people like you — Mrs. Clinton also outpaced all five Republicans by between 3 and 21 points.                                                                                                                   Overall, Mr. Romney was closest to Mrs. Clinton compared to other Republicans on those qualities. Forty-seven percent think she’s better at sharing your values, compared to 44 percent for Mr. Romney. Forty-nine percent think she’s better at being a strong leader, compared to 42 percent for Mr. Romney.                                                                                                                 Fifty-one percent think she is better at caring about people like you, compared to 40 percent for Mr. Romney; she also has an 11-point edge on that question over Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie, and Mr. Paul. And 49 percent think she is better at having a vision for the future, compared to 43 percent for Mr. Romney.                      Nearly 80 percent of voters say her having lived in Washington and worked in the federal government is more to her advantage than to her disadvantage. More than three-quarters of voters see her having served as Secretary of State for four years as an advantage, and two-thirds see her being married to former President Bill Clinton as an advantage.                      About 6 in 10 see her having a run for president before and having served in the Obama administration for four years as an advantage, while 52 percent say her having close ties to Wall Street is more to her advantage, compared to 41 percent who say her having close ties to Wall Street is more to her disadvantage.                      The poll of 1,000 U.S. adults was taken between Dec. 3-5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
