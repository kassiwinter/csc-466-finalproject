      California will drop most pandemic restrictions on June 15.      Social distancing rules will end, and businesses will be able to open at full capacity. In addition, those who are fully vaccinated will no longer have to wear masks or be discouraged from traveling.            “Something very important happens on June 15 in California,” California Health Director Mark Ghaly said Friday. “We are now at a point, given our metrics that we’ve been watching, that California is at a place where we can begin to talk about moving beyond the blueprint.” The blueprint refers to California’s system for restricting activity based on a county’s level of COVID-19 infections.

During the winter surge, cases in California hit a record seven-day average of 44,175. Cases have been declining ever since, and today the average stands at 1,320.
