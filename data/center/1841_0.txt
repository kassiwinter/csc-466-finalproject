Photo: Anna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty ImagesPresident Biden on Tuesday said that ramped-up coronavirus vaccine production will provide enough doses for 300 million Americans by the end May. Why it matters: That's two months sooner than Biden's previous promise of enough vaccines for all American adults by the end of July.The accelerated timeline also comes on the heels of pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck teaming up with Johnson & Johnson to quickly produce its one-shot COVID-19 vaccine. J&J's vaccine received its emergency use authorization last Saturday, joining Pfizer and Moderna on the vaccine market.The big picture: Coronavirus cases and deaths have ticked down since the holiday season but public health officials continue to urge Americans not to let their guards down.Yet on Tuesday, both Mississippi and Texas' governors lifted all mask distancing restrictions in their states. Local ordinances may still apply.
