WASHINGTON—A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation on Thursday that would add four seats to the Supreme Court, an initiative that has slim hopes of passage but reflects progressives’ impatience with President Biden’s cautious approach toward overhauling a court that turned to the right during the Trump administration.House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        said, “It’s a big step. It’s not out of the question.” Still, she said she had no plans to bring the bill to the House floor. Last week, Mr. Biden signed an executive order establishing a 36-member commission to report back within six months on possible changes to the Supreme Court’s membership, jurisdiction and lifetime terms. Mr. Biden appointed former Obama White House Counsel Bob Bauer and Yale law professor Cristina Rodriguez as co-chairmen of the commission; other members include many widely respected scholars, including some noted conservatives.      “We need more than a commission to restore integrity to the court,” said Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who is co-sponsoring the legislation with the House Judiciary Committee chairman,         Rep. Jerrold Nadler    of New York, and Reps.         Hank Johnson    of Georgia and         Mondaire Jones    of New York.          The sponsors announced the legislation at a Thursday press conference outside the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court declined to comment.                                         Just over a week before Election Day, the Senate confirmed Amy Coney Barrett as Supreme Court justice by a vote of 52 to 48, filling the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.                                                                                                     At Thursday’s briefing, White House Press Secretary         Jen Psaki    said President Biden would wait for the commission he appointed to do its work and “will look forward to reviewing that report when it comes to his desk.”      The sponsors acknowledged that for now the bill is unlikely to make headway now. Republicans are united in opposition to any effort that would undo the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and even many Democrats critical of the court are reluctant to prejudge the issue while Mr. Biden’s commission is at work.     “I think it’s an idea that should be considered, and I think the president is taking the right approach to have a commission to study such a thing,” Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) told reporters Thursday.      Some liberal-leaning scholars and jurists, including Justice         Stephen Breyer,    have suggested that altering the court’s makeup for ideological reasons would damage its reputation as an apolitical body.      Mr. Markey disagreed, arguing that adding four justices—thus allowing President Biden to create a 7-6 liberal majority—“will shore up the public’s confidence in the court and its legitimacy in the public’s eyes.”     Mr. Markey’s bill reflects the strenuous opposition of Democrats to former President      Donald Trump’s        three appointments to the court, and particularly to the timing of two of them. Justice         Neil Gorsuch    was confirmed by the Senate in 2017, after Republicans refused to consider President         Barack Obama’s    2016 nomination of now-Attorney General         Merrick Garland.    Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed on Oct. 26, succeeding the late Justice         Ruth Bader Ginsburg    weeks before Democratic victories in the presidential and Senate elections.

The Markey bill states only that the Supreme Court will consist of a chief justice and 12 associate justices, equal to the number of federal judicial circuits. Congress altered the number of justices on several occasions in the 19th century. Sometimes it was done in reaction to the court’s political direction, as in the 1860s after the Lincoln administration inherited a pro-Southern majority.      In 1937, President         Franklin Roosevelt    proposed adding justices to a conservative Supreme Court that had thwarted many of his New Deal initiatives. The so-called court-packing plan failed in Congress, but the court soon changed direction and began to uphold the constitutionality of aggressive federal regulation of the national economy.      Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) referred to that incident in criticizing the new bill. “Just like the last time the Democrats tried this scheme, this is an attempt to intimidate the justices into making liberal rulings,” he said.      —Eliza Collins contributed to this article.
