Donald         Trump    has chosen Indiana Gov.      Mike Pence        to be his vice-presidential running mate, teaming up with a staunch conservative and seasoned politician who balances his own freewheeling style and outsider appeal, according to senior Republicans close to the process.Mr. Trump was scheduled to announce his choice Friday in New York but postponed it “in light of the horrible attack in Nice, France.” Trump campaign officials and Mr. Trump himself on Thursday night refused to confirm the choice, but senior GOP officials and Pence supporters said they were told to prepare for Mr. Pence to be introduced. In one of the most important decisions the presumptive GOP nominee will make, the selection of the conventionally qualified, low-key Mr. Pence would mark a departure for Mr. Trump, a rare occasion on which the mercurial candidate made what was considered a cautious choice.     Naming a running mate is one of the last hurdles to his ascension as the party’s nominee next week at the Republican convention in Cleveland.         More on Capital Journal                Late Thursday, Mr. Trump’s allies in Cleveland tamped down dissident delegates in pre-convention negotiations. The convention’s Rules Committee rejected moves to allow convention delegates bound to Mr. Trump to vote for someone else.               Mr. Trump had been under pressure to announce his running-mate choice this week, in part because as a candidate for re-election as Indiana governor, Mr. Pence faces a Friday deadline for taking his name off the ballot. State law would prohibit him from appearing twice on the ballot—for governor and vice president. As of late Thursday, Mr. Pence hadn’t filed the paperwork to do so, but had until noon Friday to do it.      Some measure of suspense about Mr. Pence’s selection lingered—especially after the Friday event was postponed—because Mr. Trump has been so unpredictable throughout the 2016 campaign. But Republicans were so primed for Mr. Pence to be named that if Mr. Trump doesn’t announce him, it would be the biggest bombshell in a campaign pockmarked with them.     Mr. Pence, who flew to New York from Indianapolis Thursday, has a long government résumé and deep conservative political roots that would make him a safer choice than two other finalists for the job—former House Speaker         Newt Gingrich    and New Jersey Gov.         Chris Christie    —who mirror Mr. Trump’s combative, colorful style.     Mr. Pence could provide a kind of ballast that some Republicans think Mr. Trump needs to run a more conventional campaign. He has also been a leader on hot-button social issues—opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage—that could reassure the party’s activist base while also risking alienating independent voters or centrist Republicans.     Mr. Pence once described himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.” His fierce opposition to gay marriage, abortion and President         Barack Obama’s    health-care law has made him a star for the far right. He also has strong ties to Congress, where he was a House member for 12 years and a member of party leadership for two years before 2013, when he became governor. He could help Mr. Trump improve sometimes-tense relations with House Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.), who was close to Mr. Pence while they served in the House together.          “It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Mike Pence’s—we’re very good friends,” Mr. Ryan told reporters Thursday. Mr. Ryan said he hoped Mr. Trump would pick “a good movement conservative. Clearly, Mike is one of those.”     Joining the ticket will require some adjustments as Mr. Pence has taken positions on key issues that put him at odds with Mr. Trump. He opposed the Trump proposal to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. He has supported free-trade agreements that Mr. Trump has lambasted. And he supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Mr. Trump now criticizes.        
Related        In advance of the GOP primary in Indiana in May, Mr. Pence endorsed Mr. Trump’s rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. But he made a point of praising Mr. Trump as well. After Mr. Cruz suspended his campaign, Mr. Pence endorsed Mr. Trump and pledged to “campaign hard for the Republican nominee, because Indiana needs a partner in the White House.”     Adding a Hoosier could help Mr. Trump broaden his appeal in Midwestern swing states. However, Mr. Pence hasn’t been in a commanding position even in his home state: He has been facing a stiff Democratic challenge in his current bid for re-election as governor, which he would abandon if he runs for vice president.     As governor, Mr. Pence has presided over an economic recovery in an industrial state badly battered by the recent recession. He touts the job growth and the drop in unemployment in the state. But Democrats have charged that his pursuit of antigay social policies threatened to drive business away from the state. He signed into law legislation strengthening the state’s restrictions on abortions, even in cases when the fetus has a disability, and allowing individuals and corporations to cite religious beliefs as a defense when sued.

Mr. Pence was forced to sign a revised bill after several businesses condemned the law, including Angie’s List, which went so far as to cancel a $40 million expansion of its headquarters in Indianapolis.     —Kristina Peterson and Reid J.
