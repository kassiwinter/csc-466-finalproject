WASHINGTON—President      Donald Trump        pledged Monday to protect a popular retirement-savings program, promising to leave it untouched in the forthcoming GOP plan to overhaul taxes.Mr. Trump, in a tweet, shot down an idea that had been circulating in Washington policy circles and worrying the retirement-savings industry: limiting pretax contributions to retirement accounts. “There will be NO change to your 401(k),” the president wrote on Twitter. “This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!”     Mr. Trump’s comments point to a challenge he and fellow Republicans face as they race to write and pass a tax plan: They have ambitious targets for rate cuts and a self-imposed $1.5 trillion limit on the size of the tax cut over the decade.                                         The sacred cows of the tax code—including breaks for home mortgage interest and state and local taxes—are being challenged. WSJ's Richard Rubin explains.... with real cows.

The proposal to cap 401(k) contributions at as little as $2,400 a year and push additional savings into so-called Roth-style accounts where posttax dollars go in and money comes out tax-free in retirement was a combination of both. Much of the revenue it generated would have come from accelerating tax collections from the future into the near term.          But even a few days of chatter showed the concept’s unpopularity, especially at the $2,400 level. By foreclosing changes to 401(k) plans, Mr. Trump again positioned himself in favor of a broadly enjoyed tax break.     Mr. Trump’s decision to weigh in on a still-forming proposal showed how he can alter the legislative process, but it is Congress, not the president, that is putting the details together.      “Presidents have a right to make determinations and we ought to pay attention to it, but there are some things he shouldn’t be shooting down,” said Senate Finance Chairman         Orrin Hatch    (R., Utah), who said he didn’t like the potential 401(k) limits. “He can make his moves, but we’re going to do things up here that might be a little bit different and that might be one where we have to say we disagree, but we’ll see.”     Other parts of the tax plan that the president and congressional Republicans support would deliver significant benefits to households at the top of the income scale. Exact calculations of the plan’s impact won’t be possible until Republicans release a more specific proposal.     “I plan to hold President Trump to his word that he and congressional Republicans will not put forward any plan that taxes the retirement savings of American families,” Rep.         Richard Neal    of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Monday. “We should be using tax reform as an opportunity to ensure that every American worker has the chance at a secure retirement, rather than using the retirement savings of middle-class families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.”     Lobbyists and others in the retirement and financial-services industries who had spoken to congressional staff and committee members said last week that lawmakers are looking at proposals that would allow 401(k) participants to contribute significantly less before taxes than what is currently allowed in a traditional tax-deferred 401(k).     Those changes could have discouraged people from saving as much money, potentially limiting retirement savings and the fees that financial-services companies collect.      Rep.         Kevin Brady    (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and author of the coming tax bill, said the president’s tweet didn’t change his panel’s plans. He declined to elaborate on what retirement-policy changes were under consideration, if any.     “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee,” he said.     Once the House passes a budget, Mr. Brady is expected to announce the date when he plans to release the text of the tax bill and the date when the committee is scheduled to consider amendments and voting.     The Save Our Savings Coalition—a group that includes AARP,         American International Group Inc.    and         Northern Trust Corp.    —said it was “thrilled” by the president’s statement.      “We will continue to fight to ensure lawmakers do right by the middle class by preserving and expanding our retirement system as tax reform moves through Congress,” the group said.      A version of the idea appeared in a draft tax plan Republicans released in 2014. Separately, former President         Barack Obama,    a Democrat, proposed barring people from making additional tax-advantaged contributions once their account balance hit $3.4 million. He also would have limited the tax benefits top earners could get from deferring taxes. Not one of those proposals was adopted.     Currently, employees under age 50 can save up to $18,000 a year in a 401(k) before taxes, while those 50 or older can set aside up to $24,000. In an IRA, the annual contribution limits are capped at $5,500 and $6,500 for the same age groupings. The 401(k) limits are scheduled to rise to $18,500 and $24,500 in 2018.     Members of the House Ways and Means Committee are widely expected to release a version of the tax bill by mid-November, with the Senate Finance Committee to follow soon afterward.     They are working off a framework jointly written by the administration and House and Senate Republicans. That plan said Republicans would preserve tax benefits for retirement savings, but also left room for some changes.     “The committees are encouraged to simplify these benefits to improve their efficiency and effectiveness,” the framework said. “Tax reform will aim to maintain or raise retirement plan participation of workers and the resources available for retirement.”     It was unclear on Monday what possible changes would satisfy both the policy framework and the president’s tweet.     —Peter Nicholas and Anne Tergesen       contributed to this article.
