WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans voted to end the filibuster of Supreme Court nominations Thursday, setting the stage for the rapid elevation of Judge         Neil Gorsuch    to the high court and removing a pillar of the minority party’s power to exert influence in the chamber.Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation by the Senate, expected Friday, would return the Supreme Court to full strength for the first time in 14 months, since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of last year. It means Judge Gorsuch could be a key vote on coming cases, including the high court’s possible consideration of President      Donald Trump’s        latest executive order on immigration and visas.

The confirmation would also give the president a much-needed win, after setbacks in recent weeks on a health-care bill and the immigration order, as well as shake-ups and dissension among the White House staff. It would allow Mr. Trump to quickly put his stamp on the high court, replacing one conservative justice with another and keeping a promise to conservative activists that he made during the presidential campaign.     The battle’s aftermath appears less positive for the Senate, where it became unusually personal.               Both sides decried the increasing partisanship as Democrats mounted a filibuster against Judge Gorsuch and Republicans responded by changing Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations from now on. Senators from both parties said there could be permanent damage to a chamber that has traditionally relied on collegiality and compromise amid an otherwise polarized Washington.     “We’ve reached a point where the level of distrust is so high on this issue, we can’t even sit down and talk,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). “When the dust settles, make no mistake about it, it will have been Republicans who changed the rules on the Supreme Court. But we take no solace that history will put it on their shoulders, because the consequences for the Senate and for the future of the Supreme Court will be far-reaching.”     Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he was trying to return the Senate to an era when judicial nominees were routinely confirmed without becoming entangled in filibusters. He said that if Democrats wanted to avert a rules change, they should have dropped their filibuster.     “This is the latest escalation in the left’s never-ending judicial war—the most audacious yet—and it cannot and it will not stand,” Mr. McConnell said.      It is too early to tell exactly how the rule change will play out. Mr. Trump could find it easier to put conservative nominees on the court if more vacancies emerge while he is in office. But if the 2020 election brings a Democratic president and Senate, the change could benefit Democrats.     In a showdown on the Senate floor that unfolded over 2½ hours Thursday, Republicans fell five votes short in their efforts to end the Democratic filibuster, which would have required 60 votes. Mr. Schumer pleaded with Mr. McConnell not to eliminate the filibuster, while Mr. McConnell stared impassively ahead.     The majority leader proceeded to trigger the rules change, a move sometimes called the “nuclear option” because it upended a decadeslong Senate tradition. In a 52-48 vote along party lines, Republicans ratified Mr. McConnell’s motion.     The bitterness over the Supreme Court vacancy started long before Thursday’s maneuvering. After the death of Justice Scalia, President         Barack Obama    nominated Judge         Merrick Garland     to fill the seat in March of last year. Mr. McConnell declined to consider the nomination during the last year of the president’s term, saying voters should have input through their selection of the next president. The Democrats’ anger over that maneuver pervaded the debate over Mr. Gorsuch, who sits on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.

Democrats at the time were frustrated that GOP leaders were blocking many of Mr. Obama’s appointees.     “Everybody took the easy way out,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) “Harry Reid took it in 2013. Mitch McConnell took it in 2017.”     Some senators suggested comity wasn’t dead in the chamber. A small group, led by Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware, had mounted a failed effort to broker a compromise, and Mr. Coons noted Thursday that several groups of senators from both parties were expected to visit countries overseas during the coming congressional recess.     “You travel together enough, and it begins to rebuild the connective tissue that has so badly frayed here,” he said.     The battle over judicial confirmations goes back decades, with the acrimony seemingly only to intensify and party leaders citing instances—many of them forgotten by most voters—in which they say the other side crossed a line.     Mr. McConnell on Thursday began by citing a 1969 battle over Nixon nominee Clement Haynsworth, depicting the Democrats as the offenders in all cases. “All this history matters,” he said.     Mr. Schumer said Thursday’s fight was the culmination of that history. “Wherever we place the starting point of this long twilight battle over the judiciary, we are now at its ending point,” he said.     There is no indication that the filibuster for legislation, rather than nominees, would come to an end. But both leaders bemoaned its demise for presidential appointments.     “The 60-vote threshold in the Senate is the guardrail of our democracy,” Mr. Schumer said. “When our politics veer too far to the right or to the left, the answer is not to dismantle the guardrails and go over the cliff, but to turn the wheel back to the middle.”     —Natalie Andrews and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
