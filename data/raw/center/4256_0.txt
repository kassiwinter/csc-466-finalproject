WASHINGTON—President Trump defended the White House official who issued an order that the warship USS John S. McCain be “out of sight” during his visit to Japan, calling it “well-meaning,” but denied knowing about it in advance.Speaking to reporters Thursday as he left Washington for Colorado, Mr. Trump said of the White House request issued earlier this month: “I didn’t know a thing about it. I would never have done that.” The president repeated his previous criticisms of the late senator and didn’t apologize for the directive, saying that the official who ordered the warship concealed “did it because they thought I didn’t like him.”        
Related        “They thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of         John McCain,    ” he said. “I was very angry with John McCain because he killed health care,” he said, referring to a critical vote the Republican cast in 2017 that blocked the GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way shape or form.”               The president doesn’t know who issued the request, an administration official said.     Mr. McCain died last August at age 81 from a brain tumor.     The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that in a May 15 email to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official outlined plans for the president’s arrival that he said had resulted from conversations between the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy. In addition to instructions for the proper landing areas for helicopters and preparation for the USS Wasp—where the president was scheduled to speak—the official issued a third directive: “USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.”     “Please confirm #3 will be satisfied,” the official wrote.     The email from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official was between lower-level military personnel, a U.S. military official said. It was triggered by a directive from the White House, and White House officials and advance team staff on the ground in Japan ordered the moves directly to military officials there, military officials said.     Initial efforts to obscure the ship’s name were under way by lower-level officials until more senior naval officials—including Vice Adm. Phillip Sawyer, who commands the Seventh Fleet—and naval officers in Japan and Hawaii realized what was being undertaken and stopped it.     “It didn’t pass the sniff test,” said one military official, explaining why the more senior officers ended the effort.     Acting Defense Secretary         Pat Shanahan    was aware of the concern about the presence of the USS John S. McCain in Japan and approved measures to avoid what officials believed might be a disruption to the president’s visit, a U.S. official said. While traveling in Indonesia on Thursday, Mr. Shanahan said of the concerns: “What I read this morning was the first I heard about it,” he said.     Mr. Trump has said he intends to nominate Mr. Shanahan as his permanent defense secretary. Senators plan to ask him in his confirmation hearing about what he knew of the request to move the USS John McCain, congressional aides said. One aide said the episode raised concerns about Mr. Shanahan’s leadership abilities and whether he would be able to effectively push back against the president.     Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, a Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for a “full investigation into who ordered it and what occurred.” Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the panel, called the request “disgraceful” and “beyond petty.”              Meghan McCain,    Mr. McCain’s daughter, wrote on Twitter: “Nine months since he passed, Trump won’t let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.”     Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Arizona senator, both before and since his death. In addition to criticizing his health-care vote, Mr. Trump has called Mr. McCain—who was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years in Vietnam—“not a war hero” and complained that he wasn’t thanked for giving him “the kind of funeral that he wanted.”     The USS John S. McCain—which was stationed at the same naval base where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday aboard the USS Wasp—is being repaired after a 2017 collision that killed 10 sailors and tore a hole in the left rear side of the destroyer.     As a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr. McCain endured beatings and solitary confinement while refusing to accept Vietnamese offers of early release on the ground that it would undermine the morale of others who lacked Mr. McCain’s connections. Mr. McCain was the son and grandson of admirals, and his father had been promoted to the position of commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific theater.     In July 2018, a month before Mr. McCain’s death, Secretary of the Navy         Richard Spencer    formally added Mr. McCain as a namesake of the USS John S. McCain, which had been named for his father and grandfather after it was launched in 1994. Mr. McCain said at the time that he was “deeply honored.”     The White House’s request to move the warship has brought scrutiny to the White House Military Office, a vital but typically anonymous cog in the executive branch bureaucracy.     The office is headed by Rear Adm. Keith Davids, who previously served as the office’s deputy director. Mr. Trump elevated the office’s last director, Daniel Walsh, to serve as White House deputy chief of staff of operations in July.     The White House Military Office provides medical, transportation and communications services for the president, including support for when he travels. The office also ensures that the so-called nuclear football—the briefcase that allows the president to authorize a nuclear attack—accompanies the commander in chief during his travels. Members of the office are required to be close to the president at all times.     The White House on Thursday declined to answer questions about who within the military office had pushed for the USS John McCain to be hidden.     The office at times came under scrutiny during previous administrations. In 2009, during the Obama administration, a Boeing 747 presidential aircraft was dispatched—with a jet fighter escort—to the Statue of Liberty in New York to get fresh glamour shots of the plane, terrifying onlookers who believed the photo shoot was a terrorist attack.     Louis Caldera, a former secretary of the Army who ran the military office at the time, took the blame. “While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it’s clear that the mission created confusion and disruption,” he said. “I apologize and take responsibility for any distress that flight caused.”     —Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.
