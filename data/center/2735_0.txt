WASHINGTON—A bipartisan group of 14 U.S. senators in 2005 ended a bruising fight over federal judgeships with a compromise agreement that stopped GOP leaders from changing the chamber’s rules for confirming Supreme Court nominees. The country’s increasing political polarization in the intervening years has hardened the stances of both Senate Democrats, who said this week they had enough votes to mount a filibuster to block a vote on Judge Gorsuch under the current, decades-old rules, and Republicans, who are expected on Thursday to permanently change the chamber’s rules to confirm the GOP president’s pick.     “The whole environment has dramatically changed,” said Sen.         John McCain    (R., Ariz.), a member of the so-called Gang of 14 that averted a rules change in 2005.                                         The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday approved along party lines Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, and Democrats plan to filibuster the nomination on the Senate floor. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why it matters the confirmation has become a partisan brawl.

One party moving unilaterally to change the rules is so contentious, it is referred to as “the nuclear option.” It would leave the minority party without any ability to block nominees and enable the president to cater to his or her party’s ideological extremes if the Senate is controlled by the same party.      “There’s a variety of reasons” for the shift, Mr. McCain said, “none of it good.”     Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) said: “There’s no doubt we are moving into dangerous territory and we’re putting ourselves in a position where if you’re ever in the minority party, nobody has to talk to you.”

Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) took to the Senate floor and spoke in protest of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination for more than 15 hours until Wednesday morning. During the night, Mr. Merkley railed against a rules change. The effort, though largely symbolic, is the closest approximation to a talking filibuster that can be found in the modern Senate.     Congressional experts said this week’s expected Senate showdown reflects a widening gulf on Capitol Hill between the prevailing Republican and Democratic ideologies, as well as fewer centrist lawmakers on either side of the aisle.     Before the 2010 election, there were 54 Blue Dog Democrats, a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats. This year, there are 18, including seven lawmakers who joined Congress this year.     Only three members of the Gang of 14 who took action in 2005 are still in Congress, after several lost re-election bids. In addition to Mr. McCain, they are: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and         Lindsey Graham    of South Carolina, both Republicans.     “The country is more divided, and it becomes very difficult to be someone who brokers a compromise,” Ms. Collins said on Tuesday. “People on the far left and the far right are energized and putting a lot of pressure on members.”     Republicans and Democrats are now further apart ideologically on most issues.     The parties used to have strong internal, regional divisions, particularly between Northern and Southern Democrats, said Keith Poole, a political-science professor at the University of Georgia. The party’s composition began to change after the passage of civil-rights legislation in the 1960s, as Southern voters abandoned conservative Democrats for Republicans.     Mr. Poole, whose research has studied every congressional roll-call vote since 1789, said lawmakers’ votes now fall largely along only one spectrum ranging from liberal to conservative, rather than also dividing along regional lines, making bipartisan compromises harder to achieve.     “That’s what’s so distinctive and dangerous about the modern era,” Mr. Poole said. “This is the first time when the two parties do not have any regional divisions within them.”      The rise in partisanship has fed an escalating feud between the parties over how to use the Senate’s procedural tools to keep the other side in check.     Democrats, who were in the Senate minority when then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, was in office, sought to block a set of Mr. Bush’s judicial nominees before the Gang of 14 agreement defused the tension.     “The parliamentary arms race between the parties has just continued since 2005,” said         Sarah Binder,    a senior fellow specializing in Congress at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. “Minorities exploit the rules and majorities find new ways to restrict those new avenues.”     Later, when Republicans were in the minority, their opposition to some of the judicial and executive nominees advanced by then-President         Barack Obama,    a Democrat, helped push Democrats, led by former Sen.         Harry Reid    of Nevada, to change the chamber’s rules in 2013.     That change enabled the Senate to approve lower-court and executive nominees with a simple majority.     Then last year, Republicans, back in control of the Senate, declined to hold a hearing for         Merrick Garland    , Mr. Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court after Justice Antonin Scalia died. That stoked anger among liberal voters, who pressed Democratic senators this year to oppose Judge Gorsuch. The pressure from Democratic voters also was driven by resistance to Mr. Trump’s early actions in office, most notably on immigration.      Mr. Schatz of Hawaii said, “This is like a troubled relationship where everybody has a grievance and everybody has a little bit of a reason to be angry, but the question becomes, what do we do next?”      Still, lawmakers from both parties say there is no appetite now for changing the 60-vote threshold for procedural hurdles on most legislation.     GOP lawmakers have said Mr. Reid’s decision to change the rules in 2013 paved the road for the expected rules change later this week.     The consequences of the 2013 rules change became evident this year, when Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees, many of whom were contentious, cleared the Senate often along largely partisan lines.     None of Mr. Obama’s cabinet nominees in his first term garnered more than 31 no votes.     By contrast, so far, six of Mr. Trump’s nominees have drawn more than 40 no votes, with four drawing 47 and one drawing 50—prompting the first ever tiebreaking vote by a vice president on a cabinet nomination.     Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has found ways to skirt the current rules requiring most bills to secure 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles.     Before the health-care bill collapsed in the House, Republicans had hoped to advance the legislation without needing any Democratic votes in the Senate, by taking advantage of a procedural shortcut tied to the budget. Meanwhile, both chambers have been passing measures under the Congressional Review Act permitting them to roll back with a simple majority some rules passed by Mr. Obama’s administration.     —Natalie Andrews and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
