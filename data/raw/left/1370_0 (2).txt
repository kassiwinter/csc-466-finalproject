You speak a loud and pompous game. Please DO enumerate all those many specific stances on which you agree with "us".
Put up, or shut up and retreat back into your rabbit hole.    	September 3, 2014 02:05 pm at 2:05 pm |          	rs????
@Tampa Tim ?? – So working with allies and building a coalition to combat ISIS and tea baggers is not a sound foreign policy? The Bush Doctrine was the main reason for ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Take some responsibility, instead of blaming your failures on democrats. _________________ Blame it on Bush ain't going to work anymore. Its time for Obama to start earning his pay. Nobody on the international stage respects Obama. Just take a look at video when Obama and Putin are shown together. Putin's body language toward Obama reflects utter contempt and disrespect.
_____________________________
Speaking of the "reset button" mentality. Really? So Bush blew up Iraq, but now it's Mr. Obama's fault? The resulting civil way, the 120,000 civilian deaths, the 2 million refugees, the inept US installed government-all wiped clean?
Meanwhile, give up on your junior psychobabble. The economic sanctions are biting- much more than when Bush dreamily looked into Putin's eyes and handed him Georgia on a platter.

Oh please. Let's see....
-Teatroll racists crying "you're the REAL racist",
-the fundamentalist conservative Christian nutjobs weeping about a "war on Christmas" and their "religious freedom" to impose their beliefs on others being under attack,
-the perpetually paranoid gun-fetishist sovereign citizen pseudo-militia daycamp warriors and preppers wailing about "states rights" and "gubmint comin to take our guns away",
-the Teatrolls' IRS and NSA conspiracy theories and
-the rest of the miasma of RWNJ victimhood claims (including delusions of widespread voter fraud and the white fright fueled assumptions that President Darky is out to brown up the country with illegals in order to take it away from its rightful whiteful rulers), etc.
Between all that, the GOP/Teatroll self-pity machine has yet to fail over the past 6 years at finding ways to build its own crosses. They're practically nailing themselves to them, wondering desperately how to get the nail thru the other hand once the first one is finished. I'm surprised I don't see more of them wearing tinfoil hats that they've origami'd into crowns of thorns to complete the ensemble.

I had agreed with them on one occasion, and they unanimously called me liar for simply telling the truth.
As I recall, one of them had said something about the Republicans being fiscally responsible, which is why America voted for them to control the House. Well, I pointed out that the Tea Party House has totaled up the largest deficits in U.S. history. They're what, something like close to $4 trillion in the red, if not more? They didn't like that at all.

I cried "uncle" last Friday morning. Fact is, I blame myself for getting dragged into this nonsense, and utter nonsense it is. What do we get after the holiday break? Freaking Glenn Beck. 
That being said, I'm glad I caught up with you: I'm out of here. Permanently, my friend. It has become beyond absurd arguing whatever CNN has up its sleeve for us to argue amongst ourselves day after day. 
With that I give CNN my final "hurrah" for Aqua Buddha / Mr. Ben Ghazi 2016 ... !    	September 3, 2014 02:16 pm at 2:16 pm |          	SOUTHERN HOTTIE@ Lynda/Minnesota:

There are things to report on for sure, but CNN has to wait until both conditions for reporting are met (a) Obama says something about the issue and (b) the GOP/Teatrolls say something about Obama saying something about the issue. Only then are the pre-requisites for false equivalency met.    	September 3, 2014 02:31 pm at 2:31 pm |          	smith@Rudy-There are many different veiwpoints on what a political independent means. Example, some consider a person who is not engaged in politics at all an indpendent. Some (like myself) consider an independent as a person with no party affiliation and is driven by issues and stances and wether they are right or left has no bearing on the stance. The big difference between a moderate and a independent is a moderate is still part of a political party.    	September 3, 2014 02:45 pm at 2:45 pm |          	tom lsmith
@The Real Tom P-I agree with some issues or stances in both parties. However, the lefties on here only chime in or take notice when I bash a left stance or issue. When I speak on issues like being pro-choice or the right being driven by religon nothing but silence.

You should read the comments from yesterday. I am a rwnj according to them even though I laid out at least a half dozen positions on the dem side yet Rudy continues on...    	September 3, 2014 02:53 pm at 2:53 pm |          	smith@Tom P-I`ve explained this before. Most of the time (not all) I start out with a comment not directed towards at anyone on here. 99% of the time that comment is responded to by the left posters on here and then I respond back.

@The real tom p-Btw, My first comment was not an attack on either side but yet who chimes in? The left posters not the right. Sounds like you have the same mindset like others on here. If your not a liberal your a rwnj or if your not a conservative your lwnj. =========================================================== My, my. How forgetful you've become. Everyone watched you distance yourself from the tag "moderate", smith. You made it abundantly clear that you are as far from being moderate as possible. You made it unmistakably clear that you are nearly the opposite of "moderate." Let's not pretend, shall we?
=====
I have been saying this for weeks yet Rudy continues equating a "moderate" with an "independent" and uses those terms interchangeably. Rudy! A moderate is someone that is not that passionate about their political positions. An independent can care very deeply about their political positions but do not subscribe wholly to one side or the other. Do you understand the difference???? You are far too intelligent to act this ignorant and continue on with your meme.    	September 3, 2014 02:56 pm at 2:56 pm |          	HonestlyHmm…Let’s see which part of this message makes it though the moderators for CNN.
I might vote for a republican if my greed outweighed my compassion for others or if I wanted to direct the flow of money to support a selfish agenda without the filter of oversight from government regulations because who wants to be held accountable; I may get caught doing something WRONG!
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth (2 Corinthians 13:5-8).    	September 3, 2014 02:56 pm at 2:56 pm |      	« Previous
