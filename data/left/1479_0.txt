The impromptu celebrations for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris after the marathon presidential election could very well have harmed the new president’s goal of taming the coronavirus pandemic, Bay Area epidemiologists said.Corks popped in the Bay Area and across the nation after the two ended President Trump’s four-year reign, but it was pretty clear from television crowd shots that social distancing was not foremost on the minds of the shouting, chanting, singing revelers, some of whom even snuck in hugs and kisses.       “It’s going to be a concern, particularly in situations where alcohol is involved and there is risky behavior,” said Robert Siegel, an infectious-disease specialist at Stanford University, referring to a tendency in crowds not to stay 6 feet apart or, in some cases, wear masks. “Basically the virus doesn’t care what your political persuasion is, so the same rules apply that have applied all along.”         The danger of contracting the coronavirus is particularly high, Siegel said, because the infection rate has surged to new records across the country. Sunday was the fifth straight day of more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases in the United States, which is also nearing the ignominious milestone of 10 million cases since the pandemic began.         California managed to tamp down the disease, but it is still around, ready to strike and infections are on the rise, though not as sharply as in many other states.         In a crowd, Siegel said, all it takes is one person to send airborne droplets circulating.         “If you have a big celebration, the likelihood that you will have one person who is particularly contagious who will spread it to many people is much higher,” Siegel said. “When people’s guards get down, when people are celebrating, yelling, singing, these contribute to superspreading events.”            The idea that these celebrations could make things worse for President-elect Biden was not lost on the medical community.         “Dear anyone currently sober enough and willing to pay attention to me: Please resist the urge to congregate in large crowds,” Ethan Weiss, an associate professor in the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the UCSF School of Medicine, tweeted during the height of the partying. “I think it is what Joe and Kamala would want. But really who cares. It’s the right thing to do.”         Large gatherings appear to have spread the virus in the past. One of the most notorious superspreader events was the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in mid-August. By early September, the Associated Press had traced 290 coronavirus infections across 12 states to the event, and other researches estimated the true number was vastly higher.         The number of coronavirus cases in California exploded in June and July after Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the state, but there is disagreement about whether it was that or the fact that an increasing number of businesses had reopened after shelter-in-place orders were relaxed.         The Sept. 26 gathering in and around the White House Rose Garden to announce the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court probably infected numerous people, possibly including the president.         On Sunday, President Trump’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, compared criticism of the Rose Garden event with the comparative leniency displayed by Democrats during the weekend celebrations.            “Where is @JoeBiden calling on the massive Super Spreader events held in his name to end?” McEnany tweeted.         Dr. George Rutherford, a UCSF epidemiologist, said that, unlike the Rose Garden event, most of the celebrants over the weekend were wearing masks, which could be a key factor in reducing infections.         “The hope is that we won’t pay a price for it later,” Rutherford said. “Getting into a large crowd is not recommended. It’s understandable, but it is the better part of valor to avoid big crowds like that, especially if you are older.”         Peter Fimrite is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
