Joel Benenson, the pollster for Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, is defending a controversial TV ad released by the campaign that has been panned by political pundits and campaign operatives on both sides of the aisle.“I’m confident that the ad is effective and working and is consistent with the strategy of our ads in this campaign that depicts Greg Abbott as an insider repeatedly siding with insiders and against average Texans," Benenson, who served as President Obama's chief pollster in the 2008 and 2012 elections, said in an interview with the Texas Tribune Sunday.The 30-second spot opens with a picture of an empty wheelchair and briefly details the accident that left Davis' GOP rival Greg Abbott paralyzed from the waist down."A tree fell on Greg Abbott. He sued and got millions. Since then, he's spent his career working against other victims," the ad's narrator says. "Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb. He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a background check on a sexual predator."Many critics have insisted that the ad unfairly uses Abbott's disability against him.“This ad is not about Greg Abbott in a wheelchair,” Benenson told the Tribune. "This ad is about Greg Abbott’s behavior and actions with other victims after he had his opportunity and rightly sought justice and received a substantial amount of money.”Davis has trailed Abbott by double digits for much of the race.
