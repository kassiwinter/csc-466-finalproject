                                                                                                                                         Progressive policies are great: That’s the gist of what President     Obama will suggest during Tuesday’s State of the Union speech,   according   to various leaks, analyses and outright guesses.                                                                                                                                                      The focus on a “course correction” and return to a focus on     progressivism, as The Daily Caller describes it, comes amid a long-term     economic lag that is being answered by Democrats and the White  House   with a call for more tax increases. By comparison, Mr. Obama   highlighted in  his last major speech — January’s inaugural address —   on social  policy  and equal rights for gays.                                                                                                                                                      Meanwhile, the White House said Sunday the president is due for more     campaign-type activities, starting with a Wednesday kickoff on a    public relations push on “strengthening the economy for the middle    class and those striving to get there,” The Daily Caller reports.                                                                                                                                                         NBC reports similarly. Mr. Obama’s speech is going to be more     of the same of the past four years and promise boosts in jobs and  the   economy — but with a ramped-up progressive tone that targets  the  middle  class.
