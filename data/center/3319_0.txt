Hundreds of thousands of young people and their supporters gathered Saturday in rallies from California to Connecticut to demand stricter gun laws in America.      In the aftermath of the shooting—the worst school shooting since 2012, when 26 children and staff were gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn.—students in Parkland began mobilizing a gun-control movement to try to prevent future school shootings. Last week, an estimated 1 million students walked out of schools across the U.S. in a 17-minute-long protest against government inaction on gun control and for school safety. In response to the massive outpouring for gun-control, pro-gun advocates held demonstrations to coincide with the March for Our Lives. A group called Defend the Second Amendment rallied in cities including Los Angeles and Boston, which organizers say opposes “bans on so-called assault rifles.” Washington, D.C.                                                                                                                                                      Students came from across the country, in groups large and small—traveling by car, train and plane—to rebuke their lawmakers for failing to adequately address gun violence. Throughout the day, hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied along Pennsylvania Avenue, the thoroughfare connecting the White House and the Capitol building. Marchers packed in across many city blocks, brandishing signs and chanting—but unable to actually march because of the overwhelming turnout. Sarah Pepe, from Lakewood, Ohio, said her school principal permitted students to host an assembly to honor the students who died in the Parkland shooting, but told them not to make it political. “So we said, screw that, let’s get a bus, let’s get as many people as we can, let’s go down to this march and use our voices,” she said. Sarah and her friends raised $6,200, chartered a coach bus, purchased 52 matching red bandannas and set off at midnight for Washington. The event included a lineup of performances by pop stars, including Ariana Grande and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” star, who performed for protesters.                                                                                                                                                               Emma Gonzalez,     one of the most visible Parkland students, gave a speech in which she enumerated all the things her slain classmates wouldn’t be able to do, before observing several long minutes of silence. She took the stage for precisely six minutes and 20 seconds, the amount of time it took for the gunman to carry out the shooting. The marchers hoped to display a show of generational force: young people united in the conviction that the adults have failed them and something must change. “I knew, when I wasn’t surprised anymore that the shootings were happening and the mourning became regular, I needed to take action,” said Aurora Allen, who came to Washington with her mother for the first time from Sandy, Utah. At the National Rifle Association headquarters in Fairfax, Va., Alfred Jackson, a 62-year-old minister who also works at the Ron Brown High School in Washington, and his wife were the only protesters. He said he was worried about gun violence in the black community. “I am preaching against the influence of the NRA,” he said. —Michelle Hackman and Chris GordonBoston                                                                                                                                                      Some high-school students left their homes in Connecticut at 6:15 a.m. to travel to a Boston march and rally that drew more 50,000 people, according to an estimate provided by the mayor’s office. Yarelis Puello, a 17-year-old who took a train from Lawrence, Mass., had never protested anything before today. She said the Parkland shooting compelled her to press for safer schools. “I wanted to become a voice for those who had lost their voice,” she said. At the starting area, outside Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in the Roxbury neighborhood, teenagers chanted “Enough!” and “Not in our streets! Not in our schools!”                                                                                                                                                      Kailey Ego, a 15-year-old from Griswold, Conn., said her church youth group organized some buses to come to the march. “I’m just really moved by how all the kids are getting together,” she said, while gripping a handmade sign that stated, “I go to school to get A’s, not PTSD.” The march ended roughly 2 miles away at Boston Common. —Jennifer LevitzAtlanta                                                                                                                                                      Tens of thousands of gun-control supporters gathered under overcast skies Saturday outside the Center for Civil and Human Rights. By 11 a.m., a crowd of students and adults filled an area in front of the museum and spilled into a closed street. More people lined the sidewalk along Centennial Olympic Park Boulevard. Many carried signs, including “It’s not a moment, it’s a movement” and “ENOUGH! Remember in November,” a reference to coming midterm congressional elections. Many signs were critical of the National Rifle Association. Democratic          Rep. John Lewis,     the famous civil-rights activist whose district includes Atlanta, urged the crowd to vote in November against elected officials who didn’t support stricter gun laws. “Get out there and send those folks home who cannot vote against guns,” he said as the crowd cheered.                                                                                                                                                      After the speeches, the crowd marched to the nearby state capitol. Nia Hemphill, 18 years old, who attends high school in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross, said someone made a threat at her school recently and she decided it was time to start protesting. She participated in the recent national school walkout, despite threats of suspension from her school, and came with a friend to Saturday’s march. “Direct activism is the way for change,” she said. “This is what we have to do as a generation.” —Cameron McWhirterChicago                                                                                                                                                      Thousands gathered at a park just west of downtown Chicago on a cold and windy day. Many traveled from suburbs of the city or from other parts of Illinois to march for more gun control. Those in the crowd included stilt walkers and jugglers, and many held signs decrying proposals to arm teachers and insisting children be kept safe in schools and on the street. Speakers remembered their friends and classmates who had been killed in the city, and spoke of gun violence as a problem not just in Parkland, Fla., but in some neighborhoods in their own city. Many attendees said they came to speak out against violence in their own Chicago neighborhoods. Arianna Cardenas, 16, remembers growing up in Little Village, a Chicago neighborhood where gangs are prevalent, and hearing gunshots when she was playing outside.                                                                                                                                                      “I don’t have the luxury of going outside,” she said. “I want to explore my city and my neighborhood. I’m tired of living in fear.” Zoe Hovde, a 15-year-old from Sidney, Ill., a conservative downstate town two hours south of Chicago, woke up at 5 a.m. to drive to the city with her father and attend the march. “I’ve lost friends over my activism on this issue,” she said. “But it comes to a point where enough is enough.” —Shibani MahtaniNew York City                                                                                                                                                      In New York, organizers estimated hundreds of thousands of people marched alongside Central Park. A group of seven classmates from Renaissance High School for Musical Theater in the Bronx said they wanted to see tougher gun laws. Kiara Chavez, 18, said the shooting in Parkland reminded her of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which happened when she was 13. “It’s always the same thing. Nothing has changed,” she said. The debate about gun violence resonated with Ms. Chavez and her classmates, who said they know other students who have been shot. “We could be next,” she said. “In school or out, we could be shot.”                                                                                                                                                      Christopher Gardner said he wants to see assault rifles banned. The 34-year-old marched Saturday with some of his colleagues from the Administration for Children’s Services, a city agency where he works with children going through the criminal-justice system. Mr. Gardner said he sees through his work how children who don’t have enough after-school programs to keep them busy or appropriate outlets for their anger can turn to violence. “When I go in my community, I speak to the kids as well, which is a protest in and of itself, right?” said Mr. Gardner, a Bronx resident. “It doesn’t take you having to come out with hundreds of thousands of people to protest. That kid that you stop and speak to, that’s helping. It has to start somewhere.” —Kate KingLos Angeles                                                                                                                                                      Thousands came to downtown Los Angeles to march toward City Hall, the main rally of several organized around the city and California. Outside City Hall they listened to speeches by Mayor Eric Garcetti, student activists and celebrities. Crowds chanted, “Not one more!” and “This is what democracy looks like!” Families came. School and church and synagogue groups came. Many schoolchildren came, saying they were marching to show support and admiration for the Parkland students, and because they were scared their schools might be next.                                                                                                                                                      “My mom has made a safety plan for us. You don’t know anymore what will happen when you go to school,” said Lulu Notaro, 13 years old. Her friend, Lila Allen, said students at her middle school started a group called the Never Again Club that meets every week now to talk about gun control. “At such a young age, we never thought we’d be responsible for such an issue,” said Ms. Allen, 12. “But we have to be active because it’s our own lives at stake.” Parents, some who said they have hesitated to protest in the past, said they were motivated by the energy and passion of their children. “They are young and idealistic enough to stand up to the politicians, in a way maybe some of us aren’t,” said Ben Platt, who was marching with his son Miles, 14, and wife, Robin. “It feels like this group of kids—their community and their friendships—they matter. They’re not gonna take it anymore.” —Nour Malas                                                                                                                                                     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
