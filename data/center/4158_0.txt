WASHINGTON—A lawyer for President Trump said that House Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns flouts constitutional constraints and should be rejected by the Internal Revenue Service.In a letter to the Treasury Department’s top lawyer, attorney William Consovoy began laying out a legal case that the Trump administration could use to refuse the congressional request. Mr. Consovoy argued there are limits to a 1924 law that requires the IRS to turn over any tax returns sought by         Rep. Richard Neal    (D., Mass.), chairman of the House’s tax-writing committee. “If the IRS acquiesces to Chairman Neal’s request, it would set a dangerous precedent,” Mr. Consovoy wrote to Treasury Department General Counsel Brent McIntosh. “Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.”     Mr. Trump broke a four-decade tradition among presidents and major-party candidates in 2016 when he refused to disclose his tax returns. He sometimes has said he would release his returns once audits are complete, and he sometimes has said that no one cares about his taxes.                Mr. Neal on Wednesday used his power to turn the yearslong rhetorical fight over Mr. Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns into a procedural and legal case. Mr. Neal is seeking six years of the president’s personal returns and six years from some of Mr. Trump’s business entities.      The lawmaker also asked the IRS for details about any audits of Mr. Trump, along with all administrative files relating to the returns.      The Treasury Department and IRS haven’t commented on Mr. Neal’s request and haven’t indicated whether they will comply. Mr. Neal asked for a response by April 10.     Under the tax code, the administration “shall furnish” any returns and records requested by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. Mr. Consovoy cites precedent to argue that the request is constrained by a requirement that it serves a legitimate legislative purpose.      Mr. Neal said he based his request on the committee’s oversight function, arguing that he has the responsibility to oversee whether the IRS is correctly auditing the president’s returns as the committee considers potential legislation.         Related        Mr. Consovoy, by contrast, suggests that the request is merely retaliation against Mr. Trump’s political beliefs, writing that it is no coincidence that Mr. Neal sent his request after getting pressure from other Democrats.      Mr. Trump’s lawyer also attempts to rebut Mr. Neal’s contention that the legislative purpose is to investigate how the IRS audits presidents. Mr. Consovoy notes that Mr. Neal asked for tax returns from before Mr. Trump took office and doesn’t ask for information about how previous presidents were audited. Other presidents released their tax returns but not any of the audit information that Mr. Neal is seeking.      The returns from before Mr. Trump took office, however, could still be under audit, meaning that the questions about pre-2016 returns may address concerns about how IRS employees are scrutinizing the president they now work for.     Daniel Rubin, a spokesman for Mr. Neal, declined to comment late Friday afternoon. Another Ways and Means Committee member responded on Twitter. “Every U.S. President released their tax returns before taking office for decades until Trump. He doesn’t care about precedent,” wrote         Rep. Don Beyer    (D., Va.). “The President’s contempt for transparency is not a legal basis to flout Congress’ explicit statutory authority. The law is clear.”     Top executive branch officials haven’t responded, either. Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    and IRS Commissioner         Charles Rettig    are scheduled to testify in the House on Tuesday.     Mr. Consovoy also asked the Treasury Department to get a formal legal opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel before turning over any information to Mr. Neal. “Caution and deliberation are essential to ensure that the Treasury Department does not erode the constitutional separation of powers,” he wrote.     If the executive branch refuses to turn over the records, Mr. Neal could issue a subpoena or begin a lawsuit against the executive branch. That would put the issue in front of federal judges, who haven’t ruled on these precise issues but could have to determine the bounds of Congress’ investigative powers.      “The statute is much more powerful than the general investigative authority of the House,” said Charles Tiefer, a former deputy general counsel for the House who is now a law professor at the University of Baltimore.     “In the past, the definition of legislative purpose was broad. But in terms of a Republican-picked judiciary, there is a new sheriff in town and they may feel like a good outcome for the case is to narrow what Congress” can do, he said.     Mr. Neal’s request on Wednesday escalated a dispute between Democrats and Mr. Trump that had been brewing since the 2016 campaign, when Democrats criticized the then-GOP nominee for failing to disclose his returns. Those returns would show his income and his charitable donations and could give the public more details about his financial ties than is available in public records.     In a 2016 debate, Mr. Trump said he would release returns “as soon as the audit is finished.” Since then, he has cited various reasons for not releasing his returns, including continuing audits of his tax returns.     “Until such time as I’m not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday.     Mr. Trump’s tax lawyers said in 2016 that the IRS had closed audits from 2002 through 2008 but were still auditing tax years 2009 and beyond. Those lawyers, Sheri Dillon and William Nelson of Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP, haven’t provided any updates about those audits since then.     No law or rule prevents Mr. Trump from releasing his tax returns while he is under audit. Doing so, however, would effectively crowdsource the audit and affect the discussions between the president’s lawyers and the IRS.
