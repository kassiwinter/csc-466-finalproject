         WASHINGTON—House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) said she doesn’t support pursuing the impeachment of President Trump, saying such a step would be too divisive and the Democratic Party should focus instead on winning back the White House in 2020.     “I’m not for impeachment,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview published Monday. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it.”      Asked about critics’ concerns about the Trump presidency, she said the country “can withstand anything. But maybe not two [Trump] terms. So we have to make sure that doesn’t happen.”                                         Both Republicans and Democrats have some incentive to work together on a plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. But the opportunity for bipartisan action is ending quickly. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

Some Democrats have called for impeachment hearings to begin immediately, before the conclusion of special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    investigation into the Trump campaign over possible collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction.     After Democrats took over the House majority this year, House committees have moved to investigate the president, his business and the administration. The House Judiciary Committee last week announced plans to request documents from dozens of associates of President Trump, including from his sons and from his longtime chief financial officer, as part of a House investigation into obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.     House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.) who would lead any impeachment hearings, has been careful to say that while he thinks Mr. Trump has committed impeachable acts, he believes any effort to impeach the president would need to be bipartisan.     The process of removing a president from office starts in the House of Representatives. Once the House launches and debates impeachment proceedings, a simple majority vote will determine whether the president is impeached and is then tried in the GOP-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required to convict and remove the president from office.      Democrats and even many Republicans believe the strategy used by the GOP-led Congress during the impeachment of former President Clinton was misguided and ultimately backfired politically, in part because it relied almost entirely on the findings of independent counsel         Ken Starr.         Party leaders have worried that Democrats could put their newly acquired House majority at risk in GOP-held districts where the president has some support. In an interview last month, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), who advises Democratic politicians, said the effort would be risky.      “He’s not going to be impeached until you get some Republicans signing on to it. So it would only be for now just kind of for show,” Mr. Reid said in the interview. “Some people believe the show would be worth it. I’m not convinced.”     Billionaire         Tom Steyer,    a major Democratic donor who has been pushing for impeachment, criticized Mrs. Pelosi for her remarks.      “Speaker Pelosi thinks ‘he’s just not worth it?’” Mr. Steyer said in a statement. “Is doing what’s right ‘worth it?’ Or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and do what’s politically convenient.”     Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
