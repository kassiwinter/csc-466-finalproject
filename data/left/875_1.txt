Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday that while he accepts the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin, Florida should reexamine its stand-your-ground law.
"I support this system," the Nevada Democrat said on NBC's "Meet The Press." "Now, I may feel differently, but I wasn't sitting as a juror, a prosecutor or a defense attorney.
Asked what he believed should happen next in the case, Reid said "this isn't over."

"I think the Justice Department's going to take a look at this. This isn't over with, and I think that's good, it's our system. It's gotten better, not worse," he said.
