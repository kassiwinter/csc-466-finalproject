The number of people seeking unemployment benefits continued to fall while those receiving them appeared to plateau, signs the U.S. labor market continues to slowly mend from the coronavirus employment shock.The ranks of Americans drawing on unemployment benefits declined slightly in the week ended May 30 to 20.9 million, the Labor Department said Thursday. So-called continuing claims remain historically high—the prepandemic record was 6.6 million in 2009—and appear to have stabilized in recent weeks after peaking in early May.          Though states continue to work through a backlog of claims, new applications for unemployment benefits have trended down since the coronavirus pandemic and related lockdowns triggered a surge in claims at the end of March. About 1.5 million applications were filed last week, compared with a peak of nearly 7 million in the week ended March 28.      “It’s fair to say that the recovery has started, but that’s not a guarantee that the recovery will continue uninterrupted,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at job site Glassdoor.                He pointed to the possibility of a second wave of coronavirus infections and a pullback in government aid as potential roadblocks to a smooth recovery.     Initial unemployment claims were down in just over half of states last week. States including Florida, Georgia and Texas saw large weekly declines.     Continuing claims, which are released with a one-week lag, fell in 34 states at the end of May.                                         Initial jobless claims fell to 1.5 million last week, though 20.9 million people are still receiving unemployment benefits, signaling a slow start to a potential recovery.

President Trump on Thursday criticized the Fed’s stance on the recovery. “The Federal Reserve is wrong so often,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. “I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021.”     New data released separately by the Fed showed the net worth of U.S. households fell sharply in the first quarter as the pandemic sent shock waves through the economy and caused equity prices to plummet. Household net worth fell 5.6% in the quarter from the previous three months to a seasonally adjusted $110.79 trillion, the Fed said. Most of the decline was attributable to a $7.8 trillion drop in the value of directly and indirectly held corporate equities, the central bank said.     As businesses reopen and some recall workers who were furloughed, the labor market appears to be picking up after millions of jobs were lost in March and April. Although unemployment is still at levels unseen in many decades, with employment down by nearly 20 million jobs since February, the jobless rate in May declined to 13.3%, and employers added 2.5 million jobs that month.     Policy debates over the pace of economic recovery are at the heart of discussions regarding the next coronavirus stimulus bill. Democrats and Republicans have been sparring over whether to extend the extra $600 a week that jobless claimants are receiving as part of a federal stimulus bill passed in late March. The expanded benefits are scheduled to expire at the end of July.     Republicans are concerned that the supplemental benefits, which give many workers more money than they were making before the crisis, will discourage people from returning to work, slowing the economic recovery. Democrats want to extend funding for the larger unemployment payments, arguing that if businesses don’t rebound quickly, the additional money will keep millions of workers afloat financially.                                         Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank has no plans to raise interest rates, and that it was committed to supporting the economy following the shock caused by the pandemic.

A recent survey by job search company ZipRecruiter found more than a third of individuals who applied for unemployment benefits after losing their jobs because of the pandemic were still waiting to receive payments. The survey was conducted June 1-4, and included 757 people who applied for benefits because of the pandemic and had logged into the job search site.     Since the pandemic hit the U.S. labor market, many state labor departments have reallocated staff from other departments and updated their decades-old computer systems with cloud-based technology to address a surge in claims.     Now, they are confronting new barriers to delivering unemployment payments. That includes the implementation of a new federal unemployment insurance program for independent contractors and self-employed people.     Nevada started accepting applications from gig and contract workers under this new program on May 16 and has struggled to deal with a surge in filings in recent weeks.         More on the Economy                A dedicated phone line meant to help determine whether individuals are eligible for the new unemployment assistance program received nearly 140,000 calls when it launched June 1, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Heather Korbulic, the department’s director, said the high call volume required the center taking the calls to restart its servers, which led to some callers being disconnected.     “This is a system that is entirely new to the state,” Ms. Korbulic said. She said Nevada is dealing with a new technology system and needed to connect the system with other data service hubs. The state also had to refine eligibility rules and work with banks to make payments. “That’s a complex undertaking, and that’s what’s been taking the time.”          Las Vegas resident Adam Kowalski, 39 years old, said he has been out of work since mid-March, when his gig work as a         Lyft    driver and social media manager dried up. He applied for unemployment assistance under the new program for gig workers on May 16 but confronted an error message in his account about a week later. He said he hasn’t been able to reach anyone for help.     “I have a little savings lined up, I’m not starving,” he said. “But if I go another month without seeing any movement, it might get to a point where ramen noodles will be my meal for the night.”

In Washington state, officials acknowledged that efforts to deal with a global unemployment fraud ring have slowed down payments for some applicants.     Washington Employment Security Department Commissioner Suzi LeVine said more than 100,000 people were still caught up in concerns about possible identity theft as of last week, many of whom are legitimate claimants. She said fraudulent claims contain increasingly convincing information and need to be dealt with by trained investigators.     “The criminals that have taken advantage of this crisis have also complicated and slowed down efforts to get payments to folks who have been waiting the longest, both here and across the country,” Ms. LeVine said.     She said on June 4 that due to fraud, it would take longer than she had anticipated to finish dealing with all of the claims from applicants who applied before May 1. The state is also holding all claims for two days before making a payment to guard against fraud.
