Gaza was calm but tense Tuesday morning as Israel and Hamas again embarked on a 72-hour cease-fire and Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Palestinian territory after a month-long campaign.Gazans ventured out onto the streets once again even though no previous cease-fire in this conflict has lasted more than a day. Horse carts and bicycles rode down the streets along with cars. At the beach, fishermen again cast their nets from the shore. A few boats were out on the water.     But the cease-fire, set for 8 a.m. local time, remained fragile. The IDF said a barrage of 20 rockets was fired into Israel around the deadline. The crash of one was heard in a hotel where foreign journalists were staying eight minutes before cease-fire was to begin. An Israeli drone could still be heard circling above Gaza City.               A Hamas-run news station reported that two houses were hit by Israelis in northern Gaza.     Israeli forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said all troops are now in the process of being pulled out from Gaza and will be deployed close to the border where they will "respond if attacked".      The first 20 minutes of the cease-fire had seen "extensive fire" from Gaza strip into Israel, but stopped short of saying the truce had been broken by Palestinian factions, Lt. Col. Lerner said.      "We will respond if attacked," he said.     U.S. officials said they were hopeful that the latest cease-fire would work.     The truce brokered by Egypt set the stage for a new round of indirect talks in Cairo between Israel and the Islamist rulers of Gaza on terms for ending the deadliest of their three conflicts in less than six years.      Both sides are under pressure to stop fighting. Israel said it destroyed more than a third of Hamas's estimated arsenal of 10,000 rockets and razed more than 30 tunnels. The fighting left Hamas in charge of a territory with severe shortages of electricity or clean water and at least 260,000 of its 1.8 million people displaced, the U.N. said.                 Related Coverage           U.S. pressure on Israel to scale back its operation and negotiate a durable cease-fire had been growing in recent days, reflecting what American officials described as the administration's shock at the number of times in which Israeli shell fire had struck U.N.-run schools where displaced Palestinian civilians sought shelter from the fighting.      In recent private meetings, the U.S. officials said they told their Israeli counterparts that the strikes—including one on Sunday in the southern city of Rafah in which Gaza health officials said 10 Palestinians were killed—made it harder for the U.S. to continue supporting and defending the broader military operation.      Since the conflict began on July 8, more than 1,800 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel said it lost 64 soldiers and three civilians.                                          An apparent airstrike hit a home in the Gaza Strip, killing an 8-year-old girl in the first minutes of a unilateral Israeli truce declared Monday.

The State Department reaction to the strike outside the U.N. shelter on Sunday was the most pointed to date. Spokeswoman         Jen Psaki    said the U.S. was "appalled by today's disgraceful shelling." U.S. officials said the wording was meant to signal to Israel that the administration has reached what American officials described as "a breaking point".     U.N. Secretary-General         Ban Ki-moon    called the strike in Rafah "a moral outrage and a criminal act."     Israel said it had launched a missile targeting militants on a motorcycle as they passed in front of the U.N. school. Shrapnel hit those inside the shelter, the U.N. said.     Israeli officials say the military takes precautions to avoid civilian casualties and has accused Hamas of using civilians as shields by operating in populated areas.

European Pressphoto Agency                                                                                                             Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    has chafed at pressure from Washington over Israel's conduct in the war, and it is unclear what impact, if any, the public and private messages conveyed by U.S. officials in recent days had on his decision-making.     Palestinian and U.N. officials said most of those killed in Gaza were civilians. But Israeli officials estimate the civilian casualty rate in the current campaign at around 50 %. The U.S. believes the percentage is closer to 70%, based on estimates from the U.N. and other organizations and evaluated by American officials.     The Obama administration welcomed diplomatic breakthrough in Cairo. "We strongly support this latest proposal for a 72 hour cease-fire and urge both parties to respect it completely," said Ms. Psaki, the spokeswoman.

The cease-fire talks in Cairo will be complicated by divergent terms set by Hamas and Israel.     Hamas said it would seek a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, an end to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the territory imposed when Hamas took over seven years ago, the release of Hamas prisoners held by Israel and international assistance in the reconstruction of Gaza.     Israel has demanded that Gaza be demilitarized requiring the unlikely cooperation of Hamas in giving up its significant arsenal.     But Egypt's mediation effort appears to have stronger backing from the Palestinian side than previous ones. Hamas rejected an Egyptian cease-fire proposal last month, saying it had not been consulted about it and that it didn't meet its chief demands for a truce.      Hamas spokesmen         Sami Abu Zuhri    and         Fawzi Barhoum    said early Tuesday that the group had agreed and would be sending a delegation out of Gaza. An official from Hamas's military wing said the group viewed this as the first step to a long-term truce with Israel.      U.S. officials, who brokered a three-day truce accord that fell apart in its first hours last Friday, said the changing circumstances gave them hope that the talks in Cairo could succeed.      Even as Israel pulled back most of its troops, Mr. Netanyahu said Monday that the country was ready to continue the military operation unless militants from Gaza stop firing rockets. Israeli officials said troops would remain massed along the border.      "The battle in Gaza continues," he said after huddling with military chief in southern Israel.      But Mr. Netanyahu's unilateral troop pullback and suspension of cease-fire talks came under criticism in Israel.      Foreign Minister         Avigdor Lieberman    told a parliamentary committee Monday that the prime minister had left Israel in a vulnerable "limbo"—without a cease-fire or a decisive defeat of Hamas.      Other Israeli officials said international criticism of Israel made it unthinkable to escalate the offensive and try to crush Hamas.     "I don't see any major military steps" ahead, said Gadi Shamni, a former commander of the military's Gaza division. "Israel lost legitimacy."     Before the temporary truce on Monday began, an Israeli airstrike in Jabalia killed an intelligence chief for Islamic Jihad, a militant group fighting alongside Hamas, according to Israel. The man,         Danian Mansour,    oversaw rocket fire at Israel, the military said.     In Jerusalem, police said a Palestinian man went on a rampage with a construction excavator, fatally striking an Israeli pedestrian and overturning a bus before a police officer shot him dead. Mayor         Nir Barkat    called it a terrorist attack. The bus driver and the only two passengers, all Israelis, were slightly injured, a medical worker said.      —Asa Fitch, Rory Jones and Jay Solomon contributed to this article.
