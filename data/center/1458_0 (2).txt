                                                  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers questions from the media about nurse Kaci Hickox's quarantine Monday.          Associated Press                                                                                                                      New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the Obama administration’s new guidelines for isolating those exposed to Ebola “incredibly confusing,” and defended the state’s stricter policy requiring quarantines for health-care workers exposed to the virus.     “We aren’t moving an inch,” Mr. Christie said during an interview on the “Today” show Tuesday morning. “Our policy hasn’t changed and it will not change.”      The Republican governor faulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for being too slow in implementing a protocol for those returning to the U.S. from Ebola-impacted nations.     Mr. Christie said that six other states, led by Democrats and Republicans, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “have joined us as well” in implementing some form of a mandatory quarantine.          “I understand that the CDC has been behind on this. Folks got infected in Texas because they got behind,” Mr. Christie said. “Governors ultimately have the responsibility to protect people in their borders.”                                                 Nurse Kaci Hickox in an isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, N.J., where she was quarantined after flying into Newark Liberty International Airport following her work in West Africa caring for Ebola patients. On Monday New Jersey officials said Ms. Hickox was being released.          Associated Press                                                                                                                 More        Mr. Christie’s decision last week to impose a mandatory 21-day quarantine has come under criticism after Kaci Hickox, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders returning from Sierra Leone last week, criticized her treatment while isolated at University Hospital in Newark over the weekend.     White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the conditions of Ms. Hickox’s quarantine were “really inhumane.” New Jersey released Ms. Hickox home to Maine Monday after Mr. Christie said that she didn’t show signs of Ebola for 24 hours.     The decision to release Ms. Hickox had nothing to do with her retaining a lawyer to fight her treatment, Mr. Christie said Tuesday.     On Monday, the CDC recommended that those at risk for developing Ebola voluntarily isolate themselves at home, and people at the highest risk stay off public transportation and away from group settings.     Mr. Christie said those policies sound “like quarantine to me.”     Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
