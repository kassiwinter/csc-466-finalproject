Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the Pennsylvania Republican presidential primary, one of five victories for the businessman on a dominant night for his presidential campaign.Trump easily defeated his rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. It wasn't his only win of the night on Tuesday. He also scored big victories in Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island and Maryland.The wins should help Trump, even as he faces a pact by Cruz and Kasich for the next round of major primaries -- Kasich has agreed to back out of Indiana, while the Cruz campaign is pulling out of New Mexico and Oregon. Their agreement aims to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the first ballot at the GOP convention in Cleveland.But as HuffPost's Scott Conroy reported earlier, the Trump campaign isn't fazed by the pact: In typical fashion, Trump pounced on the apparent confusion, tweeting, “Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician — can’t make a deal work.” Trump added that the pact, “[s]hows how weak and desperate Lyin’ Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can’t stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.” Trump’s tact of mocking the Cruz-Kasich agreement, rather than blowing a gasket over it, demonstrated the extent to which the political treaty looked more like an Axis of The Feeble, rather than a coordinated strategy with a good chance of success. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Celebrities Who Have Endorsed Trump
