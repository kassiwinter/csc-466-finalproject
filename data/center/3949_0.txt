WASHINGTON—A prolonged partial shutdown of the federal government could pinch hundreds of thousands of workers during the year-end holidays but otherwise showed little impact over its first weekend.Monday and Tuesday are federal holidays, so planned furloughs for most workers aren’t officially slated to begin for most workers until Wednesday. Critical functions like border security, federal benefits and airport operations will continue, as will mail delivery. Leaders at nine federal agencies, including the State, Transportation and Justice departments, began implementing contingency plans to prepare for an indefinite closure. About 380,000 employees will be forced to take unpaid leave, also known as furlough, while another 420,000 workers deemed essential will work without pay until funding is restored.     By Sunday, the shutdown’s effects ranged from inconvenient—an organ concert was canceled at a historic church in Mount Vernon, N.Y. that is managed by the National Park Service—to financially painful.               “I’m nervous. I’ve talked to some people who’ve already returned gifts,” said Erin Kidwell, 41, of Sandy, Ore., a federal employee for the Mount Hood National Forest. “We have a little bit of savings but it gets hard.”     She said she has two children in day care, which is expensive. But her children will lose their spot if she takes them out to conserve money.     “This is a dereliction of duty by Congress and the president, and it is forcing the men and women who safeguard our country to work for free—while hundreds of thousands more get sent home without pay,” J. David Cox Sr., the president of American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, said Saturday.     New York City Mayor         Bill de Blasio    on Saturday assured residents that all basic services of city government would continue, and said the city had reserves to get through a shutdown for a few weeks. New York City’s public housing authority and Transportation Department rely heavily on federal dollars, Mr. de Blasio said.     “There are a number of agencies here in this city that rely deeply on federal funding and will be affected if this shutdown continues for any appreciable amount of time,” he said at a press conference.              New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo    said Saturday that the state will pay $65,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open throughout the shutdown.     Congress in the past has voted to give furloughed workers back pay once funding is restored, though this isn’t guaranteed and can pinch workers with limited savings. Essential workers who remain on the job will eventually get paid, but not until the shutdown ends. Some federal contractors will face payment delays and won’t get paid for time lost during the shutdown.     The shutdown will affect agencies in different ways.     For example, the overwhelming majority of workers at the Housing and Urban Development Department would be furloughed, while many workers at the Justice and Homeland Security departments will remain on the job, according to agency contingency plans.     On Wednesday, the first working day of the shutdown, furloughed employees generally have four hours to clean out their desks, put up “out of office” notices, secure property and turn in mobile devices. After that, they aren’t supposed to send email or do any type of work until their office reopens.     Essential workers, such as air-traffic controllers, prison guards, weather-service forecasters and food-safety inspectors, will continue coming to work. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, Forest Service firefighters, border patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration workers will also keep working through any temporary closure. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe won’t be affected.     A shutdown won’t affect the U.S. Postal Service or the delivery of Social Security checks or federal retirement benefits. Some national parks may still be open to visitors, but workers will stop providing visitor services, including trash collection, campground operations and road maintenance. Visitor facilities—including restrooms—will be closed.     Departments impacted by the shutdown include Justice, Homeland Security, State, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce and Interior.     Many federal agencies and programs, including the Defense and Energy Departments, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, are fully funded and won’t be affected by the shutdown. Operations there would continue as usual.     —Richard Rubin, Katie Honan, Stephanie Armour and Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article.
