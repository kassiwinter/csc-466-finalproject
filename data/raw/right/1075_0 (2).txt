                                                                                                                                         President Obama on Thursday expressed  strong support for Senate  Democrats’ move to enact the so-called  “nuclear option” and alter  congressional rules to clear the way for  judicial and other executive  nominees.                                                                                                                                                      “Enough is enough,” the president said during remarks in the White   House press briefing room. “I’m a former senator. So is my vice   president. We both value any senator’s duty to advise and consent. It’s   important we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat   that duty of advise and consent with the respect it deserves. …  What’s  at sake here is not my ability to fulfill my constitutional  duty.  What’s at stake is the ability of any president to fulfill his  or her  constitutional duty. Public service is not a game. It is a  privilege.”                                                                                                                                                      The nuclear option changes Senate rules and eliminates the   possibility of a filibuster for presidential nominees, clearing the way   for the White House to flood the chamber with prospective officials   who, thus far, have been blocked by Republicans.                                                                                                                                                                    The Senate voted 52-48 earlier Thursday to  move forward with the  controversial change, with GOP leaders vehemently objecting and  casting the step as a power grab by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,  Nevada Democrat.                                                                                                                              The nuclear option does not extend to Supreme Court nominees, though   Republicans quickly moved to include those judicial picks and vowed   they’ll use the new rules to push through their own high-court  picks  next time a Republican occupies the White House.                                                                                                                                                                 The Senate rules fight also gives the White House the opportunity  to change the conversation away from the botched rollout of Obamacare,   which has consumed Washington for the past month. Mr. Obama, who as a senator opposed the idea of the nuclear option, said Thursday’s  step will help the gears of government work more effectively and  should end some of the gridlock that’s gripped Washington in recent  years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           “We can’t let it become normal,” Mr. Obama said of the tactic of  blocking his nominees through filibuster. “So I support the step a  majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is  doing business. More specifically, the way the Senate does business.”
