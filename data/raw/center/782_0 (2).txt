Notice a slimmer Chris Christie lately? That's because the New Jersey Governor underwent lap-band surgery for weight loss in February, and that revives the question of whether he'll run for president in 2016 -- though he says he did it for a different reason.“It’s so much more important than that,” Christie told the New York Post, saying he agreed to lap-band stomach surgery for the sake of his wife and children. “I’ve struggled with this issue for 20 years,” he said. “For me, this is about turning 50 and looking at my children and wanting to be there for them.”Christie turned 50 last September.The Republican governor's weight has often been a topic of discussion -- he is estimated to weigh approximately 300 to 350 pounds -- particularly in the context of a potential run in the 2016 presidential race.Back in December, Christie was interviewed by Barbara Walters for a special titled “10 Most Fascinating People.” Walters asked him to address those who say he is too fat to be the next president.“That’s ridiculous,” Christie answered. “I don’t know what the basis for that is.”Walters proceeded to asked about his weight and why he is so large.“If I could figure that out, I’d fix it,” Christie responded.According to a source, Christie registered for the February surgery under a false name. The surgery should promote weight loss by making him feel fuller more quickly, thanks to a silicone tube wrapped around the top of his stomach, which will restrict his food intake.An insider revealed the governor has already lost nearly 40 pounds. © Copyright IBTimes 2022.
