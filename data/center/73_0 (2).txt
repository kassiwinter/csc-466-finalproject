Prosecutors implored jurors to believe their eyes, building their case around video of Mr. Floyd lying under Mr. Chauvin’s knee for more than nine minutes. Mr. Chauvin’s defense attorney repeatedly showed clips of Mr. Floyd struggling with officers to build his case that the use of force was reasonable.      Including closing arguments, attorneys at the trial showed about 166 clips of video taken from bystanders, police body cameras, street cameras and convenience-store surveillance footage over the course of the trial, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. “This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video. You can believe your eyes,” said Steve Schleicher, a special assistant attorney general for the prosecution, focusing its case on the nine minutes and 29 seconds Mr. Floyd was held on the ground. “It’s what you felt in your gut. What you now know in your heart. This wasn’t policing. It was murder.”                                                 People demonstrated near a memorial for George Floyd in Minneapolis on Sunday.

Mr. Nelson showed videos from different officer body cameras trying to put a resisting Mr. Floyd into the car. He also showed street camera footage that showed the squad car rocking as officers struggled with Mr. Floyd inside. “A reasonable police officer would rely on his training and experience,” Mr. Nelson said. “I submit to you that the state has failed in its burden to prove Mr. Chauvin’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”                                                 Businesses throughout Minneapolis have boarded up their windows.

Mr. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. The jurors will remain sequestered until they reach a verdict or become deadlocked and can’t. In closing arguments, prosecutors used five clips of video showing Mr. Floyd begging with officers not to put him in the police car, of Mr. Chauvin ignoring requests from the crowd to provide aid to Mr. Floyd and a fellow officer who asked whether they should turn him over. They also presented autopsy photos previously presented only to the jury showing scrapes and bruises to Mr. Floyd’s face, shoulder and knuckles as he was pressed against the street.

State and city leaders have been working for months on a plan to prevent another wave of unrest, calling on National Guard troops and thousands of officers from across the state of Minnesota. Concerns over violence grew last week after a police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright when she appeared to mistake her gun for a Taser, setting off some looting of stores and several nights of protests. Many businesses throughout the city have boarded up their windows. Minneapolis schools are closed for in-person learning Wednesday through Friday in anticipation of the verdict. More than 3,000 national guardsmen were deployed throughout the city to “protect First Amendment rights and prevent damage to property,” Maj. Gen. Shawn Manke, Minnesota’s National Guard adjutant general, said at a press conference Monday afternoon. The mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis requested the additional support, which the governor approved, he said. After the jury had left to begin their deliberations, Mr. Nelson brought up the issue of whether the jury can make an independent decision, given media coverage of the trial, as well as comments from U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) over the weekend, calling for people to take to the streets if Mr. Chauvin isn’t convicted. Judge Peter Cahill said he wished politicians would stop talking about the case and said that Mr. Nelson may have grounds for an appeal. Mr. Nelson then said that the prosecution is seeking an aggravated sentence in the case and asked Mr. Chauvin if he wanted the judge or a jury to hear arguments about whether such a sentence should be imposed if he is convicted. Mr. Chauvin said Judge Cahill could decide.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSIs Derek Chauvin’s defense strong enough to absolve him of murder? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.         Earlier, Judge Cahill explained to the jurors all of the elements of each charge that need to be proven to sustain a conviction. In no case does the state have to prove that Mr. Chauvin had an intent to kill Mr. Floyd, but all the charges require proof that he caused his death. A conviction of second-degree murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Chauvin caused the death of Mr. Floyd while assaulting him by intentionally applying unlawful force without consent that resulted in substantial bodily harm. It isn’t necessary for the state to prove that Mr. Chauvin intended to inflict substantial bodily harm. The judge explained that third-degree murder requires proof that Mr. Chauvin caused Mr. Floyd’s death by committing an eminently dangerous act that was highly likely to cause death and showed a reckless disregard for human life. To convict Mr. Chauvin of second-degree manslaughter, the jurors would need to believe that it was Mr. Chauvin’s culpable negligence and reckless actions that caused Mr. Floyd’s death. Judge Cahill also included special instructions that apply to the conduct of a police officer defendant.                                                 People gathered Sunday for a rally to promote solidarity between the Black and Asian communities in Minneapolis.

For someone with no prior felony offenses like Mr. Chauvin, Minnesota sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of 128 to 180 months for the murder charges. The guidelines recommend 41 to 57 months for second-degree manslaughter. The maximum punishment for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter is 40 years, 25 and 10 years, respectively.
