                                                                                                                                         Conservatives’ rebellion against Rep. John A. Boehner fell short Tuesday, as he earned enough votes to win a third term as speaker of the House — though the contentious afternoon vote underscored the continued strain within the GOP.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Boehner received 216 votes, topping Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who earned 164. But the key contest was within the GOP, where a group of conservatives displeased with Mr. Boehner’s leadership advanced a series of alternatives.                                                                                                                                                      “This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad,” Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said as he took the gavel from Mrs. Pelosi and vowed to put the economy as the top GOP priority. He said first up will be a bunch of bills that cleared the House in the previous Congress with bipartisan support, but which died for lack of action in the Democratic-held Senate.                                                                                                                                                                    Before handing the gavel over to Mr. Boehner, Mrs. Pelosi laid out Democrats’ agenda, saying they will immediately introduce legislation to raise taxes on the wealthy and businesses, as well as try to boost spending on infrastructure. She also said Democrats will focus on voting rights.                                                                                                                              “We invite our Republican colleagues to join us,” she said, drawing scattered applause from her Democratic colleagues, who seemed to sense that their agenda has little chance of advancing in the GOP-led Congress.                                                                                                                                                                 Rep. Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican, earned 12 votes, which while well short of threatening Mr. Boehner was the largest single challenge to a speaker in years. Rep. Louie Gohmert, Texas Republican, earned three votes of support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Across the Capitol, meanwhile, the Senate quickly finished swearing in the latest class of senators and proceeding with other ceremonial business, including affirming Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, as the president pro tempore without any objections.                                                                                                                              The House vote was more contentious — though the speakership was never in much doubt, despite conservative pressure groups’ efforts to rally opposition from outside the Capitol.                                                                                                                              Mr. Boehner’s 216 votes was slightly less than the 220 he won in the last go-around in 2013, but because of absences, the number of members voting was less, too. So his percentage of support actually increased slightly.                                                                                                                   He also won over lawmakers who had opposed him before, such as Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico, but lost support of others.                                                                                                                 Rep. Jeff Duncan, South Carolina Republican, voted for fellow South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.                      “A fresh start often requires change, and I believe that change should start with the election of a new speaker,” Mr. Duncan said in a Facebook post defending his vote, saying he intended it to send a message of objection to President Obama, who he said has overstepped the limits of presidential power without facing any serious consequences from Congress.                      But Rep. Lou Barletta, Pennsylvania Republican, said he would give Mr. Boehner a chance — now that he has a GOP-led Senate to work with — to see what progress he can make.                      “I believe he deserves the chance to negotiate with a Senate which, for once, is not an automatic adversary,” Mr. Barletta said in a statement.                      The speaker of the House does not have to be elected to Congress, which produced some curious picks on Tuesday.                      One Republican voted for Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, while another voted for Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican.                      One Democrat voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
