WASHINGTON—President      Donald Trump’s        communications director resigned from his post after three months on the job, the White House said, a move that comes as the president seeks to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates’ ties to Russia.         Mike Dubke,    the president’s communications director, hasn’t been involved in the Russia probe, and unlike many top officials in the White House, wasn’t part of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. He joined the administration about a month after the president’s inauguration and has struggled to jell with Mr. Trump, White House officials have said.

Axios reported Tuesday that Mr. Dubke’s resignation was accepted.          Mr. Trump has been considering changes to his communications team for weeks. Mr. Dubke has been shouted at by Mr. Trump, and he was blamed internally when the White House initially had no people on cable television to defend the president’s May 9 firing of         James Comey    as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials said.     But some advisers believe that the communications and press-shop operations—the latter including press secretary         Sean Spicer    —have been a scapegoat for broader failings.     “Not every problem in the West Wing is a communications problem,” one White House official said. “There’s a leadership problem and a decision-making problem.”     Amid the Russia probe, top advisers to Mr. Trump have been considering requiring the president’s tweets to undergo legal vetting before being posted, as part of an overhaul of how White House communications work. Mr. Trump posted two tweets on Tuesday related to the probe of his associates’ ties to Russia, with one of the tweets related to his son-in-law and adviser         Jared Kushner.         “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News,” Mr. Trump, a Republican, wrote.          In the other, he retweeted a “Fox & Friends” tweet that said, “Jared Kushner didn’t suggest Russian communications channel in meeting, source says.” The tweet links to a Fox News article that cites a source saying the Russians broached the idea at Mr. Kushner’s December meeting with Russian Ambassador         Sergei Kislyak,    not Mr. Kushner.          During the transition, Mr. Kushner considered setting up a secret communications line with Russia to discuss the country’s military operations, a person familiar with the matter previously told the Journal.      The idea was discussed in the December meeting with Mr. Kislyak, this person said. As part of its larger probe, the FBI is scrutinizing Mr. Kushner’s contacts with Russians.     Asked in Tuesday’s daily press briefing whether the president knew of Mr. Kushner’s effort to establish a back channel to the Russians, Mr. Spicer referred to a statement from Mr. Kushner’s lawyer saying Mr. Kushner has volunteered to share with Congress or other investigators what he knows about the meetings.     Mr. Spicer declined to address whether the back-channel effort occurred, saying the question “presupposes facts that have not been confirmed.”     He also declined to say whether the president knew of the back-channel effort at the time, or whether he approved of it.      On whether the action was appropriate, Mr. Spicer cited comments from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and national-security adviser H.R. McMaster who said that, in general, back channels were an appropriate part of diplomacy.     Earlier this month, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as a special counsel charged with investigating Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether associates of Mr. Trump colluded with Moscow.                                         White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered questions Tuesday about President Donald Trump's response to reports that Jared Kushner was seeking to establish back-channel communications with the Russian government.

Also on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump criticized Germany over military spending and trade.     “We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Very bad for U.S. This will change.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      On Sunday, Chancellor         Angela Merkel    of Germany, who spent two days negotiating with Mr. Trump on trade and climate policy during Mr. Trump’s recent trip overseas, urged Europeans to unify in response to uncertainty from the U.S. on key issues.      “The times in which we could rely on others completely—they are partly past…we Europeans must truly take our destiny in our own hands,” she said.      Ms. Merkel said Tuesday that Europe needed to play a more assertive international role—including on foreign policy, trade, and migration.     “I consider this tremendously important,” Ms. Merkel said.      —Peter Nicholas, Anton Troianovski and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.
