Rising interest rates will put increasing pressure on government finances and push interest payments to record levels in coming decades, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday.In its annual long-term budget report, CBO said higher borrowing costs and rising levels of federal debt would push debt payments from 1.6% of the gross domestic product in 2018 to 3.1% in 2028 and 6.3% in 2048, which would be the highest level ever. At that point, interest payments would equal spending on Social Security.          Those payments would help push overall federal spending to 29% of GDP for the first time since World War II.     Rising levels of debt have long been a concern to policy makers. But low interest rates in the years after the recession made those costs cheaper for the government to bear.               Now, the strong economy is causing rates to rise once more, making debt more expensive to service.     CBO projects that yields on the 10-year Treasury note would rise from under 3% today to 3.7% in 2028 and 4.8% in 2048. While that is still relatively low by historical standards, continued federal deficits during that time would push up overall interest payments owed by the government.     As a result, Congress and future administrations responding to economic emergencies could find themselves strapped.     “When outstanding debt is large, the government has less flexibility to address financial and economic crises,” the report said.     CBO anticipates the Federal Reserve would continue raising its benchmark interest rate to 4% by 2021. Fed policy makers, by contrast, only project raising rates to 3.4% by 2020.     Rising government-debt levels and rising interest rates would reinforce each other. High debt levels would push interest rates up further, and higher debt payments would boost debt.     At the same time, CBO said the effect of the recent tax cut would result in slower growth in government revenues than previously anticipated through 2026. The report also noted that the aging population would raise the cost of Social Security and Medicare.     The report anticipates that overall federal debt would match the overall economy by the end of the next decade. In the early 2030s, debt as a share of GDP would match its previous record of 106%, reached in 1946. By 2048, debt to GDP would reach 152%.     “The prospect of large and growing debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policy makers with significant challenges,” said CBO Director Keith Hall in a statement.     The report takes into account last year’s tax overall and government spending plans. But it also assumes many of the individual tax cuts enacted last year expire after 2025, as stated in the law. If Congress decides to extend them, that likely would exacerbate the government’s debt.     Democrats on Capitol Hill pointed to the report to criticize the tax cuts, saying they worsened the country’s fiscal outlook. The cuts were pushed through by Republicans and signed into law by President      Donald Trump.             Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) called Tuesday’s report “another reminder about the true costs of handing out massive tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.”              Rep. Kevin Brady    (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the report pointed to the need to reduce spending, including on large programs such as Social Security and Medicare.     “To fix our national debt problem, Republicans and Democrats need to come together to address both mandatory and discretionary federal spending,” he said.     Corrections & Amplifications    The Congressional Budget Office report said an improving economy and rising levels of federal debt would push federal debt payments from 1.6% of GDP in 2018 to 3.1% in 2028 and 6.3% in 2048. An earlier version of this article incorrectly set the 2018 percentage at 1.8%. The report also said the 2048 percentage would equal Social Security spending. An earlier version also erroneously said the 2048 percentage would exceed Social Security spending.
