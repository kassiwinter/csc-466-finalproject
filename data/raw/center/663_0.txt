It's gotta be a positive campaign."Per the Post, Twitter applied its "manipulated media" tag to the tweet at around 5 p.m. on Sunday, roughly 18 hours after Scavino first posted it.Twitter announced its new manipulated media policy last month, designed to combat deceptively edited content. The tag doesn't seem entirely effective however, as a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider a glitch meant people who searched for the tweet weren't being shown the tag. The spokesperson said it was showing up in people's timelines, and that the company was working to fix the bug. When Business Insider searched for the tweet, the tag did not appear.Here's what the tweet looks like with the badge applied:TwitterThis is far from the first time Donald Trump has shared a doctored video on social media. In February the President shared an edited video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tearing up his Union address. Last year he shared another video of Pelosi edited to make it look like she was slurring her words.
