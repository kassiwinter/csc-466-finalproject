         WASHINGTON—Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) on Monday introduced the legislative text needed to establish a select committee with subpoena power to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, in advance of an expected vote in the House on Wednesday.     The resolution, which mirrors the language used to create the GOP-led select committee on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, gives Mrs. Pelosi the ability to appoint the chair and 13 members—five of them “after consultation with the minority leader,” a reference to         Rep. Kevin McCarthy    (R., Calif.).      Mrs. Pelosi is considering including a Republican lawmaker among Democrats’ eight appointments, according to a Pelosi aide.     The speaker had said last week that she would establish a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked an earlier effort to establish a bipartisan independent commission. The bipartisan legislation to establish one passed the House with the support of 35 Republicans, but in the Senate, only six Republicans supported it, leaving the bill short of the 60 votes needed to advance.          Former President      Donald Trump,        along with Mr. McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.), had urged Republicans to oppose the commission. The House impeached Mr. Trump in January for inciting insurrection against the U.S. government on Jan. 6, when his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the ratification of President Biden’s Electoral College win. Mr. Trump was acquitted by the Senate.     Newsletter Sign-up Politics Alert Major political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.      The legislation introduced by Mrs. Pelosi on Monday states that the committee’s purpose is to investigate and report on “the facts, circumstances, and causes relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack” against the Capitol, including the preparedness and response of security services and federal agencies.     The chair of the select committee would be empowered to issue subpoenas. The chair also could order the taking of depositions, including by subpoena, in consultation with the ranking Republican member, according to the resolution.     The structure gives Democrats wide latitude and more control over proceedings than they would have had if the independent commission had passed the Senate. The select committee will be a congressional panel, whereas current members of Congress would have been barred from serving on the commission, which would have had five members appointed by Democratic leaders and five by Republican leaders. Both sides would have shared responsibility for issuing subpoenas.     “Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. It is imperative that we establish the truth of that day and ensure such an attack cannot again happen,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement. “The Select Committee will investigate and report upon the facts and causes of the attack and report recommendations for preventing any future assault.”     Mr. McCarthy’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.         Politics News                         Rep. John Katko    of New York criticized the select committee as “literally the exact opposite” of the independent bipartisan commission he had proposed with Democrat         Bennie Thompson    of Mississippi, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. Katko, one of 10 House GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach Mr. Trump in January, is the panel’s top Republican.      “It would be a turbo-charged partisan exercise, not an honest fact-finding body that the American people and Capitol Police deserve,” he said in a statement. “For those reasons, I will not support its creation when voted upon.”     Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
