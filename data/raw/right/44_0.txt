 A new poll of citizens in Mexico says that a majority are against the entrance of migrants from Central America to their country on their way to seek asylum in the United States. The poll from the Washington Post and Reforma, a leading Mexican newspaper, found that nearly two thirds of Mexicans polled, 64 percent, said that migrants were a "burden" that took jobs and benefits away from their citizens. The issue has become more contentious for Mexican nationals after President Donald Trump began a new policy of metering asylum seekers at the border, and making many wait in Mexico for the results of their request. A video from Newsy featured a female Mexican citizen who angrily chanted, "you are not welcome here!" in a protest against migrants.
The poll also said that a majority, 55 percent, of Mexican citizens polled wanted the migrants to be deported back to their home countries. Only a third polled, 33 percent, said that Mexico should give migrants temporary asylum or residency. A very small percentage, 7 percent, said they wanted the country to give them permanent residency. The Mexican government has responded to pressure from Trump by offering more migrants benefits if they agree to stay in Mexico and abandon their attempt to seek asylum from the United States.  However, the Mexican to the United States, Martha Bárcena, said there's a limit to how long the country can host those seeking asylum. "So we're working with our Central American neighbors to see what we can do so that people do not come to the border," Bárcena said. "We maybe hold people for half a year," she added, "one year, but not two years if the asylum process just goes on and on."Here's a video about the poll from Newsy:     	Poll: Mexicans oppose migrants in country  www.youtube.com
