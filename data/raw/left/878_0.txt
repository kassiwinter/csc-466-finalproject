 Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Mourning the victims of the deadly shooting rampage at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school, President Obama says it's time to "take meaningful action" to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring.
"Most of those who died were just young children with their whole lives ahead of them. And every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt," the President says in his weekly address. "Among the fallen were also teachers - men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams."
Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman opened fire Friday morning in Sandy Hook Elementary School.
"Our hearts are broken today. We grieve for the families of those we lost. And we keep in our prayers the parents of those who survived. Because as blessed as they are to have their children home, they know that their child's innocence has been torn away far too early," Obama says.
The president, who delivered similar, emotional remarks Friday afternoon, says that this weekend, "Michelle and I are doing what I know every parent is doing - holding our children as close as we can and reminding them how much we love them."
While the President has remained relatively quiet on the issue of gun control during his first term, he said it is time "to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics."
House Speaker John Boehner canceled the weekly GOP address "so President Obama can speak for the entire nation at this time of mourning."
