WASHINGTON—Attorney-general nominee         William Barr    promised on Tuesday never to cave to political pressure from President Trump or elsewhere, saying his age and experience free him to act independently from a president who has frequently attacked the Justice Department.Mr. Barr, in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, repeatedly promised to allow special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to proceed to its conclusion. He said he would refuse a hypothetical order by Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Mueller without cause. “I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong—by anybody, whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president,” said Mr. Barr, 68 years old, who served as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.     Senators in both parties sought assurances that Mr. Barr could bring stability to a Justice Department rocked by political turbulence and deal with a president who publicly insulted his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over his recusal from oversight of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. The probe, which is also looking at claims of possible obstruction of justice and collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Moscow, has led to guilty pleas and the conviction of several of Mr. Trump’s former aides. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.               Some lawmakers, especially Republicans, suggested they had received that assurance. “I want to thank you for being willing to take this task on,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), making his debut as chairman of the Judiciary panel. “We’ve got a lot of problems at the Department of Justice. I think morale is low, and we need to change that.”     Despite impassioned speeches from senators on both sides, there were few fireworks and Mr. Barr didn’t appear to make any serious flubs. With Republicans holding a 53-47 advantage in the Senate and with possible support from some Democrats, Mr. Barr is expected to be confirmed relatively smoothly.     Mr. Barr was known as a reliable hand during his first stint as attorney general and a steady force over nearly three decades as a lawyer in the corporate world. Still, he would be returning to a different Justice Department, and a far more turbulent political environment, than when he left in 1993.     “I feel I’m in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences,” he said. “I can truly be independent.”     Sen.         Dianne Feinstein    of California, the committee’s top Democrat, stressed the importance of that quality during an unpredictable presidency.     “It’s important that the next attorney general be able to strongly resist pressure, whether from the administration or Congress, to conduct investigations for political purposes,” Ms. Feinstein said. “You must have the integrity, the strength and the fortitude to tell the president no, regardless of the consequences.”     At the heart of many lawmakers’ concerns was the future of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, following Mr. Trump’s decision to oust Mr. Sessions in November and give oversight of the probe to acting Attorney General         Matthew Whitaker,    who had been openly critical of the inquiry. Mr. Whitaker is scheduled to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Feb. 8, the panel announced Tuesday.     Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein,    who had been supervising Mr. Mueller under Mr. Sessions, is expected to leave the Justice Department after Mr. Barr’s confirmation. Mr. Barr said he had spoken with Mr. Rosenstein about his planned departure and that the aide wasn’t forced out and would help with the transition.     Mr. Barr said he viewed Mr. Mueller, with whom he worked in the Justice Department in the 1990s and with whom he has remained friends, as a fair-minded investigator. “I don’t believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt,” Mr. Barr said, contradicting Mr. Trump’s frequent characterization of the inquiry.     Many senators asked about a June 2018 memo Mr. Barr wrote that was strongly critical of aspects of the Mueller inquiry. The nominee said he had raised his concerns about the Mueller probe—primarily Mr. Mueller’s exploration of whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey—at a lunch with Mr. Rosenstein.     Mr. Rosenstein didn’t respond and was “sphinx-like,” Mr. Barr said, prompting him to put his thoughts in writing. The resulting memo argued that investigators shouldn’t be able to press Mr. Trump on the firing, which Mr. Barr saw as within the president’s lawful authority. A Justice Department spokeswoman didn’t dispute Mr. Barr’s account.                                         Attorney General nominee William Barr said in the opening statement of his confirmation hearing that he has confidence in special counsel Robert Mueller and "on my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish his work."

The memo “raises questions” about Mr. Barr’s willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts,” Ms. Feinstein said, adding that the attorney general’s job “is to serve as the people’s lawyer, not the president’s lawyer.”     Mr. Barr said he accepted Mr. Trump’s nomination reluctantly, as it meant emerging from partial retirement and a comfortable home life. He disclosed that he was asked in 2017 to represent Mr. Trump and declined. “My wife and I were looking forward to a bit of respite, and I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder,” he said.                  ““I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong, by anybody, whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president. I am going to do what I think is right.””                — William Barr, at his confirmation hearing Jan. 15             Mr. Barr said he nonetheless met with Mr. Trump at the time, and the president asked him about Mr. Mueller. “I said Bob is a straight-shooter and should be dealt with as such,” Mr. Barr said. He added that the president “asked for my phone number, I gave it to him, and I never heard from him again”—until Mr. Trump called to ask about the attorney general post.     Mr. Barr entered the hearing room surrounded by supporters and family members, including his wife, Christine, three daughters and a grandson, Liam. Mr. Barr joked that his grandson would someday work in the Justice Department, where both of his parents now work.     Also in the room were George Terwilliger, who was Mr. Barr’s deputy during his previous stint as attorney general, and Ira Raphaelson, who was his counsel at that time. A handful of civil rights leaders also attended, including Vanita Gupta, a former head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division who has been critical of Mr. Barr’s record in that area.     This was the Judiciary Committee’s first high-profile session since last year’s divisive confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Mr. Graham referred to his reputation as a figure who is often collegial—as on the immigration issue—and other times partisan. “I want us to do better, and I’ll be as measured as possible,” Mr. Graham said. “The immigration Lindsey will show up. But the other guy is there, too, and I don’t like him any more than you do.”                                                 William Barr on Capitol Hill on Tuesday                  Photo:            saul loeb/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                                 Related Coverage        If Mr. Barr is confirmed, it would bring together a forceful advocate of executive power with a president who has shown a willingness to wield that power in unorthodox ways. Mr. Barr’s nomination was applauded by officials in both parties, and many at the Justice Department, as a more traditional pick than some of the others Mr. Trump was considering.     As a high-ranking Justice Department official in the late 1980s, Mr. Barr argued for an expansive view of presidential power. Serving as attorney general from 1991 to 1993, he pushed tough-on-crime policies and took a hard-line approach to immigration—positions that could fit well with Mr. Trump’s agenda, though Mr. Barr suggested at the hearing he was open to reviewing tough sentencing policies.                                         Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation could soon be overseen by William Barr, President Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Justice. Here’s where the Russia probe stands.
