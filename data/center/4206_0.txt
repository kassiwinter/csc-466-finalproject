WASHINGTON—The U.S. labor market showed historic strength in April, with employers hiring at a faster pace and the unemployment rate falling to a half-century low.The latest numbers, however, also raise the question of whether enough workers can be drawn into the labor market to sustain the momentum of a nearly decadelong expansion. The economy added a seasonally adjusted 263,000 jobs in April—the 103rd straight month of gains—and joblessness fell to 3.6%, the lowest level since December 1969, the Labor Department said Friday. The better hiring coincided with solid wage growth.     “The labor market is as strong as it’s been in a half-century,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. “We’re in a spot to see the expansion continue.”        
Analysis        Markets reacted positively, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 197.16 points, or 0.7%, to the latest report showing strength for the U.S. economy after a rocky start to the year. The data also are unlikely to move Federal Reserve policy makers from their wait-and-see stance that the economy isn’t cooling but is still far from overheating.               The jobs report was largely better than expected. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had projected a slower pace of hiring and for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.8%. Job growth in the prior two months also was better than previously reported.     The long jobs expansion is increasingly reaching Americans at the margins. Wage gains have strengthened in recent years, especially for workers earning the smallest paychecks, and unemployment has fallen for those who have historically struggled, including people with lower levels of education.     Private-sector workers saw solid wage improvements in April, with average hourly earnings up 3.2% from a year earlier. The annual gain in wages was stronger than the 2.8% increase in April 2018 from a year earlier. Pay gains haven’t accelerated much further since year-over-year wage growth broke above 3% last year for the first time in nearly a decade. Still, workers have been enjoying better pay in real terms, as average raises exceed price increases. The consumer-price index rose 1.9% from a year earlier in March.                                         Economists say the U.S. would be better off if the country's GDP rose at a 3% rate or more each year, rather than the 2% rate it has been growing at for a while. WSJ explains what GDP is, and why economists are so fixated on its growth. Illustration: Stephanie Swart/The Wall Street Journal                                                                                                     But a vexing challenge remains: Employers still struggle to pull workers off the sidelines to power a growing economy at a time when more baby boomers are poised to retire. An economy’s potential growth relies on the size of a nation’s workforce and how much those workers are able to produce. There were signs that workers got more productive in the first quarter.     At the same time, economists expected strong hiring and continued wage growth to encourage Americans who hadn’t been seeking work to join the labor force. Instead, such participation was flat from a year ago, and the U.S. workforce shrank in April. The share of people in their prime working years who had a job or were looking for one, while higher than a year ago, pulled back for the second month, cutting into recent gains.     That apparent pullback could be a measurement issue that resolves itself. The jobs report is derived from two separate surveys, one of employers and one of families, and those surveys were at odds in the latest month.          The survey of 142,000 employers, which economists find more reliable month to month, showed strong hiring. That is consistent with the idea that Americans are getting back to work in greater numbers. The survey of 60,000 households, however, reported fewer Americans were working or even looking for work. In the longer run, the data from both surveys tend to move together.     More broadly, surveys this past week from the Institute for Supply Management pointed to slower job growth for both manufacturers and service-sector companies. Those surveys also suggested growth in wider economic output is poised to cool, consistent with the view of many economists for gross-domestic-product gains to slow after increasing at a 3.2% rate during the first three months of the year.     Consumer confidence, however, improved in April, according to the Conference Board. When combined with solid wage growth, that could point to better consumer spending, the primary driver of the U.S. economy.          So chief executives like Barbara Moran-Goodrich of Moran Family of Brands face good news—a strong job market is putting more people on the road and creating demand for her company’s auto-repair franchises. But she is also challenged to find the workers to meet that demand. Moran’s auto facilities across the nation are seeking to fill about 50 to 75 open positions. It has been particularly difficult for them to find auto-repair technicians.     Franchisees are focusing their efforts on internship and apprenticeship programs launched in recent years. So far, those haven’t produced nearly as many skilled workers as the company needs, Ms. Moran-Goodrich said.     Employment at         Rockwell Automation Corp.    , the Milwaukee maker of industrial equipment and technology, has increased by about 5% in the past three years. The company projects it will need more workers soon, as will customers who wanted to buy its products but were concerned about finding workers to operate the high-tech equipment, Chief Executive         Blake Moret    said.         More on the Economy                Rockwell is stepping up training, Mr. Moret said.     Last year, Rockwell trained 100 military veterans in a 12-week, intensive residential program and then placed those workers at its own firm and with its customers. The company aims to expand the program to get more workers to its customers.     “We’re helping them meet their labor demands because when they’re successful, then we’re going to be successful,” he said.          There is still capacity to draw additional workers into the labor market, said University of Chicago economist Erik Hurst. Prime-age labor-force participation remains well below its 2000 peak, and a broader measure of unemployment and underemployment remains somewhat elevated compared with 2000.     “I think the labor force will grow,” Mr. Hurst said, adding the unemployment rate could even tick up as workers are drawn in. “Especially since there’s been some response in wages, workers are on the margin of working or not might consider taking a job.”     Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
