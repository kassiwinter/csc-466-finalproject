           Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit on Tuesday against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, claiming the four states exploited the pandemic to justify ignoring election laws.
In papers filed with the U.S. Supreme Court, Paxton claimed the states unlawfully enacted last-minute changes, which skewed the results of the general election.
The papers also allege that the majority of the rushed decisions, made by local officials, were not approved by the state legislatures, thereby circumventing the Constitution.
“The battleground states flooded their people with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while ignoring statutory requirements as to how they were received, evaluated and counted,” according to a statement posted on the Texas attorney general’s website.
“Trust in the integrity of our election processes is sacrosanct and binds our citizenry and the States in this union together. Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin destroyed that trust and compromised the security and integrity of the 2020 election.
“The states violated statutes enacted by their duly elected legislatures, thereby violating the Constitution. By ignoring both state and federal law, these states have not only tainted the integrity of their own citizens’ vote, but of Texas and every other state that held lawful elections,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their failure to abide by the rule of law casts a dark shadow of doubt over the outcome of the entire election. We now ask that the Supreme Court step in to correct this egregious error.”
In court papers, Paxton claimed ”unconstitutional changes opened the door to election irregularities in various forms" and that each of the four states “flagrantly violated constitutional rules governing the appointment of presidential electors.”
He asked the court to restrain the states from voting in the electoral college until it hears arguments in the case.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
