LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister         Theresa May    was fighting to save her Brexit deal on Thursday after several ministers resigned, deepening the political turmoil over the terms of her plan to exit from the European Union.Six members of the government, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, one of the architects of the deal, quit Thursday as the prime minister faced a barrage of criticism over the plan in Parliament, raising the possibility that she could face a challenge to her leadership. In a news conference late Thursday, Mrs. May stood by her deal and suggested she would fight any leadership challenge. “This is a Brexit that delivers on the priorities of the British people,” she said, adding that not moving forward with it “would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.”      “Am I going to see this through? Yes,” she said.                The British pound fell sharply after the resignations were announced, closing down 1.67% against the dollar on the day, its biggest daily decline against the U.S. currency since October 2016.     The coming days will be critical for both Mrs. May’s Brexit deal and her premiership as she seeks to quell a rebellion that has been brewing for months within her own party over the U.K.’s future ties to the EU. Members of her Conservative Party were openly plotting Thursday to try to trigger a no-confidence vote in an effort to force Mrs. May to negotiate a different deal with Brussels.      On Wednesday, Mrs. May secured approval from her cabinet for a Brexit pact that would see the U.K. bound to the EU for years after it formally quits the bloc in March, hampering the country’s hopes of negotiating trade deals with other countries and giving Brussels final say in arrangements to prevent a hard border in Ireland.                                                                                                                                                           The pact has drawn fierce disapproval not only from the opposition Labour Party, but also from key Conservative Party figures who said Mrs. May has conceded too much.      In addition to Mr. Raab,         Esther McVey,    the pensions secretary, and two other ministers also resigned, along with two more junior ministerial aides.              Michael Gove,    the most prominent Brexit hard-liner left in the government, didn’t publicly express his support for or opposition to the deal on Thursday.      In an address to a rowdy Parliament on Thursday, Mrs. May appealed to lawmakers of all parties to vote for it when it goes to the House of Commons for approval.     “The choice is clear: We can choose to leave with no deal. We can risk no Brexit at all. Or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated,” Mrs. May said. “Voting against a deal will take us all back to square one.”     But the raucous debate underscored the challenges she faces.      “It is mathematically impossible to get this deal through,” said Mark Francois, a euroskeptic Conservative. Mr. Francois said he estimates that more than 80 Tory lawmakers are prepared to vote against the deal, as are Mrs. May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist Party and opposition parties. “The stark reality, prime minister, is that it was dead on arrival.”      Mrs. May relies on Northern Ireland’s DUP for a majority in the U.K.’s 650-seat Parliament. That alliance looked increasingly shaky on Thursday, as members of the party criticized the deal.        
Related        Mrs. May, who was in favor of remaining in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum, has struggled to unite her Conservative Party. Some of its lawmakers want the U.K. to retain close ties to its biggest trading partner after it exits the bloc, while others want the country to break free so it can strike free-trade agreements with other countries. Mrs. May has spent her premiership jousting with a core of heavily euroskeptic Conservative lawmakers who have repeatedly threatened to oust her from office if she didn’t deliver a Brexit deal they deem acceptable.     A Conservative Party leadership challenge can be triggered if 48 Tory lawmakers submit letters of no confidence to a special committee. Even if such a challenge emerges, it is unlikely that a majority of Tories would then vote in favor of ousting her from office. However, a rebellion of 48 lawmakers would mean Mrs. May wouldn’t have the support within her own ranks to get a Brexit deal voted through Parliament.          That would be a clear signal that Mrs. May has to go back to the negotiating table.     Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of a group of Conservative euroskeptic lawmakers, submitted his letter of no confidence Thursday and called for Mrs. May to be replaced. “We didn’t ask for the right things” from the EU, he said.               Jeremy Corbyn,    the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said his party would vote against the proposed agreement. “The government must withdraw this half-baked deal,” he said in the House of Commons.     Mrs. May’s plan would leave the U.K. largely within the economic orbit of the EU, with Britain continuing to follow many of the bloc’s regulations and applying its tariffs. But in leaving the EU, London would lose the leverage to influence policies in the EU, which represents half of U.K. trade.     Some of Mrs. May’s critics have charged that her deal represents the worst of both worlds and betrays the 2016 vote by leaving the U.K. tethered to the EU—thus constraining its ability to strike free-trade deals with other nations—but without influence on the bloc’s decisions.      Under the terms negotiated, Northern Ireland could be left more closely tied than the rest of the U.K. to the EU if a broader Brexit deal on Britain’s long-term trading and economic relations can’t be reached.     Mr. Raab said in his resignation letter that “the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.”     Investors are concerned about the possibility that the U.K. could leave the EU without a deal in March.           Along with the pound’s decline, the U.K.’s FTSE 250 stock index ended the session 1.3% lower.     The EU has called a summit of leaders to discuss the withdrawal agreement on Nov. 25.     European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday the EU remained ready for all scenarios, including a possible reversal of Brexit.     “All I can say is that the EU is prepared for a final deal with the United Kingdom in November,” he said. “We are also prepared for a no-deal scenario.”     Other European leaders watched on with concern at the political meltdown in the U.K.     “We have a politics of Brexit in Westminster that is incredibly divisive and difficult,” said         Simon Coveney,    Ireland’s deputy prime minister. “Theresa May will now have to persuade people that the consequences of not voting for this, of pulling it down, are chaotic, provides uncertainty about the future, and we don’t know what the political consequences of that will be.”      —Paul Hannon contributed to this article.
