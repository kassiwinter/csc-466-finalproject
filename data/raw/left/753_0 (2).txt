Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a shootout with police, were motivated by religion, according to U.S. officials. Investigators have also been looking into Tamerlan Tsarnaev's time spent in Russia. The older brother was known to have traveled to two predominantly Muslim Russian provinces, Dagestan and Chechnya. Authorities were examining whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have been influenced by the region's militant population, who have railed against Russian security forces for years. Although it was first reported that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev would not receive Miranda warnings, he was reportedly read the Miranda rights after a delay, at his hospital bed Monday.GRAPHIC WARNING: Boston Marathon explosion
