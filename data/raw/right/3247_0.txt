8:47 AM ET  Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced his bid to become the next U.S. Senator from Utah in a Friday morning tweet.Romney appeared to take aim at President Donald Trump in his announcement saying, “Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world, Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion,” and adding that “people treat others with respect” at the Utah capitol building. Romney has lived in Utah for approximately five five years after losing his 2012 presidential bid to Barack Obama. The former Massachusetts governor has been accused of carpetbagging by Republican officials in the state. “I think he’s keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah because, let’s face it, Mitt Romney doesn’t live here, his kids weren’t born here, he doesn’t shop here,” Utah GOP chairman Rob Anderson told the Salt Lake City tribune.
