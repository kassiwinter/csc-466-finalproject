A personal scandal has reshaped the pivotal Senate contest in North Carolina, as Republicans ramp up their criticism of Democratic candidate         Cal Cunningham    and Democrats try to manage the fallout in a race that had been leaning his way.Mr. Cunningham, who is married, apologized for the flirtatious and sexually suggestive text messages he exchanged with a public-relations strategist soon after they emerged last week. The strategist,         Arlene Guzman Todd,    said this week in a statement to the Associated Press that her relationship with Mr. Cunningham “spanned several months and consisted primarily of a series of text exchanges and an in-person encounter.” Ms. Guzman Todd couldn’t be reached for comment.     The Army Reserve, in which Mr. Cunningham serves, said this week it had opened an investigation into the matter without providing more detail. In many circumstances, adultery violates military rules, and the Cunningham campaign has said it would cooperate with the investigation.               The developments have given Sen.         Thom Tillis    (R., N.C.) and his campaign fresh ammunition in the closing weeks of the race, which polls had shown Mr. Cunningham leading.     On track to be the most expensive Senate contest this year, with at least $100 million in television advertising spent or reserved to be spent, the race could determine which party controls the Senate, where Republicans currently have a 53-47 advantage. Along with Maine, Arizona and Colorado, North Carolina is seen as one of Democrats’ best chances to flip seats in November.     “That race has been a tossup for a while and manna from heaven fell into Tillis’s lap, Cunningham handed to Tillis a gift, and that gives Tillis an advantage,” said         Carter Wrenn,    a longtime Republican strategist in the state. “But we’re so polarized in North Carolina, the race is still up in the air. I don’t think you can say either candidate can put it away.”            Sources: aggregated race ratings from Cook Political Report, Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics      Mr. Cunningham, a 47-year-old former state senator and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has largely stayed out of the public eye this week. A town-hall event featuring him that had been scheduled for Monday was postponed. In remarks at a League of Conservation Voters event Wednesday, Mr. Cunningham again apologized for his behavior.     “I hope each of you watching at home accept this sincere apology and that we will continue to work together to change the direction of our country and strengthen our state,” he said, according to his prepared remarks.     While Mr. Cunningham has broadly apologized, neither he nor his campaign has publicly addressed the details of the relationship. Some political observers in North Carolina said they think Mr. Cunningham should more proactively address the situation.     “You can’t bunker this. He’s got to put his big boy pants on and face the state press corps and do his mea culpa and hope that will stop the thousand cuts he’s facing right now with all the media digging at him every day,” said         Brad Crone,    an independent North Carolina political strategist.     At a press event Friday, Mr. Cunningham was asked repeatedly about the affair and whether he had extramarital relationships with any other women, questions which he didn’t answer.     “I’ve taken responsibility for the hurt that I’ve caused in my personal life. I’ve apologized for it, I’ve said what I’m going to say about it,” he said.     Mr. Tillis’s campaign released a new advertisement Thursday calling Mr. Cunningham’s campaign “one big lie” and showing local news footage about the relationship. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader         Mitch McConnell     (R., Ky.), has also put out ads attacking Mr. Cunningham on the issue.     “I feel bad for his family for what they’re going through, but you can’t found a whole campaign on truth, duty and honor and then be guilty of what he’s apparently guilty of and now has apologized for. It’s a hypocrisy that I think the North Carolina voters will reject,” Mr. Tillis, 60, a former speaker of the North Carolina House, said Thursday on Fox News.     Democrats across the state are hopeful that the affair won’t overtake other issues in the race—including health care and the coronavirus crisis—in voters’ minds. They also are optimistic that voters who prefer Democratic presidential nominee      Joe Biden        over President         Trump    will still vote for the Democratic Senate candidate.     “People are not as concerned about the candidates’ personal choices as they are about the issues,” said         Aisha Dew,    a North Carolina Democratic strategist.     Mr. Trump, who faced allegations of extramarital affairs and sexual misconduct ahead of the 2016 election, which he denied, won North Carolina by 3.6 percentage points that year as he went on to take the presidency. Recent opinion polls show Mr. Trump narrowly trailing Mr. Biden in the state.              Patrick Keneipp,    a registered independent in Wake Forest, N.C., said he was initially hesitant to still vote for Mr. Cunningham after the reports of his text messages came out, but he said Thursday that he plans to vote for the Democratic candidate. If more revelations emerge about Mr. Cunningham, though, he said he might not vote in the Senate election or might cast his ballot for Mr. Tillis.     “If another shoe drops or another story comes out, I could still change my mind,” said Mr. Keneipp, 71.     In a campaign memo prepared for donors, a consultant to Mr. Tillis’s race wrote that Mr. Cunningham’s response to the scandal was more important than the behavior itself.     “It’s possible that some voters have become desensitized to sexual immorality from a politician, but what they undeniably still desire above all things is for their elected leaders to be genuine,” the memo read.     Mr. Tillis’s campaign was itself pitched into uncertainty last week when he tested positive for Covid-19, prompting the campaign to close its campaign headquarters and halt in-person political events. As of Monday, Mr. Tillis stopped experiencing symptoms, and members of his campaign staff that recently had been in close proximity to him tested negative, according to the campaign and his Senate office.     In a contest that is expected to be very tight, even small movements in voter sentiment could prove decisive.     “The race is close enough that a swing in 15,000 to 20,000 votes is going to be critical. It’s down to hand-to-hand combat at this point,” said Mr. Crone.     Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com      Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
