SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico—Puerto Rico Gov.         Ricardo Rosselló    said he would resign from office, bowing to public outcry over scandals that have convulsed the U.S. territory’s political system and further imperiled its economy.His decision Wednesday marked the first-ever resignation of a Puerto Rico governor and followed the release of nearly 900 pages of vulgar messages between him and his advisers, sparking protests that drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into the streets of San Juan. Mr. Rosselló said his resignation would be effective on Aug. 2 at 5:00 p.m. The governorship would typically be passed to the secretary of state, but he was among several officials who recently resigned. Secretary of Justice         Wanda Vázquez    is next in the line of succession and Mr. Rosselló said she would replace him. He said he would help facilitate an orderly transition.     “I gave the maximum, dedicating day and night, weekends and holidays to meet the needs of my people,” Mr. Rosselló said. “I feel that to continue in this position presents difficulty for the success that we have achieved to endure.”               His announcement came after 11:30 p.m., hours after it was expected—a delay that left many in Puerto Rico anxious and wondering whether it would come at all.     Mr. Rosselló—a member of Puerto Rico’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party and a Democrat—was elected in 2016, promising to dig Puerto Rico out of a mountain of bond debt and pension obligations and to reverse a decade of economic contraction. But his successor will assume office as many of those problems remain unsolved.                                                 Demonstrators in San Juan, Puerto Rico, chanted slogans in front of riot police and called for the resignation of Gov. Rosselló on Wednesday.

Recent public protests have demanded a harder line against the unpopular fiscal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances and steering its restructuring.     Ms. Vázquez said Mr. Rosselló made “the right decision, for the good of both his family and for Puerto Rico, as I let him know.” She said she would assume the governor’s office “if necessary,” leaving open the possibility that another politician from the New Progressive Party could be elevated to the role.      Ms. Vázquez is a former prosecutor and used to lead an office that addressed discrimination and violence against women.     In 2018, she faced allegations of potential ethics violations over alleged interference in a burglary case involving her daughter’s home, though it was later cleared by a judge. Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz called for her resignation as a result—which could be a source of tension while she is governor.      On Wednesday, Carlos “Johnny” Méndez, president of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives, called a special session for Thursday to begin impeachment proceedings against Mr. Rosselló. Mr. Méndez had said the only way to halt them would be if the governor resigned. Earlier in the day, Mr. Méndez said he received a report he commissioned from a panel of lawyers which concluded that Mr. Rosselló potentially committed crimes in connection with the leaked messages.

It’s become a national embarrassment, his decision to remain,” said         Melissa Mark-Viverito,    a former New York City Council speaker who was insulted in the text messages, while standing Wednesday outside La Fortaleza, the governor’s mansion, where crowds gathered throughout the day.     A roar erupted in Old San Juan Wednesday night when thousands of demonstrators who packed the streets near La Fortaleza heard news of Mr. Rosselló’s resignation.                                                 People celebrate next to La Fortaleza after the resignation announcement of the Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello, in San Juan on Wednesday.

This chat confirmed what people already knew.”     Mr. Rosselló was plunged into political crisis after federal authorities unveiled a corruption probe that reached deep into the government and indicted two former high-ranking officials. Then, text messages between the governor and top aides were leaked online, containing sexist and antigay comments and remarks dismissive of the public and of deaths tied to the hurricane.     Onetime political allies, business leaders and angry residents coalesced in recent days to demand his ouster.     As recently as Sunday, Mr. Rosselló had vowed to serve out his term, though he said he wouldn’t run for re-election in 2020.      Mr. Rosselló’s successor will have to restore credibility with the federal government in Washington, which controls tens of billions of dollars of funding aimed at helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria. The storm destroyed an electrical system that was vulnerable due to years of underinvestment, plunging Puerto Rico into the longest blackout in U.S. history. For some, the lights didn’t come back on for 11 months.

On Wednesday, Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress and Mr. Rosselló’s former running mate, urged President Trump in a letter to install a federal coordinator to oversee the spending of reconstruction funds in light of the recent scandals.     “Greater efficiency and transparency in disbursement of funds is needed so that the people of Puerto Rico, U.S. taxpayers and the federal government can be confident in the results,” she wrote.     The island’s government is also under pressure from creditors to resume debt payments on tens of billions of dollars in defaulted bonds and the economy remains fragile. Data on electricity use, payrolls and cement sales suggest federal spending provided an economic stimulus after Hurricane Maria, but that has dissipated, said         Brad Setser,    an economics fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.     “Federal aid helped Puerto Rico get back on its feet, but over the past 12 months there hasn’t been any continued momentum,” Mr. Setser said. “It looks like Puerto Rico’s economy is, at the margin, likely contracting again which is disappointing.”     Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
