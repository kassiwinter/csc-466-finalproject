        There’s only one thing not open on the southern border: media access to the operations of Customs and Border Protection. In a totalitarian effort at hiding the truth, the Biden administration has blocked the press. Veteran photojournalist John Moore raised the alarm on Twitter over the weekend: “I respectfully ask US Customs and Border Protection to stop blocking media access to their border operations,” he wrote. “I have photographed CBP under Bush, Obama and Trump but now — zero access is granted to media. These long-lens images taken from the Mexican side.” That’s right: He had to cross the border himself to shoot unrestricted. There’s more press freedom in Mexico than in the United States. Because most migrants are crossing on federal land, the feds have the power to keep the press away, but Moore says there’s “no precedent” for them doing so on this scale. It can only be because Biden wants to hide the extent of his complete failure at the border — and just how many people are being waved in. Moore is surely right that “showing the US response to the current immigrant surge is exactly the media’s role.” And Team Biden’s unpredecented effort to avoid that scrutiny is truly disgraceful.
