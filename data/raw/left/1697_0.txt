Sources close to Mrs. Clinton say she is preparing to address the controversy in the coming days, and one option is a news conference. Politico                        and CNN reported on the plans earlier.                       Mrs. Clinton has spoken at numerous events since The New York Times reported that she exclusively used a private email account while at the State Department, but she has not spoken about the report in public                         beyond one Twitter post late Wednesday night that said she wanted the public to see her emails.                       A news conference would be a large step for Mrs. Clinton’s fledgling presidential campaign, offering the first time she would face reporters as the presumptive Democratic nominee in 2016. She has not                         held a news conference in over two years, and hasn’t held a purely political news conference in more than five years.                       A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton did not immediately respond to requests to comment.
