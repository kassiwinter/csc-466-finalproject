  	On Monday evening, protesters in St. Louis who chaotically clashed with police over the shooting of an unarmed black resident jumped on a reporter’s car and threw a “blood-like substance” on the hood.
New York Times reporter Julie Bosman, who covers the region, said they apologized after realizing she “wasn’t police.” Confrontations between police and residents have intensified after Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot to death by a cop over the weekend. The FBI is now investigating the shooting. Bosman said the Ferguson, Missouri, area resembled a “war zone” a night after locals rioted and looted, presumably to protest Brown’s death. Bosman reported that protesters “threw rocks at police in riot gear” and shouted, “Don’t shoot!” She also tweeted that there were “at least 100 police on the scene,” and they were “shooting rubber bullets at crowd, including reporters and photographers.” Many residents were trapped after police reportedly blocked the exits of various neighborhoods in the area as the clashes intensified.

A small number of people jumped on my car and threw a blood-like substance on the hood; then realized I wasn’t police and apologized.
