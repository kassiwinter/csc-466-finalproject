WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump expressed strong support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said he’s “not an isolationist” after meeting Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time since taking office.Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference with Ms. Merkel, defended his approach to the issue and said the two leaders would later discuss trade issues. “I’m not an isolationist. I’m a free trader, but I’m also a fair trader,” he said.     His comments on NATO were aimed at easing concerns that European leaders, such as Ms. Merkel, have had about his support for the alliance.               “I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO,” Mr. Trump said, adding that member nations must pay their share to the alliance, a long held view. He praised Germany for Ms. Merkel’s commitment to eventually increasing military spending.     Ms. Merkel voiced support for the European Union, an alliance Mr. Trump has criticized. She also sought to stress the close relations between the U.S. and Germany.     “There are a number of issues where we will continue to cooperate very closely,” Ms. Merkel said.                                         President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to have a tense first meeting, based on their interaction at a photo-op after their Oval Office meeting.

She said she would be happy if negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and the EU were resumed.     “It is, of course, more than fair that both sides that make agreements want to benefit from them,” Ms. Merkel said at the news conference. “In this spirit, I would be happy if we resumed the negotiations between the European Union and the United States of America.”     She noted, however, that only the EU—rather than individual member states such as Germany—was able to negotiate trade agreements.      The proposed EU-U.S. trade deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, has long been supported by Ms. Merkel. The talks weren’t finished when former President         Barack Obama    left office.      Mr. Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of Mr. Obama’s 12-nation Pacific trade agreement, has attacked past U.S. trade policy, and he hasn’t resumed talks with the EU on the TTIP.        
Related        TTIP talks stalled last year on political concerns on both sides of the Atlantic, and the Trump administration is currently considering possible bilateral agreements with the U.K., which is seeking to exit the EU, and Japan. But first his trade officials hope to complete talks on overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement.     Earlier, in a photo op after their Oval Office meeting, there appeared to be tension between the two leaders. They sat next to each other in separate chairs. Ms. Merkel was leaning toward Mr. Trump. But he didn’t look at her and sat with his hands between his knees.     At one point, Ms. Merkel asked the president if he wanted to shake hands, as is customary in these instances. Mr. Trump didn’t respond.     Following the news conference, the two did shake hands.     Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel differ on a host of issues. Mr. Trump has been critical of the EU, as well as NATO. German officials also have been concerned about Mr. Trump’s approach to trade, which favors unilateral agreements rather than those with multiple nations.     Mr. Trump struck a milder tone with Ms. Merkel than the one he had taken during his presidential campaign, when he often criticized the German leader and called her refugee policy “insane.”     Ms. Merkel, whose government has allowed hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants to enter Germany, also drew contrasts to the president’s policy on immigration and foreign aid.     Ms. Merkel said national borders should be protected by cooperation among neighboring countries. She also spoke in favor of development aid—which Mr. Trump in his 2018 budget proposal wants to cut—referring to such aid as a component of fostering national security and of managing migration.     “Migration, illegal migration, must of course be managed and controlled,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I am convinced that we must do this with an eye on the refugees, that we must do this by giving opportunities to refugees on the ground.”     —Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.
