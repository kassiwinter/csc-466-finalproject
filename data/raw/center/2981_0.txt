WASHINGTON—The House on Friday approved legislation providing $15.25 billion for victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and pushing two fiscal deadlines into December, capping a dizzying week of deal-cutting and rapid-fire voting on Capitol Hill.The bill, which will extend the government’s funding and suspend its debt limit until Dec. 8, passed the House in a 316-90 vote with scant debate. It passed the Senate on Thursday. President      Donald Trump        signed the measure into law on Friday.                                          President Trump defied the Republican Party by striking a deal with Democrats in Congress on raising the debt ceiling, keeping the government running and funding hurricane relief. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains whether this signals Trump will be more independent in the coming weeks.

But the speed with which it traveled through both chambers belied the angst it generated among Republicans this week when Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democratic leaders.      “This Administration will always put the needs of the American people above partisan politics as usual,” the White House said in a statement, accompanied by a photograph of Mr. Trump signing the bill at Camp David.               House Republicans were unhappy about raising the debt ceiling without reining in federal spending, a longstanding GOP goal, and they tangled with top administration officials Friday morning shortly before the bill cleared their chamber.     After years of blaming former President         Barack Obama    for the growing national debt, some Republicans said they were responsible for any abdication of fiscal discipline now that the GOP controls the White House and both chambers of Congress.     “We Republicans said ‘When we’re in charge we’re going to find a way to help the American people, but also be fiscally responsible,’” said Rep. Mark Walker (R., N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 150 House Republicans.      Conservative groups that had urged Republicans to attach spending curbs to the debt limit criticized the legislation.     “It would be a stretch for voters to think right now that the Republican Party is the party of fiscal discipline,” said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America.      House Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) relied on the votes of House Democrats to clear the bill, as 90 Republicans balked at voting for it. Some Republicans supported it reluctantly, making clear that only the destruction wrought by the hurricanes convinced them to vote yes.     “I hate it,” Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas) said of voting to raise the debt limit. “I’m going to vote for my Texans.”     Frustration over the deal Mr. Trump struck with Democratic leaders bubbled over Friday morning when House Republicans met behind closed doors with Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who had often argued against debt-limit increases with no strings attached when he formerly served in the House.      The two White House officials urged lawmakers to vote for the bill to ensure federal agencies would have sufficient funds amid the natural disasters. House Republicans pushed back, peppering administration officials with questions. specific policy questions and getting what they said were unsatisfying answers.      Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas) asked Mr. Mulvaney whether he could provide assurances that the next increase in the debt limit would be accompanied by deficit-reduction measures. Mr. Mulvaney said he couldn’t provide such assurances, according to people in the room.     “I’m not a happy camper about this process,” Mr. Barton told reporters later.     GOP lawmakers said they were flummoxed when Mr. Mnuchin submitted a personal appeal to “vote for the debt ceiling increase for me.”     House Republicans looked at each other, wondering “what the heck was that?” and waited for a punch line that never came, said Mr. Walker.     The RSC chairman asked Mr. Mnuchin what level the federal debt would reach at its new Dec. 8 deadline.     “He had nothing,” Mr. Walker said. “It did not go well in the conference.”     Government debt hit its statutory limit in mid-March at nearly $20 trillion and Treasury officials have been employing cash-conservation measures since then.      In the meeting, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R., N.Y.)—a Trump supporter—stood up and said Mr. Trump had undercut Mr. Ryan and the Republican conference in Wednesday’s meeting where the deal was reached with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        of California.     “When you’re in that Oval Office meeting and the speaker is there, just know that he was unanimously elected and he represents a conference that is passing one item after another of the agenda and is going to get tax reform done as well,” Mr. Zeldin recounted. “So when a meeting like that takes place, it upsets members who are supportive of the president,” he said, because “you’re creating a new leverage point that potentially favors Democrats.”     Mr. Mulvaney, who was known as one of the most committed fiscal hawks when he served in the House, had some uncomfortable moments in the meeting when his former colleagues suggested he had changed his tune since taking his post in the White House.     Rep.         Darrell Issa    (R., Calif.) asked if he could send dozens of House Republicans to serve as Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies so they could have a similar ideological transformation about the importance of raising the debt limit, GOP lawmakers and aides said.      After the meeting, Mr. Mulvaney declined to answer a reporter’s question about whether he would have voted for the bill had he still been in the House.     “I don’t think it’s a relevant question,” Mr. Mulvaney said, noting that he urged lawmakers to support the bill Friday to ensure federal agencies have sufficient funds for hurricane recovery efforts. “This was an emergency situation. It was absolutely necessary to do it and not the time to have longer discussions about the larger fiscal issues,” he said.     At the meeting’s close, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) stepped in to rally the troops with a speech.     “There were probably a lot of members in there sort of in disbelief,” Rep. Ryan Costello (R., Pa.) said after the meeting. “You have a longtime Democratic donor Treasury Secretary say we as a Republican conference need to vote for this and an OMB director who I don’t believe ever supported a clean debt ceiling,” he said. “It’s kind of like: Where am I right now? What is going on?”     “If it wasn’t so serious, it would kind of be funny,” he said.
