Earlier this week, Guy asked if President Obama’s sweeping executive amnesty order would be handed down sooner rather than later. Originally, most Democrats supposed and hoped he’d at least have the courtesy to wait until after the December Louisiana runoff between Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Bill Cassidy. After all, any type of “poison-the-well” executive action before voters head to the polls would be politically devastating. But now that the Keystone XL Pipeline has gone down in flames and her cause appears to be hopeless, he might be ready to move now.
To wit, the president will be in Las Vegas on Friday, and The Hill reports everything appears to be in place: Could President Obama’s announcement of sweeping new executive action on immigration reform be coming Friday in Las Vegas?
A pair of local media outlets reported late Tuesday night that the president would be making a surprise trip to the city later this week. The Las Vegas Review Journal reported only that Obama was planning a visit, while Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political journalist,tweeted that he was hearing Obama would speak at Del Sol High School. A speech at Del Sol would provide a symbolic bookend on the president’s push for immigration reform. During a speech at the school in January 2013, he declared repeatedly “now is the time” for Congress to enact immigration reform. “We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate,” Obama said in the speech. “We've been debating this a very long time.” Thus the symbolism and location of the visit is unmistakable. In all likelihood, Friday will be a huge news day. Stay tuned.
