NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE      O  	ne of the Oscars last night went to a short film, Two Distant Strangers, about a black guy who keeps getting killed by police, over and over: It was a Black Lives Matter Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day certainly got a workout as a metaphor this past year, didn’t it? It’s almost as if the alarm went off every morning, Sonny and Cher sang, and people just . . . kept . . . talking about the same things. While we were all stuck in the same place. Stuck in time. Stuck in misery.
