WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    renewed his vow to help improve police and community relations in the aftermath of a New York grand jury’s Wednesday decision not to indict a police officer in the death of a Staten Island man.     Wednesday’s decision by the jury “speaks to the larger issues that we’ve been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year and sadly, for decades,” said Mr. Obama, speaking at a Tribal Nations Conference in Washington.      Eric Garner, a Staten Island man, died in July after being restrained in a police choke hold in an incident that was caught on video and widely shared on social media. The decision in New York not to indict the officer comes just one week after a Missouri grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in the August death of an unarmed 18-year old black man in Ferguson, Mo.     “We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said.               As with Ferguson, Mr. Obama declined to comment on the specifics of the Garner case. The president said Attorney General Eric Holder would offer further comment.        
Related        The Ferguson grand jury decision set off nationwide protests and accusations of racial bias in policing and the larger criminal justice system. Activists have held protests in response to the Ferguson situation across the country, and other protest are being organized on social media in response to the Garner decision.     Mr. Obama on Monday brought civil rights leaders, law enforcement, big city mayors and other activists to the White House for a summit on Ferguson to help quell some of the protests that have emerged in cities across the country.     As part of the summit, the Obama administration announced a new commission to examine issues in policing, proposed a pilot program to equip more officers with cameras and promised to draft an executive order reforming the federal program that transfers military equipment to police.
