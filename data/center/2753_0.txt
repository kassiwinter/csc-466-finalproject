CHAMBLEE, Ga.—The unusual attention paid to a special election in Georgia on Tuesday, as well as recent protests around the country over President      Donald Trump’s        tax returns, show the presidential contest didn’t end in November, at least for voters who didn’t support the president.The special election for an Atlanta-area House seat drew extraordinary campaign spending, volumes of political advertising and the attention of Mr. Trump, who recorded automated phone calls and posted Twitter messages in opposition to the leading Democratic candidate,         Jon Ossoff.     The seat, vacated by former Rep.         Tom Price,    who joined the Trump administration as Health and Human Services secretary, has been held by a Republican since 1979, when         Newt Gingrich    took office. A Democratic victory would be widely seen as a sign of strength among voters who oppose Mr. Trump and a signal of potential danger for GOP candidates in the next election.     Mr. Ossoff was holding onto the prospects of an outright win Tuesday night by the narrowest of margins. At 11 p.m., with two-thirds of precincts tallied, he had 50.3% of the vote, just ahead of the share needed to avoid a runoff. Republican         Karen Handel    was in second place, with about 18% of the vote.               While Mr. Price carried 62% of the vote in his 2016 re-election, Mr. Trump won the district by about 1 point. Sensing a chance to win, Democratic activists from around the nation zeroed in the race, to make the election a referendum on the president’s first few months in office.     “Trump really lit a fire under me personally,” said Sharon Courtney, outside her polling location at the Warren Technical School in Chamblee. Ms. Courtney, who both voted for Mr. Ossoff and canvassed for him, said the election was an opportunity to send a message to Mr. Trump that she doesn’t approve of his presidency.     The influx of out-of-state money and volunteers for Mr. Ossoff irritated some Republican voters. Karen Stroer, a 56-year-old sales representative who lives in Dunwoody, said Mr. Ossoff’s campaign was “people trying to buy an election. When someone spends that much money it’s very wrong.”      She said she voted for Republican Tom Gray in part because he didn’t have much experience in politics. She felt that if the Republicans can force a runoff against Mr. Ossoff, they would win a June election by all getting behind one candidate.                                                 Voters cast their ballots in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District special election on Tuesday.

With support from Democrats beyond the district, the Ossoff campaign raised $8.3 million in the first quarter from donors across the country. Republican groups spent more than $5 million attacking Mr. Ossoff.     In Tuesday’s “jungle primary’’ format, 18 candidates from both parties, as well as independents, appear on a single ballot. The top two finishers move to a runoff, unless one candidate draws more than 50% of the vote.     The election in Georgia comes just after thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in several cities to demand that Mr. Trump release his tax returns. The president has refused to release the documents, unlike previous presidents and presidential nominees.     The rallies were dismissed by Mr. Trump, who wrote on         Twitter    that someone should “look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday,” adding “the election is over!”                                         On Tuesday, Georgia holds a special election to fill the House seat left vacant by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Democrats see the election as a chance to win a seat from the Republicans and make a statement about Donald Trump. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains how it could pan out.

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D., N.Y.) said, “The level of energy that is being created in these districts gives us more solace that in 2018 we’re going to have even much more enthusiasm.”     But due in part to low voter turnout and other unusual circumstances, special elections can be poor indicators of how the next general election will turn out. In 2010, a Democratic victory in a special election for a House seat from Pennsylvania was broadly read as a sign that Republicans would likely struggle the following November. But the GOP went on to gain more than 60 seats that year and take control of the House.     Republicans are favored in two special elections to replace Trump cabinet members next month in Montana and South Carolina. A Republican won a special election in Kansas last week.     Susan Sullivan, who voted for Mr. Ossoff, said disapproval of Mr. Trump has sparked unprecedented Democratic activity in the area. “There’s a lot more activism for Jon Ossoff and the Democratic Party than there has ever been before here,” she said.
