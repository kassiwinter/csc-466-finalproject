         Jeb Bush,    the son and brother of past presidents, kick-started the 2016 presidential race Tuesday by announcing plans to “actively explore” a presidential campaign, an unexpectedly early declaration that ramps up pressure on potential rivals and reshuffles the policy debate. The move by the 61-year-old former Florida governor essentially marks the beginning of the presidential sweepstakes. With a national profile, access to big donors and iconic status in the nation’s largest swing state,         Mr. Bush’s    move puts instant pressure on a sprawling field of as many as two dozen other Republicans weighing 2016 bids. His online announcement amounts to a pre-emptive strike against efforts by New Jersey Gov.         Chris Christie    and allies of the 2012 GOP nominee,         Mitt Romney,    to lock in major donors or at least keep them on the sidelines.     Mr. Bush’s step toward a campaign also threatens to undermine the aspirations of Florida Sen.         Marco Rubio,    his onetime protégé, who shares the same home state and an overlapping political network there.           More           “I think Jeb is trying to clear the field,” said         Bobbie Kilberg,    a prominent Republican donor who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush’s father, President George H.W. Bush. “He’s now gotten out ahead of everyone else, and I think this may force other candidates to move earlier than they had wanted to.”               Mr. Bush’s potential candidacy also has implications for the expected Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. His younger GOP rivals could try to make the case for going in a different direction by lumping Mr. Bush and Mrs. Clinton together as tired figures from the past. That argument, however, would lose its potency in a general election match-up between Mr. Bush and Mrs. Clinton.     Mr. Bush said he would set up a political action committee in January to “promote leaders, ideas and policies.” A PAC also allows him to raise money, hire staff and reach grass-roots supporters, setting up the kind of political apparatus that many potential rivals have been building for months. The next step would be for Mr. Bush to set up an exploratory committee, and aides stressed that he hasn’t made a final decision. Still, the move was a big step in that direction.                                                 Jeb Bush listens at the National Summit on Education Reform in Washington last month.          Associated Press                                                                                                             In Florida, Mr. Bush governed as a social and fiscal conservative, though he has broken with his party’s conservative base on immigration and education policy—two issues likely to figure prominently in the Republican primary. He has advocated a broad immigration overhaul, including legal status for some immigrants here illegally, and has championed national Common Core education standards, viewed with suspicion by his party’s conservative wing.     He also has advocated an aggressive U.S. role in foreign affairs and may be pressed to defend the Iraq war effort pursued by his brother, President         George W. Bush.    One potential 2016 GOP candidate, Sen.         Rand Paul    of Kentucky, has questioned the wisdom of that war, setting up a debate over intervention abroad with a personal overtone.                                         The 2016 race has begun, starting with Jeb Bush and his decision to start exploring a presidential run. WSJ’s Jerry Seib explains what this means for the rest of the field.

Most Republicans, though, have supported the interrogations, blunting the impact of that in a party primary setting.     The broader question is whether the Bush family name is an asset or a liability. “I can’t see the country electing another Bush,” said Sen. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) “There’s still hard feelings about George W. So you start out with a negative because you’ve got the wrong last name. If he didn’t have that last name, he’d be a pretty good candidate.”     Still, much of the Republican Party’s establishment was waiting for a positive sign from Mr. Bush. Jack Oliver, a longtime fundraiser for the Bush family, said, “My in-box imploded with excitement from people all over the county who are excited about the possibility of Jeb running.”           Earlier           Mr. Bush has sent a number of signals in recent weeks that seemed aimed at batting down the notion that he is a figure from the past. He posted his decision on         Facebook    and         Twitter    —two platforms that didn’t exist when he last ran for office in 2002. On Sunday, he said he would release 250,000 emails from his two terms as governor, noting that he “was digital before digital was cool.”     Yet Mr. Bush came of age in a time before political blogs, Twitter and video trackers could blow up a tiny misstep into an international incident. The fundraising landscape has also been transformed to include online fundraising geared toward small donors and super PACS floated by multimillionaires.     Mr. Bush and a small circle of allies have been quietly reaching out to donors and potential campaign staffers for weeks, but his public declaration on Tuesday served as a loud warning shot.     “It puts a wrench in the plans of anyone who wants to milk this process and start running in July,” said         Craig Robinson,    who runs the Iowa Republican, a popular website in the state hosting the first nominating contest.     Mr. Rubio’s team immediately sought to quash any speculation that he would bow out. “Marco has a lot of respect for Gov. Bush and believes he would be a formidable candidate,” said Rubio spokesman         Alex Conant.    “However, Marco’s decision on whether to run for president or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda and restore the American Dream—not on who else might be running.”     Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for Mr. Christie, declined to comment on Mr. Bush’s declaration Tuesday.     “If Christie decides not to run, I don’t think it will be because Jeb jumped in,” said Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot Inc. and a prominent Christie supporter. “Jeb will raise a lot of money, and I think Chris will raise a lot of money.”     Mr. Bush would begin the race facing a fairly skeptical public. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found some 57% of adults who said they overall couldn’t see themselves supporting him, compared with 31% who said they could.      But among Republicans, 55% said they could see themselves supporting him, with 34% saying they could not. Only Mitt Romney recorded stronger numbers among the major Republican rivals in the survey.      “The Bush brand took a significant hit under George W. Bush, and the negatives associated with Bush 43’s legacy,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster who was a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign. “At the very least, [Jeb Bush] will be under a special burden to separate himself from his brother, and that will be very hard to do.”     Mr. Bush, a fluent Spanish speaker with a degree in Latin American studies and strong ties to Florida’s Hispanic community, is well-positioned to expand his party’s reach to an increasingly diverse electorate.     He has suggested in recent interviews that he wouldn’t back down from positions on education and immigration policy to appease conservative critics. Mr. Romney took a hard line against illegal immigration during the 2012 primary and was soundly rejected by Hispanic voters in the general election.     At The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council gathering earlier this month, Mr. Bush said his decision on running would depend on whether he has “the skills to do it in a way that tries to lift people’s spirits and not get sucked into the vortex.” He added at the time: “I don’t know if I would be a good candidate or a bad one, but I kinda know how a Republican could win, whether it’s me or somebody else, and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to…lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.”     David Axelrod, a top adviser to President         Barack Obama’s    two presidential campaigns, said Tuesday that Mr. Bush would make a “formidable general-election candidate,” if he doesn’t retreat from his positions.     “The problem is in order to get the nomination, they have to make Faustian bargains on issues that take them to the right,” Mr. Axelrod said on MSNBC. “If Jeb sticks to his guns on these issues, he’s got tremendous appeal to the Hispanic community; he could be a very formidable candidate.”     Katon Dawson, a longtime Republican operative in South Carolina, said Mr. Bush would enter the race with an established network of supporters in that state, home of an early primary, but cautioned that his name alone wouldn’t be enough to lock up the nomination.     “I don’t think the rock-solid conservatives are going to let Jeb or anyone else have it for free,” Mr. Dawson said.     —Reid J.
