Earlier this year it secured a win that blocked Biden’s attempt to pause deportations for his first 100 days in office.Last week the state also sued over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy changes reducing reliance on "detainers" that allow ICE officials to request local authorities hold foreign nationals for up to 48 hours after their sentences are scheduled to end.The Trump administration faced a number of suits challenging the legality of its so-called Remain in Mexico policy, including a suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration advocacy groups slated to be heard by the Supreme Court.The Biden administration in February convinced the Supreme Court to cancel the hearing based on its commitment to replacing the policy.
