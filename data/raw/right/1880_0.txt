                 | March 14, 2021 05:20 PM                President Biden reaffirmed his commitment to a "free, open" Indo-Pacific region to his fellow "Quad" leaders after the four convened for the first time on Friday.      In a joint Saturday op-ed in the Washington Post authored by Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the four leaders of the intercontinental Quad alliance outlined what they view as the key challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region and reaffirmed their commitment to one another.            "We are proud to announce ... bold steps — and eager to begin the work our countries must undertake to achieve them. Ending and recovering from the pandemic, standing up to climate change, and advancing our shared regional vision will not be easy ... but in this dark hour, our partnership offers a spark of hope to light the path ahead," the world leaders wrote, later adding that they recommit themselves, "once again, to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure and prosperous."      'NOTHING IS MORE GLOBALLY IMPORTANT': US AND QUAD ALLIES HATCH PLAN TO PRODUCE 1 BILLION VACCINES      Biden, Modi, Morrison, and Suga pointed to climate change as a particular cause of concern for the region.      "It is clear that climate change is both a strategic priority and an urgent global challenge, including for the Indo-Pacific region," they wrote. "That’s why we will work together and with others to strengthen the Paris agreement, and enhance the climate actions of all nations."      The four also mentioned the global COVID-19 pandemic, which they termed "among the greatest risks to health and economic stability in recent history."      "With an unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our people, we are determined to end the COVID-19 pandemic because no country will be safe so long as the pandemic continues. ... The promises we make today must translate into a healthier and more prosperous Indo-Pacific tomorrow," they wrote.      The countries are advancing a plan to produce as many as 1 billion vaccines over the next year.      “Nothing is more globally important, obviously, right now than the Quad leaders coming together on a deliverable to expand vaccine manufacturing and delivery towards ending the pandemic,” a senior administration official told reporters.      China, which fears the Quad may operate as a "mini-NATO," has countered via “vaccine diplomacy” in an effort to cultivate allies in other countries. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte accepted a shipment of vaccines from China last month, creating concern among some Republicans who question China's motives.
