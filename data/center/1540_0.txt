         Two important battleground states certified election results Monday, with Wisconsin and Arizona handing narrow victories to President-elect Joe Biden and further cementing his win over President         Trump.         With Arizona and Wisconsin’s vote counts finalized, the six most hotly contested battleground states have all certified their results for Mr. Biden. The others are Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada. Mr. Trump hasn’t conceded the race and has contested the outcome in those states.      In Arizona, Monday’s certified election results showed that Mr. Biden won Arizona’s 11 electoral votes with a popular-vote margin of just over 10,000.     Arizona Secretary of State         Katie Hobbs,    a Democrat, signed the official canvas documents alongside two Republican state officials,         Gov. Doug Ducey    and Attorney General         Mark Brnovich,    and the chief judge of Arizona’s Supreme Court,         Robert Brutinel,    a Republican appointee.                Arizona voters last backed a Democrat for president in 1996.     Wisconsin also certified election results Monday when the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission signed the latest vote tally after recounts in the state’s two most populous counties, Milwaukee and Dane, which includes Madison.     The Trump campaign paid about $3 million for a recount in only two of the state’s 72 counties. In the end, Mr. Biden’s lead in the state ended up at around 20,000 votes after his lead grew by 84 votes.     The Trump campaign and its supporters have said they are considering further legal action. Mr. Trump tweeted over the weekend that more challenges would be coming after Wisconsin’s recount. Judges have so far rejected their lawsuits.        
More on the Transition        Both Wisconsin and Arizona allow legal challenges post-certification.     Senior Trump legal adviser         Jenna Ellis    criticized the Arizona certification Monday on Twitter, calling it misconduct that has disenfranchised the state’s voters.     ”The legislature MUST ACT to stop this blatant corruption!” she said, calling on state lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors to the Electoral College, which meets on Dec. 14 to officially cast its votes.     Also on Monday, President Trump’s lawyers asked Arizona’s Republican lawmakers to override the certification at an event they billed as an election-integrity hearing.     At the hearing, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney         Rudy Giuliani    spoke about voter fraud, voting irregularities and foreign-owned voting systems, airing similar conspiracy theories to those voiced by attorney Sidney Powell at a recent news conference with Trump advisers in Washington. The campaign later distanced itself from Ms. Powell, saying she wasn’t a member of Mr. Trump’s legal team.      No evidence of widespread fraud has emerged. Federal officials have said the election was carried out freely and without interference or rigging.      Ms. Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, said voter turnout was nearly 80%, with 3.4 million ballots cast.     “This election was conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness, in accordance with Arizona’s laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims for the contrary,” Ms. Hobbs said Monday.                                         Joe Biden, on his third run for the presidency, defeated President Donald Trump, the Associated Press reports. WSJ’s Jason Bellini reports on his path to victory.
