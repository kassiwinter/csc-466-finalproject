                                                                                                                                         Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal popularity has slipped over the past couple years, but she still has a higher favorable rating then a half dozen of her potential GOP rivals for president in 2016, a Washington Post/ABC News poll said.                                                                                                                                                      The survey found that 49 percent of respondents view Mrs. Clinton in a positive light — down from 67 percent more than two years ago — and 46 percent view her unfavorably, as she lays the ground work for a presidential bid.                                                                                                                                                      “Yet Clinton still is better off than six potential GOP candidates tested in this survey,” the survey analysis said.                                                                                                                                                                    Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s favorable-unfavorable rating sits at 33-53 percent, compared to 26-61 percent for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.                                                                                                                   “Compared with Clinton, more Americans have yet to form an opinion of Bush. Christie or, especially the others tested in this poll, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker,” the analysis said. “Still, Cruz’s favorability rating, like Bush’s, is underwater by 20 points, Rubio’s by 14, Paul’s by 13 and Walker’s — the least known — by 7.”
