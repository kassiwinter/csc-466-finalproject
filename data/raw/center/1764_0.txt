WASHINGTON—         Hillary Clinton    was once seen as a liberal voice pulling her husband and party to the left. Today, on the brink of her announcement that she is running for president, some Democrats think she isn’t liberal enough.What troubles them are her ties to Wall Street and         Bill Clinton’s    centrist economic record. They don’t like that she appears more comfortable with bipartisan compromise than populist calls to fight banks and other business interests, and wonder if she stands with them on other issues. “There’s a general uncertainty of where she stands on key economic issues,” said         Roger Hickey,    co-chairman of the liberal advocacy group Campaign for America’s Future. “A lot of people would prefer to have someone who is a real populist crusader, who is clear about what she would do.”           Such dissatisfaction poses a challenge for Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to announce her candidacy as soon as this weekend and is currently the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination. If she tacks left during the primary season to satisfy liberals, it could hurt her prospects in a general election. But if she ignores liberal pressure and doesn’t craft a message that excites all Democrats, it could hurt turnout for her in the general election.               “The whole dynamic in primaries is to push candidates toward positions that the base, or elements of the base, want them to represent or reflect,” said         Chris Kofinis,    a Democratic strategist who worked on two presidential-primary campaigns. The challenge for presidential candidates in both parties, he says, is: “How do you balance reflecting some of the concerns of the base without alienating the voters that you need to win the general election?”     Democrats who want a contested primary also have pointed to the controversy around Mrs. Clinton’s decision to use a personal email account during her four years as secretary of state. The uproar, they say, shows it is risky for Democrats to depend on one candidate this early in the race.     Republican candidates also face a challenge in trying satisfy the party base without alienating too many other voters. Former Florida governor and likely candidate         Jeb Bush,    for one, has so far resisted some pressure from the right, vowing to stick with his support for an immigration overhaul and education standards that are unpopular with the party’s conservative wing.     Polls show Mrs. Clinton far ahead of all potential rivals for the Democratic nomination. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in March, 87% of liberals who plan to vote in a Democratic primary said they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton.     Clinton spokesman         Nick Merrill    says Mrs. Clinton is committed to the same issues being pushed by liberals. “Reducing inequality and increasing upward mobility has been an uninterrupted pursuit of hers through every job she’s held and continues to this day,” he says. “And if she gets in the race, her message will reflect that work and the values that inform it.”     Nevertheless, the yearning in some quarters for a more populist candidate has spawned an effort to draft Sen.         Elizabeth Warren    (D., Mass.), who casts the financial-services sector as a villain and describes the nation’s political and economic systems as favoring the powerful. Ms. Warren has said she won’t run, but she has stopped short of embracing a Clinton candidacy. Pro-Warren groups are opening offices in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the nominating contest will begin early next year.      On Thursday, former Rhode Island Gov.         Lincoln Chafee    made a surprise announcement that he plans to run, staking out a position on the left on foreign policy, and attacked Mrs. Clinton as overly hawkish and unaccomplished as secretary of state. “I don’t think we should have a president of the United States who voted for the huge mistake that is the Iraq war, and certainly we shouldn’t have a Democratic nominee who voted for the war,” he said.     Former Maryland Gov.         Martin O’Malley    has sharpened his criticism of Wall Street as he considers a run. During his first trip to Iowa last month, he called for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking whose repeal was signed by President Clinton.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. O’Malley also decried economic inequality. “Until we solve this problem, we cannot rest,” he said. “Not as a party and not as a people.”      In recent months, Mrs. Clinton has held meetings with economists and policy specialists to write a plan that addresses the sluggish wage growth that bedevils many households. Yet she doesn’t want that message to sound divisive or to cast corporations as villains, people familiar with the matter said.      “I would like to bring people from right, left, red, blue, get them into a nice warm purple space where everybody is talking and where we’re actually trying to solve problems,” she said at a conference in February when asked her thoughts about running for president.     Liberal reservations about Mrs. Clinton stem in part from her past association with the centrist economic advisers and policies of her husband’s administration, particularly his support for free trade and a welfare overhaul that ended a federal guarantee of aid to the poor. Mrs. Clinton supported the welfare changes, and has spoken favorably about some free-trade deals.                                                 Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee said Thursday he plans to run.

Elizabeth Warren has said she won’t run.

Martin O'Malley, a critic of Wall Street, is mulling a run.

As a young lawyer, she worked for the Children’s Defense Fund and Legal Aid, both advocates for the poor. When Bill Clinton was Arkansas governor, she was a proponent of education and rural health care. After her husband was elected president, she was the driving force behind his unsuccessful plan for universal health care.     As a U.S. senator from 2001 until 2009 and as a presidential candidate in 2007 and 2008, she called for universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families.     In 2007, she proposed taxing “carried interest,” the money made by many investment-fund managers, at regular rates instead of the lower capital-gains rate. The same year, she went to Wall Street and said the financial-services industry was to blame for a “significant” amount of the housing and financial crisis that was about to explode. She also lamented economic inequality in the nation and proposed nine ways to attacking the problem.     But some liberals are still angry about her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war, a major vulnerability in her 2008 campaign. She said last year it was the wrong call. Inside the         Obama    administration, she also often struck a hawkish stance, such as favoring arming Syrian rebels at an early stage in the conflict.     Others point to her connections to Wall Street. As of last summer, she and her husband had helped raise more than $1 billion from U.S. companies and industry donors over two decades, including for campaigns, through paid speeches and in donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the family’s large charitable organization, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.     After leaving the State Department two years ago, Mrs. Clinton began giving paid speeches, sometimes collecting $200,000 or more from corporate entities. At a 2013 event sponsored by the Wall Street bank         Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,    she said she wasn’t interested in “turning the clock back or pointing fingers” regarding the causes of the financial crisis, according to two people in the room, though she also spoke favorably about the Dodd-Frank legislation adding new regulations to Wall Street.                                                                                                                                                      “She’s been in a position where she’s wooed every day by the big money, and it’s hard not to be swayed by that,” says         Ken Mertes,    chairman of the Monona County, Iowa, Democrats.     As a senator, Mrs. Clinton gravitated toward legislation with bipartisan support that was considered achievable, such as a 2003 deal reached with then-Sen.         Don Nickles    (R., Okla.) that extended unemployment benefits, but not as much as she and other Democrats initially had hoped.     Liberals are particularly critical of her 2001 vote for a bankruptcy overhaul promoted by the credit-card and banking industries that would have made it more difficult for people to get relief from debts through bankruptcy. As first lady, Mrs. Clinton had opposed a similar proposal. She said the bill she later supported had been improved.      Critics of the bill included Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor. She accused Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, of becoming reliant on campaign donations from banks. “Big banks were now part of Sen. Clinton’s constituency,” Ms. Warren wrote in a 2003 book. “She wanted their support, and they wanted hers.”     The bill failed, but a similar measure passed in 2005. Mrs. Clinton missed that vote, she said, because her husband had been hospitalized for a heart ailment. She said she would have voted no.     During a presidential-primary debate in 2008, she was asked if she regretted her 2001 yes vote. “Sure I do, but it never became law,” she said.      Some liberals are bothered by Mrs. Clinton’s position on free trade. Organized labor has opposed free-trade deals, seeing them as ways to help companies find cheaper labor abroad.     As a senator, she voted for trade deals with Singapore, Chile and Oman. She opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement, in part, she said, because it didn’t include protections for U.S. workers.     Her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by her husband, is harder to pin down. Mr. Clinton’s White House saw Nafta as a major achievement. Mrs. Clinton’s 2003 book, “Living History,” described Nafta in laudatory terms.     As a candidate in 2008, she sounded more skeptical, saying that “the way it’s been implemented has hurt a lot of American workers.” She described herself as a proponent of “smart trade…pro-American trade.”     The trade issue could get attention as negotiations conclude over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal among 11 Pacific nations that President Barack Obama is pushing but labor unions sharply oppose. Mrs. Clinton’s position isn’t clear.      Liberal Democrats are likely to continue pressing to get Mrs. Clinton to embrace their issues and positions, believing the nominating process is the moment when their influence is strongest. But the lack of competition now will only help Mrs. Clinton if she is the nominee, said Dick Batchelor, a former state legislator from Orlando who expects to help raise money for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.     “Traditionally the Democrats run to the left to get the nomination, then they’ve got to scurry back to the middle,” he says. “She doesn’t have to scurry back to the middle. She’s already there.”     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8
