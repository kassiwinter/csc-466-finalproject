WASHINGTON—The House defeated a Republican-written farm bill on Friday after GOP leaders couldn’t win over a bloc of their party’s most conservative lawmakers, who were demanding a separate vote soon on a measure to toughen immigration enforcement.The conservatives, members of the House Freedom Caucus, broke with their party even as leaders tried to persuade them that an immigration measure they wanted to bring to the floor would come up in June as part of a series of other immigration votes. The group instead wanted an immediate vote on a specific bill that would reduce legal immigration and add enforcement measures. As a result, the farm bill was defeated, with 198 lawmakers in favor and 213 opposed. Thirty Republicans joined 183 Democrats in opposition.     House GOP leaders needed most Republicans to stay on board because Democrats had already opposed the bill, objecting to new work requirements that would be imposed on food-stamp recipients.               House Republican leaders have for years faced divisions within their conference—a split that led to the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner in 2015. The Freedom Caucus, which has an estimated three dozen members, has often asserted its clout against an establishment leadership it believes is too willing to cut deals with Democrats.     The farm bill, which gets renewed about every five years, funds crop insurance and offers payments to farmers when prices or revenues drop below set levels for major commodities like wheat and corn. It also funds programs to help low-income people pay for groceries.

At that point, if Congress hasn’t passed a new farm bill, lawmakers would need an extension to maintain funding for farm-safety-net programs. Without the new legislation, funding would lapse for dozens of smaller programs, including assistance to new farmers, trade and rural development. On the House floor on Friday, Speaker         Paul Ryan    made a motion to bring the measure back up for a vote, although timing is uncertain.     The White House in a statement Friday said President      Donald Trump        was disappointed in the vote and urged the House to resolve the issues. “The Administration underscores the need to bring certainty to our farmers and ranchers and to the many Americans receiving food assistance, and will continue to work with Congress to pass a Farm bill on time,” it said.     Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, said both sides should return to the table and “fix” the bill. “We don’t have to let this process be held hostage by the demands of the extremes of our parties,” he said.              Rep. Mike Conaway    (R., Texas), chairman of the Agriculture Committee, called the vote “a setback” but that lawmakers would deliver a farm bill on time. “We may be down, but we are not out,” he said.     The farm bill has historically drawn bipartisan support from a swath of urban and rural lawmakers. But in recent years its passage has been marked by bruising partisan battles over nutrition assistance to low-income Americans. Five years ago, when the latest farm bill was being debated, a coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans sank an early version of the measure on the House floor over its spending levels and cuts to the food-stamp program.     But the jockeying over the past week was more about immigration than about farm programs. Members of the Freedom Caucus felt compelled to act because a group of centrists had mounted an effort, called a discharge petition, that would force a set of immigration bills to the House floor. Many of the centrists are facing difficult re-election battles in areas with large immigrant populations and want to show their independence from a Republican Party that has left many foreign-born people in legal limbo.      GOP leaders oppose that process because it could result in passage of a bill that is opposed by the majority of Republicans. The effort would have included a vote on a bill sponsored by         Rep. Bob Goodlatte    (R., Va.) that the Freedom Caucus members wanted that isn’t believed to have enough support to pass the House. That bill would add enforcement measures, cut legal immigration and provide legal status to about 690,000 people now enrolled in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.     The Freedom Caucus wanted the vote on the Goodlatte bill immediately, not as part of the series of other immigration votes in June.      “You are asked to put up a vote now for a promise in the future that is somewhat vague, and unfortunately too many of our members have been left standing at the altar too many times with those kind of promises and they’re not willing to commit to it,” said Rep. Scott Perry (R., Pa.), a Freedom Caucus member who voted against the bill.      The defeat left in the balance the fate of the farm bill, which supporters have portrayed as crucial for farmers, who are navigating a multiyear downturn in the agricultural economy that has pushed some out of business. A string of bumper crops in the U.S. and abroad in recent years drove a global glut of grain, which halved prices of key crops like corn and wheat and touched off the steepest farm slump in decades. U.S. net farm income this year is forecast to fall 7% to the lowest in 12 years, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.     Champions of the bill have also warned of repercussions for farmers from international trade disputes. Tariffs announced by China on some U.S. agricultural goods, and the threat of more, have slowed the flow of U.S. commodities like soybeans and pork to the major Asian market, spreading fear through America’s Farm Belt.     Meanwhile, food-stamp enrollment has dropped to 40 million from a peak of nearly 48 million recipients in 2013, amid an improving economy, and the average monthly benefit is also down, at $123, federal figures show.     Critics of farm subsidies and proposed cuts to the food-stamp program cheered the bill’s defeat, saying the House should revise the legislation to address their concerns.     “The most important thing that happened in the House today was the defeat of this toxic bill,” said the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, an advocacy group that argues against subsidies going to wealthy farmers.     “Our city’s soup kitchens and food pantries already run short of food, and cannot fill in the gap” if food stamps are cut, said         Margarette Purvis,    president of the Food Bank For New York City.     —Laura Meckler and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.
