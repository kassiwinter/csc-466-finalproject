An exact settlement amount has not yet been disclosed, but MGM Resorts International has previously said in financial filings that it expects to pay up to $800 million to victims of the mass shooting, sources told ABC News.
Fifty-eight people were slain Oct. 1, 2017, when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip. Hundreds of others were injured.
The shooting, which targeted 22,000 concertgoers at a country music festival, lasted nearly 11 minutes before Paddock killed himself as police closed in.
Authorities have said the 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player meticulously planned the attack — though a clear motive has never been established.
Police recovered 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with since-outlawed bump stock attachments that allowed the firearms to fire rapidly like machine guns.
Hundreds of lawsuits were filed in the wake of the shooting spree by families of victims who claimed MGM, which owns the Mandalay Bay, did nothing to prevent Paddock from bringing the weapons into the hotel.
MGM countersued in a legal tactic designed to consolidate the victims’ suits into one case in federal court.
News of the potential settlement comes on the second anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
MGM declined to comment to ABC News.
