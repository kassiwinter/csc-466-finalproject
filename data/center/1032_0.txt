The U.S. job market finished 2012 chugging along in the same low gear of the past two years, stoking nervousness over sluggish economic growth ahead as new risks from Washington loom over the coming weeks. Employers added 155,000 jobs in December, in line with the average gains of 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey of households, sat at 7.8%, with the labor force rebounding from a drop tied to superstorm Sandy a month earlier.

More on Jobs           The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.85 on Friday to close at 13435.21, capping its best weekly performance since December 2011 with a surge of nearly 500 points that was fueled by a deal to avert across-the-board federal tax increases and spending cuts. The S&P 500 closed Friday at a five-year high.     But the latest jobs data indicated little potential for accelerated hiring in the new year. Growth is expected at best to continue at a moderate 2% pace, barring new shocks to the economy. Prospects for a stronger upturn, at least in the first half of 2013, remain slim. Many economists worry about losing even more ground, especially as lawmakers launch a potentially risky political battle this winter over raising the federal debt ceiling.               The U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.6% from 1950 through 1999 but has since slowed to less than 2%, prompting an economic debate over whether the post-World War II boom can again be duplicated.       Since the recession ended 3½ years ago, economists have been divided over long-run growth prospects after the downturn pushed millions of Americans out of the labor force. Looking forward five to 10 years, the argument goes, annual U.S. growth may reach a ceiling of 3% and unemployment could settle at a rate above the 5.7% annual average recorded during the last half of the 20th century.      "It certainly looks like we've had a permanent shock" in the wake of the housing-market bust and resulting recession, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser told a gathering of economists Friday in San Diego. Untangling the causes and results of the financial crisis could take years, he said.      Minutes of the central bank's latest meeting released this week showed Fed concerns over new risks to the economy by Washington lawmakers. Almost all Fed policy makers "indicated that heightened uncertainty about fiscal policy was probably affecting economic activity adversely," according to the minutes, reducing the confidence of businesses and households, and leading firms to defer hiring and investment.           A Historical ViewU.S. unemployment since 1948           Friday's employment data showed a sharp divide in the U.S. labor market: The private sector added jobs at a healthy pace, while government job losses continued, particularly among state and local governments. The private sector added about 1.9 million jobs in 2012, while the loss of 63,000 government jobs over 12 months marked the fourth year of public-sector job cuts.     In the private sector, businesses remained reluctant to spend much of the corporate cash piling up on the sidelines during the weak recovery.              AutoNation Inc.    chief executive Mike Jackson is still waiting for better signs. Although "certain building blocks are falling into place," including the continuing the automotive rebound, a budding housing recovery and economic strength in such areas as Texas, the U.S. needs economic growth of more than 3% "to address the unemployment situation in America," he said.     Mr. Jackson has forecast "modest head-count increases going forward as our sales increase," but said the company hasn't needed much hiring in recent months, in part because of improving productivity.          The U.S. economy is expected to take a sizable hit from one piece of the so-called fiscal cliff deal approved by Congress this week. While the agreement averted broad income-tax increases and spending cuts, consumers will see take-home pay shrink this month after expiration of a payroll tax break, increasing the withholding for Social Security to 6.2% from 4.2%. Smaller paychecks are expected to dampen consumer spending and the economy, even with a quick resolution of the looming debt ceiling fight.     The private sector would be "poised for strong growth if left to its own devices," said J.P. Morgan chief economist         Bruce Kasman.    "We certainly avoided the worst fears around the cliff. But we still have a large, front-loaded drag ahead of us" from the higher payroll tax and other potential government-spending cuts ahead.     The jobs report suggested Americans brushed off the threat of the fiscal cliff, at least through the middle of December, when the employment surveys were conducted. Businesses also largely appear to have looked past the threat of diminished government spending and political dysfunction. The Institute for Supply Management's latest gauge of the service sector, released Friday, hit its highest point since February, a sign firms are boosting activity despite waning confidence in recent months. The measure rose to 56.1, up 1.4 points, with a gauge of service-sector employment also leaping higher.     "Uncertainty is what makes people sit on their hands a bit when they're wavering," said Anthony Nieves, chairman of the survey. "But ultimately they need to make decisions and move forward, not dwell on what decisions haven't been made."     Businesses reported resilience among customers during the Christmas shopping season that began the day after Thanksgiving, giving hope for momentum in 2013.     Friday's jobs report showed gains across most sectors in December, with the private sector adding 168,000 jobs, offset by a loss of 13,000 government jobs. Manufacturers added 25,000 positions, though jobs in the sector remain about 1.8 million below prerecession levels. Construction saw an uplift after Sandy, with an increase of 30,000 jobs.      Workers saw other gains. The number of hours worked was higher, boosting paychecks in the final month of the year.     Café Imports, a Minneapolis importer of specialty coffees, experienced "very strong" sales during the holidays, said Tim Chapdelaine, vice president of sales.                                                                                                                                                     The 27-person firm posted a job opening last week for an entry-level customer service representative and 15 people have applied. "We've gotten mostly people with college degrees and even one M.B.A.," Mr. Chapdelaine said. In 2011, a job posted online drew 200 applicants.      With slow growth, the number of Americans idling on the sidelines remains substantial.     About 12.2 million people are jobless and looking for work, about 4.8 million of them for six months or more. Millions more have stopped looking or are working part-time when they want full-time work. Joblessness is 14.4% when including those people.      Spero Wallace, who lost his job last February at an Atlantic City casino, checks online every day for jobs. He said he would have moved to another state if he didn't have to care for his ailing 79-year-old mother. Earlier this week, the Navy veteran visited a Veterans Affairs office and found a lead for a school-custodian job. "I'm frustrated," said Mr. Wallace, 53 years old and unemployed for the first time in 22 years. "But I feel confident that it's going to come."     —Kate Linebaugh, Michael S.
