House after house had been flattened or badly damaged, with roofs or walls missing. Large trees have been uprooted from the ground and power poles bent right over, leaving power lines strewn across the ground.”He added: “In some areas where the eye of the storm hit, it seems as if nothing has been left undamaged.”The typhoon affected 250,000 people in Luzon, according to the government’s natural disaster council.
