That was what he did on Thursday, using a White House address to announce that he would reach his goal of having 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots administered to Americans on Friday, well ahead of schedule.“I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans,” Biden said. “That’s weeks ahead of schedule.”Biden had promised to hit the mark on his 100th day in office, at the end of April, but with about 2.5 million people being vaccinated daily — up from about 900,000 daily doses during the last week of the Trump presidency — he will be able to fulfill that promise 42 days early.President Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House on Thursday.

Meanwhile, new variants of the coronavirus proliferate. Those variants could be helped along as governors lift restrictions across the country.As he has on previous occasions, Biden held out the hope of a quasi-normal Independence Day, one he said Americans would be able to mark, if all went well in the intervening months, with small backyard barbecues.____Read more from Yahoo News:How March 11, 2020, marked the start of the COVID eraHe helped Trump bring American hostages home.
