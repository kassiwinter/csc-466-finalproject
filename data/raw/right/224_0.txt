                           Joe Biden is the country's 46th president.
Once one of Congress's youngest senators, Biden, 78, will be the oldest president sworn into office after Ronald Reagan left the White House in 1989 at the age of 77.
President Barack Obama's two-term vice president and Delaware's 36-year senator won the White House after lackluster early primary results in a crowded field and a quiet general election schedule amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Though a millionaire now, he appealed to the country by drawing on his experience growing up in a middle-class, Irish Catholic family in Pennsylvania and Delaware. He also shared his brushes with personal tragedy, including the loss of his first wife Neilia and 1-year-old daughter Naomi in 1972, as well as his eldest son Beau in 2015.
On the trail, he spoke of hoping to be "an American president" but is bracing for partisan fights over his administration's nominees and a virus-related economic relief package. He, too, expects pressure from the Democratic Party's ascendant Left.
