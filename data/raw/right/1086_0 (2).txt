 Hard work and a good attitude go a long way in life, entitlement does not. Meet 11-year old Madison Root from Portland, Oregon. In an effort to pay for her braces, Root collected mistletoe and tried to sell it in a public park. Because she didn't a have a license, she was told to stop due to being in violation of city ordinance. Last night, Root explained on The Kelly File. 
"What made me so mad about that is that he said I could beg, but I couldn't work hard and sell. What has society really come to? Teaching these kids to beg instead of work hard and sell?" Root said. "That's what I believe in, work ethic."  
To all of the fast food workers on strike today demanding a $15 minimum wage, take note.
