                                                  Republican candidate Donald Trump addresses motorcyclists on Sunday participating in Rolling Thunder, the annual ride around Washington Mall to raise awareness for prisoners of war and soldiers still missing in action.

The presumptive Republican nominee for president found a friendly crowd here after a week in which protesters and the press questioned his promises to help veterans.      “We’re going to rebuild our military and we’re going to take care of our veterans,” Mr. Trump told a few thousand people at the Rolling Thunder rally for imprisoned or missing U.S. soldiers.      He promised to give veterans the option of seeing a private doctor if they encounter delays in getting care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. “Of those vets, of our cherished people, thousands of people are waiting on line to see a doctor,” Mr. Trump said. “That is not going to happen anymore. If there is a wait, we are going to give the right for those people to go to a private doctor, or even a public doctor, and get themselves taken care of and we are going to pay the bill.”               The campaign has said Mr. Trump would likely push VA health care toward privatization and might move for it to become more like Medicare rather than an integrated hospital system.      Mr. Trump also said that on Tuesday, he would hold a news conference to announce the recipients of $6 million he said he helped raise for veterans after skipping a GOP debate. Charities have previously said they are awaiting those funds, and Mr. Trump also faced protests in the past week about whether he made a promised $1 million donation from his own pocket.      Mr. Trump’s address was mostly his familiar stump speech, about how his administration would make the U.S. a stronger player on the international stage by spending less on protecting other countries and cutting trade deals to bring manufacturing jobs back into the country. He criticized Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and what he described as the “dishonest” press.     The crowd—both before and after his address—was generally enthusiastic about his campaign     “More power to him,” Jackie Everson of Wixom, Mich., said of Mr. Trump’s appearance at Rolling Thunder. She said his assertion last year that former prisoner of war Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) isn't a war hero made her cringe, but “nobody is going to be perfect [and] there is a lot to appreciate” about Mr. Trump.     Thousands more people had gathered hours before to watch motorcycles rumble around the national Mall as part of the annual Rolling Thunder event, and some of them didn’t leave their spots to watch Mr. Trump speak.     Mr. Trump seemed a bit disappointed with the turnout, which he said would have been larger if more people had been allowed to enter an area that had been fenced off around the Lincoln Memorial.     “I thought it would be like Dr. Martin Luther King, with people lined up from here all the way to the Washington Monument,” he said.
