ATHENS—Greece’s outspoken finance minister,         Yanis Varoufakis,    resigned on Monday under pressure from his government and his country’s creditors, who both identified him as an obstacle to productive talks about a new bailout deal. “I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants…for my…‘absence’ from its meetings; an idea that the prime minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement,” Mr. Varoufakis said.              Euclid Tsakalotos,    a 55-year-old Oxford-educated economist who has been heading the country’s negotiating team in talks with the country’s international creditors, was appointed to succeed Mr. Varoufakis as finance chief and was sworn in later Monday.               Mr. Tsipras placed Mr. Tsakalotos in charge of the country’s negotiating team in April, in a move that effectively sidelined Mr. Varoufakis from the day-to-day talks after his combative style alienated many European officials. Unlike the outgoing finance minister, who was a newcomer to Syriza, Mr. Tsakalotos has been elected three times as a member of Parliament with Syriza and is a member of the left-wing party’s powerful central committee.     Mr. Varoufakis, a charismatic 54-year-old economist known for his colorful rhetoric and vehement attacks on austerity, is one of the most popular figures in Greek public life. But his confrontational style angered and frustrated key European finance ministers including Germany’s         Wolfgang Schäuble,    who has reacted with particular ire in recent months to Mr. Varoufakis’s blunt criticism of Europe’s handling of the Greek crisis.

Mr. Varoufakis’s popularity in Greece had deterred Mr. Tsipras from ousting him until now, these people say. But the premier decided to act after Mr. Varoufakis told a U.K. newspaper late Sunday that Greece might introduce a parallel currency and electronic IOUs similar to those issued previously in California. Mr. Varoufakis quickly backtracked on his comments to the Daily Telegraph, but his prime minister had had enough, the people familiar with the matter say.      A parallel currency and IOUs would put Greece on a slippery slope to exit from the euro, economists and European officials say. It was the latest in a number of Mr. Varoufakis’s ideas that didn’t have the support of much of the rest of the Greek government.     News of Mr. Varoufakis’s departure helped the euro briefly pare losses against the dollar, raising expectations that Greece might find it easier to reach a deal with its creditors. Many European officials reacted with relief, with one French official on Monday describing Mr. Varoufakis’s provocative opinions as being “unacceptable.”          The resignation comes a day after 61% of Greek voters rejected creditors’ bailout terms in a referendum, triggering a wave of euphoria across the crisis-hit nation.      For Mr. Varoufakis, the blow may be softened by the adulation he continues to receive from Greeks for his determination to stand up to the German-led creditors.      “He is leaving as a hero, but it is clear that Tsipras did not want to share his moment of triumph,” said         Aimilios Avgouleas,    professor of banking law and finance at Edinburgh University. “He will probably take to the speakers’ circuit and then set up a political movement. But this will depend on whether Greece is ultimately successful in getting a bailout deal.”                                                 Yanis Varoufakis arrives to make a statement in Athens on Sunday.

Early on, he described the Eurogroup as “a committee built on rotten foundations.” He told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he was being treated by eurozone officials “as a strange bird because I talk macroeconomics….It’s astonishing to me that having a quasi-sophisticated discussion of economics is almost considered to be bad manners.”      Though the reshuffle of Greece’s negotiating team reduced his influence in bailout negotiations, he remained an influential adviser to Mr. Tsipras and a leading advocate of taking a hard line against creditors in the conviction that Germany and others would relent in their austerity demands rather than risk the breakup of the euro.     “I consider it my duty to help Alexis Tsipras exploit, as he sees fit, the capital that the Greek people granted us through yesterday’s referendum,” Mr. Varoufakis said on his blog on Monday. “And I shall wear the creditors’ loathing with pride.”                   “I consider it my duty to help Alexis Tsipras exploit, as he sees fit, the capital that the Greek people granted us through yesterday’s referendum. And I shall wear the creditors’ loathing with pride”                — Yanis Varoufakis             Mr. Varoufakis’s last task at the Finance Ministry was to announce that the government was seeking a new chief to run the country’s national statistics service, indicating that Greece’s current chief statistician,         Andreas Georgiou,    wouldn’t stay on.     Mr. Georgiou’s strict application of Eurostat’s standards to Greece’s public finances has angered some Greek politicians, who have accused him of inflating the budget deficit to help justify the country’s unpopular bailout. Mr. Georgiou, as well as European authorities, have rejected these allegations as being baseless. His term officially expires on Aug. 2.     Mr. Varoufakis lost no time in launching his plans. His publisher began plugging a new edition of Mr. Varoufakis’s book about international financial crises, “The Global Minotaur.”      Trained in mathematics and economics, Mr. Varoufakis spent his entire career before 2015 in academia, teaching at universities in Europe, Australia and, most recently, the U.S. He returned to Greece to run in the January elections, winning a seat in Parliament with massive voter support.      His abrasive views and personal style—including his motorcycle and often casual attire—has this year made him a global media celebrity and, for some, a sex symbol.
