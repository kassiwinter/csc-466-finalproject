                        	Getty Images                       	Kellyanne Conway, President-elect Trump’s campaign manager, is publicly discouraging her boss from naming Mitt Romney as secretary of state.
Conway, a top transition adviser to Trump, tweeted Thursday that she’s receiving a “deluge” of comments about Romney — and then linked to a Politico story about Trump loyalists opposing the former Massachusetts governor’s nomination.
“Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state,” Conway tweeted.
In a follow-up tweet, she suggested that loyalty was an important criteria for the top diplomatic post.
“Kissinger & Schultz as Secs of State flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist,” she said.
Conway’s public skepticism demonstatres the internal tug of war over the secretary of state’s slot. .
A Trump insider said Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Reince Priibus, the Republican National Committee chairman tapped to become the White House chief of staff, are pushing Romney.
But Trump senior counselor and strategist Stephen Bannon and Conway oppose Romney, a source familiar with the discussions said.
The other leading candidate is former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
During the campaign, Romney was an outspoken critic of Trump, describing him as a “con artist” who was temperamentally unfit to be president.
