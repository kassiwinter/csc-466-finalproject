WASHINGTON—Little more than a year after the last government shutdown, Congress scrambled to avoid another one on Thursday, after a push from House Republican leaders smacked into opposition from both sides of the aisle.In a day rocked by internal party warfare, lawmakers locked horns with their leaders and the White House over whether to support a $1.1 trillion spending bill negotiated by a bipartisan group funding most of the government through September 2015 and the Homeland Security Department through February. House GOP leaders had predicted the bill would pass, but were forced to delay a vote for hours, as it became clear that opposition from conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats could spell an embarrassing defeat on the House floor.     Meanwhile, in a rare clash with one of its closest allies, the White House backed the bill opposed by House Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) but embraced by top Senate Democrats.               The day’s mayhem joined President         Barack Obama,    House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader         Harry Reid    (D., Nev.) in supporting the same goal—passing a longer-term spending bill—in the face of opposition to different aspects of it from critics as varied as liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and conservative GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.     The White House dispatched Chief of Staff         Denis McDonough    to a Thursday evening meeting of congressional Democrats, aiming to shore up support for the bill. Mr. McDonough made a pitch for the longer-term bill, saying Democrats would end up with a worse deal if they supported a temporary patch, because Republicans would have more power to shape new, long-term legislation next year, according to lawmakers in the meeting.     Democrats applauded at the end of his presentation. But Mr. McDonough didn’t appear to have changed any minds—including that of Mrs. Pelosi. “The final product is one I believe most Democrats cannot support as it stands today,” Rep. Steve Israel (D., N.Y.) told reporters.        
More        If support for the longer-term spending bill comes up short, House Republicans were expected to pass a three-month extension of the government’s current funding instead. House GOP lawmakers and aides were locked in meetings late Thursday as GOP leaders deliberated which course to take.      A stopgap measure approved by the House was expected to pass later Thursday night in the Senate to avoid even a brief shutdown.     House GOP leaders intent on defusing their recent budget brinkmanship in Congress wrote a plan designed to push into next year the fight over Mr. Obama’s plans to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.     But conservatives rejected the approach as capitulation to the president, forcing GOP leaders to turn to Democrats to help pass the bill. Problems arose there when provisions in the 1,600-page bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and congressional leaders ignited a liberal backlash this week.      Democrats, including Mrs. Pelosi and Ms. Warren, expressed sharp concerns about provisions that would scale back language in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law and change campaign-finance rules.     The provision that drew the most Democratic criticism would scale back a provision in Dodd-Frank requiring banks to “push out” some of their riskiest derivatives-trading activities into affiliates ineligible for federal backstop programs such as deposit insurance. Banks have long sought the change, arguing that the provision actually increases risk by pushing swaps activity into less-regulated entities.     GOP leaders’ problems securing support for the bill gave Democrats an opening to press their demands to cut provisions they have objected to from the bill. “It is clear from this recess on the floor that the Republicans don’t have enough votes,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote to House Democrats Thursday afternoon. “This increases our leverage to get two offensive provisions of the bill removed: the bank bailout and big-money-for-campaigns provision.”     But Mrs. Pelosi’s stance was undercut when the White House backed the bill Thursday, calling it a bipartisan compromise. After that, Mrs. Pelosi, who hadn’t explicitly said she would vote against the bill earlier, took to the House floor Thursday to announce her opposition. “I’m enormously disappointed that the White House feels that the only way they can get a bill is to go along with this,” she said.     While Mr. Obama opposes parts of the bill, specifically the changes to Dodd-Frank and political contributions, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that overall it is a “compromise proposal” that “provides the kind of certainty that’s important to our economy.”     The distance between Mrs. Pelosi and the White House echoed a recent strain between the administration and Mr. Reid, displaying a new coolness between Democrats in Congress and the White House since the party’s defeats in last month’s midterm election. Late last month, the White House threatened to veto a deal on temporary tax breaks under negotiation between top Senate Democrats and House Republicans. That issue still hasn’t been resolved.     On the spending bill, the White House wasn’t poised to win over another traditional ally, Hispanic Democrats, some of whom oppose the bill because it only funds the Homeland Security Department through February.      Republicans “are having a tantrum because the president chose to take targeted actions that help the country by prioritizing the deportation of criminals and leaving American families alone,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.) said in a statement urging colleagues to vote no.                                                 House Speaker John Boehner had said he was confident the House would pass the spending bill, but then came a delay.          Associated Press                                                                                                             Other Democrats are also opposed to a provision in the bill that would raise contribution caps for national party committees—allowing individuals to give up to 10 times the current limit.     Meanwhile, Republicans also faced defections from conservatives who wanted their leaders to use the must-pass spending bill to try to block implementation of Mr. Obama’s immigration plan this year, before it takes effect.     In a rare act of defiance against GOP leadership, 16 Republicans voted against the bill on a procedural motion Thursday, nearly bringing down the measure. Rank-and-file lawmakers typically support their leadership in a rule vote even if they oppose the final bill.     “We’ve got to stop this amnesty program of the president. Unfortunately our leadership is supporting it,” said Rep. Paul Broun (R., Ga.), who voted against the rule.     Mr. Boehner said earlier Thursday the bill put Republicans in a better position to challenge the president’s immigration plan early next year, when the GOP will control both chambers of Congress. “We’ll take this fight to the president on the strongest possible ground with new majorities that the American people elected,” he said.     —Michael R.
