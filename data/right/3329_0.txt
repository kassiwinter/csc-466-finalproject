While Congress passed a massive $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill early Friday, President Trump threatened to veto it later in the morning, meaning a government shutdown is still a possibility.The president pointed to the legislation’s lack of full funding for his border wall between the United States and Mexico and that there are no protections for recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.“I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,” he wrote. I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018Earlier Friday Trump alluded to his frustration over these issues but did not mention it in relation to the spending bill. “DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall,” he wrote. DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018Many Republican lawmakers, unhappy with the fiscal burden the bill places on our nation, were pleased with the news, encouraging him to do so."Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible," Sen. Bob Corker tweeted. Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus.

Rand Paul wrote.
