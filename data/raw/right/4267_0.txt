      	President Trump spiked the football on his immigration agreement with Mexico and taunted his media critics with a tweetstorm that called the accord “a huge deal.”
“MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!” he blared in an all-caps post at 8:03 am.
“‘That’s going to be a huge deal because Mexico will be using their strong Immigration Laws – A game changer,’” Trump tweeted, quoting Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. “‘People no longer will be released into the U.S.,” the quote continued.
Under terms announced late Friday, Mexico agreed to keep Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. on its side of the border until their cases are decided. Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!

“Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!” Trump wrote.

“These ‘Fakers’ are Bad News!” Trump wrote.
