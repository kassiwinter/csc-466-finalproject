      	@Jack might want to update his password.
The personal account of Twitter’s chief executive Jack Dorsey was hacked Friday afternoon, which resulted in a barrage of bizarre and racist tweets from @jack — famous for sending out the first-ever tweet in March 2006.
At approximately 3:45 p.m., Dorsey’s account tweeted out “Shoutout Debut, Corey, NuBLoM, Joe, Owen, & Aqua,” apparently the names of a group of hackers calling themselves #ChucklingHella.
The account immediately went on to tweet out the N-word in all caps before adding: “intel is there’s a bomb at Twitter HQ.”
A Twitter account for “Aqua” tweeted: “If I Go Jail I’ll Still Be Chuckling.”
“We’re aware that @jack was compromised and investigating what happened,” Twitter’s press team wrote.
