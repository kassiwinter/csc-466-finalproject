 Mary Katharine Ham provides the details:
Compressed for your viewing ease, two hours and 45 minutes of news on CNN without a mention of a shooting at the advocacy group’s office 1.1 miles from the CNN D.C. bureau. This is the West Coast feed (I'm in the Los Angeles area), so that’s why the clock in the corner flashes both Eastern and Pacific times.
MSNBC and Fox were quicker and more aggressive with their coverage, putting it on TV and on their home pages within the time it took CNN to tweet the story as breaking news at 2:11 p.m. (The @CNNbrk feed is on PST, hence the 11:11 a.m. time stamp.) MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, however, completely ignored the story during his show.
Thanks to MKH for collaborating with me on this. As she noted in another post at HotAir:
