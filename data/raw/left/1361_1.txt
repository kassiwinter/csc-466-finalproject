On Sunday night, Texas Gov. Rick Perry tweeted this image out from his personal @governorperry Twitter account accompanied by the text "A2":A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized. I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down.
â€” Rick Perry (@GovernorPerry) September 1, 2014The woman in the picture above is Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney whom Perry tried to have removed from her job after a drunken-driving arrest in April 2013. Perry's threatened veto to funding for the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, which he made good on when Lehmberg did not resign, is at the center of the indictment of the governor late last month.Perry spokespeople did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking explanation for just what happened with that first tweet.
