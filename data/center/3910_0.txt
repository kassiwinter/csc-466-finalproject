                                          By Avery Anapol - 12/10/18 11:57 AM EST                                                        Far-right activist Gavin McInnes has been kicked off YouTube, the latest social media platform to cut ties with him or his group, the Proud Boys.The Daily Beast reported Monday that YouTube has banned McGinnes, who had more than 220,000 subscribers before the ban.A statement on McInnes's YouTube page says that the channel has been terminated after “multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement.”"When a copyright holder notifies us of a video that infringes on their copyright, we act quickly to remove content as is required of us by law," a YouTube spokesperson told The Hill. "We terminate the accounts of repeat offenders."McInnes, who has been described as a far-right provocateur, has also been kicked off Amazon, PayPal, Twitter and Facebook.Last week, BlazeTV cut ties with McInnes, who joined the network just a week earlier to host the show “Get Off My Lawn.”The Proud Boys call themselves "a pro-Western fraternal organization for men who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world; aka Western Chauvinists." They are considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Several members of the Proud Boys were arrested last month for alleged roles in a street brawl in New York in October.McInnes has since disavowed the group, but said that it is not a white nationalist or alt-right organization. McInnes was denied a visa to tour Australia after he was found to be of “bad character.”                                                    The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are © 1998 - 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
