Exempt from the decision, however, are two top prosecutors overseeing politically sensitive inquiries, including Delaware U.S. attorney David Weiss, whose office is conducting a criminal tax investigation into President Biden’s son, Hunter, a senior Justice Department official said.      Another prosecutor,         John Durham,    is expected to remain as a special counsel overseeing a wide-ranging inquiry into the origins of the FBI’s 2016 Russia investigation, while relinquishing his position as Connecticut’s U.S. attorney, the official said. Former Attorney General William Barr named him special counsel in October. He announced the decision in December.     The Justice Department official said the resignation request applies to 56 U.S. attorneys, but their departures aren’t expected to be immediate. Justice Department officials have scheduled a Tuesday conference call with U.S. attorneys to discuss the transition, two officials said.               It is not clear whether the request also applies to Michael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, who has been overseeing the sprawling prosecutions stemming from the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.     The move also comes as Mr. Biden’s nominee for attorney general, federal circuit Judge Merrick Garland, awaits his yet-to-be-set confirmation hearing.     The planned action was earlier reported by CNN.     It is fairly customary for new administrations to ask for holdover officials to step down so that a new president can install his own selections. The president appoints, and the Senate confirms, 93 U.S. attorneys to serve as the top prosecutor in each judicial district in the U.S. The offices operate somewhat autonomously but take direction from Justice Department headquarters on priorities.     Many of the top prosecutors nominated by Mr. Trump have already left their positions.     Mr. Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, made waves in 2017 when he asked 46 remaining U.S. attorneys appointed by former President         Barack Obama    to submit their resignations immediately. That move sparked confusion, as Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, said Mr. Trump had asked him to remain in his job. Mr. Bharara was ultimately fired.     While Mr. Obama’s administration let U.S. attorneys appointed by President         George W. Bush    remain in their jobs until successors were confirmed, President         Bill Clinton’s    attorney general Janet Reno asked U.S. attorneys to submit their resignations.     —Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.
