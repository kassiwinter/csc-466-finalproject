Early- and absentee-voting data suggests         Hillary Clinton    may be benefiting from an uptick in Hispanic voters even as turnout among African-Americans appears to be lagging compared with 2008 and 2012.      Donald Trump,        meanwhile, isn’t seeing a significant turnout boost powered by white voters, though Republicans are seeing positive signs in several Midwestern states. At least 37 million early votes had been cast as of Friday, with at least one million more Democrats than Republicans having returned ballots in the data released so far. The practice has exploded in popularity in recent years: Texas, Georgia, Indiana and Oregon are reporting that a record number of early ballots have been cast, according to the Associated Press. And in Maryland, Minnesota and Tennessee and other states, early turnout has already surpassed 2012 levels.     Votes that are cast early are secret and often not counted until Election Day, but many states release party registration information of the voters who have requested and returned absentee ballots or have voted in-person. That means the early-voting numbers don’t take into account the behavior of independent voters, nor can they account for voters who are registered with one party but cast ballots for the candidate of another party.

Still, early-vote figures can provide some clues into the composition of the voting population, the enthusiasm for a candidate and organizational ability of a political campaign in turning out its supporters.                                         In Florida, Democrats put a lot of effort into getting out the vote. But some in the Trump camp question whether a ground game matters in an era of such high-profile candidates. WSJ looks at the differing strategies in this key swing state.

New WSJ/NBC News/Marist polls fill in more of the gaps in the election picture. WSJ national politics editor Aaron Zitner explains.

Modeling by the data firm Catalist, which works with Democratic campaigns, shows that Latino early turnout surged to 13% of the electorate as of Tuesday, up from about 11% at the same point in 2012 and about 8% at the same point in 2008.               The Clinton campaign is also optimistic about steady Hispanic early-voting participation in Colorado and Nevada. In Nevada, 7.6% of all early ballots mailed in or cast in person have been by Hispanic or Latino voters, according to Catalist. What isn’t clear in those states is whether the Clinton campaign has attracted new Hispanic supporters or whether it has simply convinced more Hispanics to cast their ballots early rather than on Election Day.     At the same time, there are signs that black turnout may be down slightly in Florida, North Carolina and Georgia—a cause for concern among many Clinton supporters that many voters from a key part of the coalition that twice elected President         Barack Obama    may stay home on Election Day.     Black early vote turnout is down 7% in both Florida and North Carolina compared with the same point in 2012. The Clinton campaign never expected to match or exceed Mr. Obama’s turnout among black voters who were intensively supportive of him.     Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said that rules in some states, notably North Carolina, have changed since 2012 and limited early voting options for many of the campaign’s supporters.     Cutting back the number of early-voting sites “harmed our ability to be as effective as we could be in getting African-American early vote in,” Ms. Palmieri said, adding that boosting black turnout in the final days “is a big priority.”      For Mr. Trump, there is little sign that the GOP presidential nominee is living up to his promise to turn out vast numbers of new white voters who previously didn’t participate in presidential elections. But the Trump campaign is seeing positive signs in the early voting data from several states in the Midwest.     In the battleground state of Ohio, for example, many Republican-leaning counties have been either overperforming or staying steady with their 2012 numbers. In two key Democratic-leaning counties, Franklin and Cuyahoga, overall early vote appears to have been lagging—though some data suggests that Democrats appear to be making up ground in the final days before the election. By contrast, in three Republican-leaning counties, early ballots appear to be up. Marion County, which was carried by Republican         Mitt Romney    in 2012, ballot returns are up 25%, while in Warren County, the early vote is up 15%.        
Data Comes From Several SourcesEarly and absentee voting has exploded in popularity in recent years, as Election Day has shifted from a single day in November to a weeks-long and sometimes months-long period where voters can choose from many options to cast their ballots including by mail, at early voting sites or at Election Day polling places. This analysis of early voting data was compiled by multiple sources. First, the nonpartisan U.S. Election Project in partnership with the Associated Press aggregates all the early voting data from across the country as released by some states and local governments. The data firm Catalist, which works with Democratic campaigns, provided comparative data for three western states. Finally, the Republican National Committee and Clinton campaign have been highlighting their strengths in early and absentee voting numbers by state.        In Iowa, early votes received from Democrats are down by about 24,000 compared with 2012. The ballots already cast by Republicans in the state are slightly down as well, about 3,000 compared with 2012 as well. The 2012 and 2016 numbers were reported as of the Thursday before Election Day.     Both parties are now in the midst of a massive turnout effort to cajole their supporters to the polls. Mrs. Clinton’s travel schedule has been almost entirely focused around motivating supporters in states with early vote.     As Election Day nears, the campaign is focusing on states that have limited absentee voting and no early in-person voting, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Mr. Obama will visit New Hampshire for a rally on Monday, while Mrs. Clinton is visiting Michigan and Pennsylvania on Friday.     Mr. Trump’s campaign has expressed confidence about the early-voting turnout operation the Republican National Committee has put together.     “The RNC ground game has also done an incredible job of contacting voters and getting them to the polls early to vote for Donald Trump,” said Trump campaign manager         David Bossie    last week. “We know that early voting can help us compete right from the outset.”     —Dante Chinni contributed to this article.
