                                                                                                                                         President Obama is using the national debate over gun violence to  push for further action on his health care law, including insisting on  the kind of mental health coverage states must provide under their  Medicaid programs.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Obama, unveiling his gun proposals Wednesday barely a month after   the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., will make it clear that  his health law, known as the Affordable Care Act, allows doctors to ask  patients whether they have guns in their homes, and will tell them  they are able to report any threats of violence they hear to police.                                                                                                                                                      The president also will lay out the mental health coverage that all   insurers will be required to provide under his signature-achievement   law.                                                                                                                                                                    Those are some of the 23 executive actions Mr. Obama plans to take  whether or not Congress acts on his broader recommendations, the White  House said.                                                                                                                              Other moves including offering incentives for schools to hire police;   finally naming a new director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,   Firearms and Explosives (ATF); and requiring federal authorities to trace   all guns recovered in their criminal investigations.                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. Obama also will call on his secretaries of education and health  and human services to hold a national dialogue on mental health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The entire list of the actions Mr. Obama is taking comprises:                                                                                                                              1.
