But Congress expressly rejected that argument," ACLU court documents stated.The ACLU concluded that the administration was addressing "the wrong branch of government" with its request."It should make its case to Congress rather than seeking emergency intervention from this court regarding an almost 40-year-old statute."What did the lower courts say?Though the administration's ban was described as temporary, the lower courts ruled that it was not up to the White House to change existing federal laws in this way.Under US law, there is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants if they say they fear violence in their home countries - regardless of how they have entered the country.US District Judge Jon Tigar in California had first blocked Mr Trump's proclamation in November, and extended his order this month.A panel of appeals court judges upheld that injunction. Conservative Judge Jay Bybee wrote in the appeals opinion: "Just as we may not, as we are often reminded, 'legislate from the bench,' neither may the Executive legislate from the Oval Office", the Washington Post reported.Media caption, Trump and the facts about the migrant caravanWhat is the situation at the border?The latest group of migrants seeking entry into the US come from across Central America. They travelled north for weeks in what Mr Trump described as a "caravan of people".They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.In the run-up to the US mid-term elections, President Trump said most were criminals, called the caravan an invasion, and ordered troops to the border. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that any migrants who illegally enter the US - including asylum seekers - will have to wait in Mexico for their cases to be heard.The Mexican government has said it will offer migrants work visas and protections while they await asylum proceedings, according to the US Department of State.More on this story
