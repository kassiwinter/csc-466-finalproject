An accountant for         Paul Manafort    told jurors Friday she believed his tax returns contained inaccurate information and falsely reduced his tax liability by classifying millions of dollars she believed was income as loans.The accountant,         Cindy Laporta,    said manipulating tax returns in such a way was “inappropriate” and that she knew it was wrong, but did it because Mr. Manafort was a longtime client of her firm. “I prepared the tax returns and communicated with banks based on information that [Richard] Gates and Mr. Manafort provided to me that I didn’t believe,” said Ms. LaPorta, who testified under immunity. Ms. Laporta, who worked for Mr. Manafort’s longtime accounting firm, KWC, was the first of five immunized witnesses scheduled to take the stand in the trial of the former         Trump    campaign chairman on charges that he lied on his taxes, didn’t disclose holding overseas bank accounts, and participated in bank fraud.      Mr. Manafort, a political consultant, has pleaded not guilty and rejected all the charges. His lawyers argue that special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    office, which brought the prosecution, is exceeding its authority.               The testimony came on the fourth day of a trial that is moving faster than lawyers on both sides expected, with prosecutors using multiple witnesses so far to lay out a case that Mr. Manafort kept secretive overseas bank accounts to avoid taxes. Prosecutors expect to wrap up their case next week, including testimony from Mr. Gates, Mr. Manafort’s longtime associate. And then Mr. Manafort’s defense will take over.                                         Paul Manafort’s first of two trials is underway, and he’s facing 18 counts related to bank and tax fraud.

On Friday, Ms. Laporta recalled a 2015 conference call with Mr. Gates, who worked in Mr. Manafort’s consulting firm, in which they discussed Mr. Manafort’s firm’s tax bill the day before it was due. “Rick said it was too high, and he didn’t have that money,” Ms. Laporta testified, adding that “he” referred to Mr. Manafort.     Ms. Laporta said she agreed to help finesse the company’s income, recasting $900,000 as a loan, based on a two-page loan agreement that appeared to be from one of Mr. Manafort’s clients, Telmar, that she suspected was fake.     The change allowed Mr. Manafort’s company to save around $400,000 to $500,000 in the taxes for 2014, Ms. Laporta said.      “Do you regret?” prosecutor Uzo Asonye asked. “I very much regret it,” Ms. Laporta said.      She later described an elaborate plan that included another $1 million in suspicious loans from Telmar that Mr. Manafort’s company booked for 2015. Then, in late 2015 and 2016, Ms. Laporta said Mr. Manafort told her he was applying for mortgage loans from two U.S. financial institutions, and asked her to provide documents to those banks. Messrs. Manafort and Gates pressed her to send to the banks what she believed were false documents purportedly forgiving the previously booked loans, after the banks had asked to see more income to provide the mortgages.     Ms. Laporta’s testimony wasn’t the first time prosecutors have suggested Mr. Manafort disguised income as a loan.     They previously introduced documents and testimony from another accountant and bookkeeper that Mr. Manafort’s company listed a loan of $1.5 million from a company called Peranova on its ledger and 2012 tax returns. In fact, Mr. Manafort controlled Peranova, a Cyprus-based shell company, and the money was income he earned for work overseas, prosecutors say.     Ms. Laporta’s account followed testimony earlier Friday from         Philip Ayliff,    another accountant who helped prepare Mr. Manafort, who said he didn’t know Mr. Manafort controlled foreign bank accounts that prosecutors allege were used to disguise millions of dollars in income.     Mr. Ayliff helped produce Mr. Manafort’s business and personal tax returns from 2010 through 2014. He said Mr. Manafort repeatedly denied controlling foreign bank accounts during that time.     Prosecutors say that in addition to hiding foreign bank accounts and mischaracterizing income, Mr. Manafort falsely described rental properties as a residence, another way to get a tax advantage.     Mr. Ayliff testified that Mr. Manafort asked him to tell a bank that a Manhattan condominium he owned was for personal use and not a rental property, when it had been listed as a rental on previous tax returns. Mr. Ayliff said he refused.     Before the accountants spoke, a series of vendors told jurors earlier this past week that Mr. Manafort had paid them tens of thousands of dollars for suits, entertainment systems, landscaping and other high-end services by using wire transfers from overseas banks, most of them in Cyprus.     In a separate hearing in Washington, D.C., Friday, a federal judge heard arguments that Mr. Mueller’s appointment was unconstitutional and not authorized by any statute.     That challenge stemmed from a case Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors brought earlier this year against several Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens, accusing them of unlawfully using fake social media posts, false personas and staged rallies to sow discord in the U.S. and influence the 2016 election.     One of the companies, Concord Management & Consulting LLC, is arguing that Mr. Mueller’s appointment violates the Constitution, which empowers the president to make executive branch appointments, and that the Justice Department regulations governing his appointment are unlawful.      A judge earlier this week rejected similar assertions by a potential witness in Mr. Mueller’s investigation.
