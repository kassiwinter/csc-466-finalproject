#2MillionBikerstoDC should be trending. Despite being denied riding permits by D.C. city officials, motorcyclists from across the nation honored 9/11 victims and the U.S. Armed Forces Wednesday by rumbling more than 900,000 strong through the Capitol. The bikers reportedly wore name tags of the fallen. The military also showed their support in favor of the patriotic ride. Marine salutes bikers in greeting! Got pic from #2MBikers Facebook page!

Facebook pages for the two events might have given Americans a bit of foresight into the turnout of this event. The MAMAF page had 291 "Likes" as of 2:40 p.m. on Wednesday, while the 2 Millions Bikers to DC is currently at 201,000 and growing. We can all rest assured knowing at least America still knows where its allegiance lies.
