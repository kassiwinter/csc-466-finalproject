                 | July 19, 2019 02:15 PM                 | Updated Jul 19, 2019, 04:13 PM                 Amid heightened tension in the region, a British oil tanker was reportedly seized by Iran.       Iran's Revolutionary Guards claim that they seized a British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, on Friday. The ship's owners said in a statement that it had been “approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the Strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters.”             The 30,000-ton ship bound for Saudi Arabia abruptly veered off course and into Iranian waters according to tracking data.       The British government said it was assessing the situation following the reports. The Ministry of Defense emphasized that it had ships in the area, but hasn't provided further details on exactly what happened.       The news comes a day after the U.S. says it “destroyed” an Iranian drone. Tensions in the Middle East have continued to escalate in recent weeks. Last month, the U.S. planned airstrikes against Iranian facilities in response to the downing of a U.S. drone, but Trump reportedly called off the attack in the last minutes, citing possible loss of life.                                         UK Defence Ministry: “We are urgently seeking further information and assessing the situation following reports of an incident in the Gulf.” https://t.co/tQ3ngAj7ZL— NBC News (@NBCNews) July 19, 2019                              An emergency meeting is reportedly underway in the UK over the international incident.

Oil prices rose sharply after news of the seizure and stocks began to dip in reaction to the incident.             President Trump addressed the seizure briefly to reporters. He touted the "close alliance" the two countries share and said the U.S. would be talking to the United Kingdom about the incident.       "This only goes to show what I'm saying about Iran. Trouble. Nothing but trouble," he said. "It goes to show you I was right about Iran."       He added that the "U.S. has very few tankers going in because we’re using a lot of our own energy."
