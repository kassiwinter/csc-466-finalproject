Sen.         Bernie Sanders,    an independent from Vermont, launched his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday, presenting competition from the political left to front-runner         Hillary Clinton.    “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Sanders will email supporters early Thursday, according to a preview offered by his campaign. “It’s about a grass-roots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’” On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders declared his candidacy to the Associated Press. “People should not underestimate me,” Mr. Sanders told the AP. “I’ve run outside of the two-party system, defeating Democrats and Republicans, taking on big-money candidates and, you know, I think the message that has resonated in Vermont is a message that can resonate all over this country.”

Mr. Sanders is expected to hold a kickoff event at the end of May in Burlington, Vt.     Mr. Sanders, a senator since 2007 and a senior member on the Senate Budget Committee, will join Mrs. Clinton as a formal candidate for the Democratic nomination.     As one of the Senate’s foremost liberals, Mr. Sanders could become the favored candidate of Democrats who hoped Massachusetts Sen.         Elizabeth Warren    would enter the race. He has pledged to take on big banks and focus on income inequality and the growing concentration of wealth.          A day before launching his campaign, Mr. Sanders took to Twitter to demand presidential candidates answer three questions: “Is it morally appropriate that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%? Is it good economics that the top one-tenth of 1% own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%? Is our democracy being destroyed when one family can spend $900 million to buy elections?”                                         Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is expected to announce he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination.

The former secretary of state has also promised to make income inequality a focus of her campaign, but some in her party are skeptical, given her long-standing ties to Wall Street and large corporations.      In December, Mr. Sanders released a 12-point economic agenda in which he pledged to push for a minimum-wage increase, more-affordable higher education, a “major investment” in infrastructure and rules to help workers more easily form labor unions. Mr. Sanders, who opposes expedited congressional review of the 12-nation Pacific trade deal now under negotiation, also called for a changed course on trade policy.     He also called for the break up of big financial institutions.      “The greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of major Wall Street firms plunged this country into the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. They are too powerful to be reformed,” he wrote in his policy document.          His comments were similar to those from Ms. Warren, who has made Wall Street her primary rhetorical target as senator.     It isn’t clear whether Mr. Sanders, a longtime independent, will join the Democratic Party. The Democratic National Committee requires a candidate seeking the party nomination to be a “bona fide Democrat,” but the document that outlines the party’s convention rules doesn’t define the term.     The senator has traveled recently to states that hold the earliest presidential nominating contests, among them South Carolina and Iowa.     Mr. Sanders faces a significant challenge to capturing the Democratic Party’s nomination. A Real Clear Politics average of recent polls found the senator with 5.6% support among Democratic primary voters—compared with 62.2% for Mrs. Clinton and 12.7% for Ms. Warren, who has said she isn’t running.      As a senator from a state with a population of around 650,000, Mr. Sanders is also relatively unknown. A 73-year-old Brooklyn, N.Y., native with the accent to prove it, Mr. Sanders may also not fare quite as well on stage as the more well-groomed Mrs. Clinton or the fresh-faced         Martin O’Malley,    the former governor of Maryland who is considering a presidential bid.     Mr. Sanders has acknowledged the difficulty his left-wing candidacy would face raising sufficient cash to compete for the presidency.     “When you think about undertaking a national presidential campaign, you have to be talking about sums of money which are almost incomprehensible,” he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview in February. “The first question is: Can you raise enough money to run a winning campaign? I’m trying to figure that one out.”     “Billionaires,” he added, “do not flock to my campaign.”     It is unclear how much money Mr. Sanders expects to raise, or what he thinks he needs to run a credible race. Mr. Sanders raised about $7 million for his last re-election in Vermont. Sums needed to run nationally are far larger.     A super PAC called Draft Bernie, which is backing Mr. Sanders’s presidential bid, had raised just $7,000 by the end of 2014. At that point, a super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton had raised $9 million.     The set of Democrats who have hoped Mrs. Clinton would have to compete for the nomination will welcome Mr. Sanders’s entry to the race. Party leaders in key states have said in recent months that they were troubled by the prospect of Mrs. Clinton gliding to the nomination without a serious challenge or even a debate, and voters in the party’s more liberal wing have said they are eager for an alternative to Mrs. Clinton.      So far, the senator has been reluctant to criticize Mrs. Clinton, who is widely seen as the front-runner for the nomination. He has declined to comment on a number of issues her campaign has faced in recent weeks, including questions over her use of a private email server and her foundation’s acceptance of foreign donations. Mr. O’Malley, meanwhile, has begun to voice some criticism of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign after remaining tight-lipped for months.
