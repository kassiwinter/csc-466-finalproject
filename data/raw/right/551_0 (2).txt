  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats in a letter Sunday night to fellow Democrats that the $1 trillion infrastructure bill will be voted on Thursday after doing her best Joe Namath imitation by guaranteeing that the bill will be passed.

"Let’s get this done and deliver for the people."Asked on ABC if she agrees the final number on the so-called reconciliation bill will be "somewhat smaller" than $3.5 trillion, Pelosi responded: "That seems self-evident."Jayapal said if someone wants to take something out of the reconciliation package, "we need to hear what it is."GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREPelosi has not set a date to bring the $3.5 trillion social welfare and climate bill, Reuters reported.John Podesta, the former counselor to Barack Obama, told Politico that it could be "disastrous" if Democrats in the 2022 midterms.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS"If you pull out the fact that when Democrats were in control they couldn’t do anything for you, then drawing attention to how wacky the Republicans have become doesn’t mean a lot."The Associated Press contributed to this report
