Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019 The latest allegation against Kavanaugh came from nonprofit owner Max Stier and had not previously been made public. It was reported to the FBI during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation process last year but was not investigated.Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed by a 50-48 margin in the Senate after multiple sexual misconduct allegations were made against him.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all previous allegations against him, and he declined to answer questions about the new allegations to the Times on Saturday.Several prominent Democrats, including some 2020 presidential candidates, have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment from the Supreme Court in light of the new allegation.Trump rushed to Kavanaugh's defense over the weekend, before the correction was issued, tweeting Sunday that “Radical left Democrats” and the "LameStream Media" want to scare Kavanaugh into "turning Liberal.""Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment," he tweeted. "He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him."
