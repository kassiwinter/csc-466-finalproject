                 | October 02, 2020 10:34 AM                 | Updated Oct 02, 2020, 01:57 PM                 Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, has tested negative for COVID-19.       White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere told the Washington Examiner on Friday morning that Barrett, who has recently been making the rounds on Capitol Hill and meeting with senators, is coronavirus-free.             “Judge Barrett was with the president last on Saturday when she was nominated. Judge Barrett is tested daily for COVID-19 — she has tested negative,” Deere, who is also a special assistant to the president, said.       “She is following CDC guidance and best practices, including social distancing, wearing face coverings, and frequently washes hands,” he added.       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who come into close contact with a person with the coronavirus should quarantine for 14 days.       Barrett tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this summer and has previously recovered from the illness, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing three officials familiar with her diagnosis.

The Kentucky Republican said that the Senate “can move forward” with Barrett’s confirmation, which many Republicans hope will come before the Nov. 3 election.       “Our biggest enemy, obviously, is what we were talking about at the beginning of the show, the coronavirus — keeping everyone healthy and well and in place to do our jobs,” he said during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt.       Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the confirmation process for Barrett is "on track," and hearings are still set to begin on Oct. 12.       Democrats have opposed Barrett's nomination, arguing that the push to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death should wait until after the 2020 election process is completed.       Trump has reportedly been experiencing mild cold-like symptoms after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.
