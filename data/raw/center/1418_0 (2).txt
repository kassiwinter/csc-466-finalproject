WASHINGTON—The nation’s unemployment rate slipped below 6% for the first time since the recession as hiring returned to a strong pace, lifting hopes for an economy that continues to show sluggish wage growth and persistent underemployment.Employers added 248,000 jobs in September, rebounding from a weak August, the Labor Department said Friday. Payrolls have expanded an average 227,000 a month this year, putting 2014 on track to be the strongest year of job growth since the late 1990s.                                         September's employment report released on Friday shows the jobless rate dipped to 5.9%. WSJ's Justin Lahart and Sudeep Reddy join the News Hub for a full analysis of the data.

Unemployment, nearly five years after surging to 10% in the wake of the recession, is moving closer to the 5.2%-5.5% range the Federal Reserve expects to see in the long run.     “I think we’ve finally reached that promised land of a self-sustaining, self-reinforcing economic recovery,” said         Stuart Hoffman,    chief economist at         PNC Financial Services Group.                   The robust jobs number, along with news of the unemployment rate falling below 6%, propelled stocks higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 208.64 points, or 1.2%, to 17009.69, ending four days of declines. The dollar soared against major currencies.

The upbeat report was tempered by weak earnings growth and continued high underemployment, reflecting workers stuck in part-time jobs.      But it still heightened prospects the Fed would move sooner than expected—perhaps in early 2015—to raise short-term interest rates. Central-bank policy makers, set to meet again in late October, have kept the Fed’s rate target near zero since the recession to fuel the recovery. Fed Chairwoman         Janet Yellen    has said the bank could move up its timetable for raising rates if growth continues to exceed expectations.     Friday’s report offers the last major snapshot of the jobs market before November’s midterm elections, locking in a political dynamic in which a relatively slow jobs recovery has given little uplift to President         Barack Obama    and his party. Mr. Obama, in two speeches this week, seized on labor-market progress as evidence the economy is picking up on Democrats’ watch. Republicans have countered by pointing to flat incomes and a shrinking share of workers in the labor force.          Indeed, Friday’s report highlighted underlying ills that threaten the economy’s long-term potential to grow and lift Americans’ living standards.     The labor-force participation rate—reflecting the share of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one—fell last month to a three-decade low of 62.7%. Before the recession it stood at 66%. Only part of the decline is due to aging baby boomers; even among Americans in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, participation is historically low.           More on Jobs Report           And workers’ wages still have yet to climb significantly. Among private-sector workers, average hourly earnings actually fell a penny last month, to $24.53. They have risen 2% over the past year. This is the second expansion in a row including the recovery after the 2001 recession, where economic growth hasn’t translated into rising incomes for most Americans.     While the economy is in the middle of a pickup, weak productivity growth and the downsized labor force point to limited gains in overall growth in the long term, said Morgan Stanley economist         Ted Wieseman.    “It’s just a dismal picture,” he said.     Tony Ozelis illustrates the mixed environment.     When Mr. Ozelis, 58 years old, was laid off from a corporate job this summer, he needed only two months to find another position. He is now real-estate manager for Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc., finding properties for new franchise owners for the Florida-based chain.                Unemployment: A Historical View                                                                                                                 But his salary, in the low six figures, is the same as he was making in 2008, before he was laid off from a national convenience-store chain and spent three years unemployed.     Mr. Ozelis, of Medford, N.Y., attributes his lack of progress to the still-sluggish economy that has given employers leverage. “Companies are really getting bargains out of the majority of their employees,” said Mr. Ozelis.     Some economic developments point to a potential shift ahead. Increased hiring this year has accompanied a pickup in spending by firms on facilities and big-ticket equipment. Economists say such moves show companies are becoming more bullish and are ready to expand over the long term. An increase in job openings coupled with lower unemployment could force firms to raise wages as they compete for a smaller share of workers.

The company’s growth partly reflects constrained consumers. The chain has embarked on a strategy of catering to Americans who are scrimping, including offering a $1.99 sandwich. Same-store sales have risen just under 3% this year, said         Jennifer Durham,    vice president of franchise development.     “Consumers aren’t any better off, quite frankly, than they were several years ago,” she said.                                                                                                                                But the company has seen increasing interest from people looking to open franchises, as the economy picks up and banks loosen credit conditions, allowing them to borrow money to open outlets. “Now you’re starting to feel the confidence in order to add another restaurant and you’re able to get the lending,” she said.     Last month’s job growth was broad-based, with professional and businesses services such as accounting and engineering leading the way, followed by construction, retail and health care. Manufacturing was largely flat for the second straight month.     The average workweek climbed to 34.6 hours—the highest since the recession and a sign companies may need to step up hiring to meet stronger demand.

A broader unemployment measure including part-time workers who can’t find full-time jobs and those too discouraged to apply for work stood at 11.8% in September.     Beverly Mastroianni is one of them. The Pittsburgh resident, 60, was laid off in February from her job as a leasing agent for a property manager. She estimates she has applied to more than 1,600 jobs, but has landed only two interviews. Ms. Mastroianni recently cut off previous jobs from her résumé so she would appear younger, for fear of being stigmatized for her age.“I’ve applied for everything, basically, and I can’t find work anywhere,” she said.     Ms. Mastroianni, whose unemployment benefits ran out last month, said she now plans to retire early at 62 to collect Social Security—joining the millions who have fallen out of the labor force since the recession.
