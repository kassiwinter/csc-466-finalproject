Rivals warn that strong showings in California and Texas next week could propel him to an insurmountable delegate lead.Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg kicked off the attacks against Sanders on Tuesday night, warning in the opening minutes of the debate that Russia wants Sanders to be the nominee because he’ll lose to President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves.

Scott Brown (R-Mass.).Warren returned to the issue of nondisclosure agreements, alleging that Bloomberg oversaw a toxic workplace for women and demanding that he release them from the nondisclosure agreements they’d signed.And she hammered Bloomberg for not having released his tax returns, likening him to Trump.“I don’t care how much money he has, the core of the Democratic Party will never trust him,” Warren said. “He’s the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.”Bloomberg was not blindsided this time around, as he was in Las Vegas. He disputed allegations that he supported the practice of redlining and denied that he ever told a woman who worked for him to "kill it" when he found out she was pregnant.But Warren’s attacks are landing, and it’s notable that she’s going hardest after Bloomberg, rather than Sanders, who stands in her way for the nomination.Candidates are battling to win over black votersThe Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina is more than half African American, testing the candidates’ abilities to reach a diverse coalition of voters who represent the backbone of the Democratic Party.Biden has been working to ward off a challenge from Sanders, who has been gaining in the polls among black voters and hopes to slam the doors shut on Biden’s campaign in South Carolina.But Biden had his strongest debate performance yet and has reason to feel good heading into Election Day in the Palmetto State on Saturday.The former vice president repeatedly touted his work under President Obama, the nation’s first black president. Biden also name-dropped Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), one of the state’s most powerful black leaders, who is expected to endorse Biden on Wednesday.Sanders, meanwhile, hammered home the idea that the U.S. must overhaul its drug laws and criminal justice system.Businessman Tom SteyerTom SteyerYouth voting organization launches M registration effort in key battlegrounds Overnight Energy: 'Eye of fire,' Exxon lobbyist's comments fuel renewed attacks on oil industry | Celebrities push Biden to oppose controversial Minnesota pipeline | More than 75 companies ask Congress to pass clean electricity standard Celebrities push Biden to oppose controversial Minnesota pipeline MORE has also drawn support from black voters in South Carolina, recent polls have shown, and his support margin among that group will be a key focus depending on how Biden finishes.The rest of the candidates on Tuesday night repeatedly returned to issues that are important to black voters, but it’s far past the deadline for candidates to have put in the hard work that earns the support of black voters at the ballot box.Candidates frantically searching for attention, votes before Super TuesdayWith the South Carolina primary on Saturday and Super Tuesday only 72 hours later, it’s desperation time.It’s possible that this was the last debate for one or more of the seven remaining candidates on stage, and that desperation showed over the course of the unruly, two-hour debate in Charleston.Long stretches of time were eaten up as the candidates shouted over one another.The CBS moderators completely lost control at points during the debate, which became a free-for-all benefitting whichever candidate outlasted or shouted loud enough over his or her rivals.That led to some frustration among centrist Democrats and progressives alike, who feel their candidates didn’t get a fair shake.Debate will raise fears about negativity among the candidatesThe Las Vegas debate last week was an all-out war. The Charleston debate may have matched it for its level of negativity.The candidates are not just fighting to win — there is clear animosity and bad blood between some of them.Klobuchar appears to truly dislike Buttigieg. Warren’s attacks on Bloomberg are blunt and cutting. Progressives will squirm watching Sanders and Warren criticize one another. Centrist Democrats will again throw their hands up, wondering why the moderate candidates continue to tear each other down instead of focusing solely on Sanders.“If we spend the next few months tearing our party apart, we’ll spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear this country apart,” Klobuchar warned Tuesday.There will be plenty of time for Democrats to unite. But fears of a divided and bitter base could persist for a while after a brutal nominating process.
