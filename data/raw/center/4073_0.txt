Mr Harris, a Baptist pastor, recalled Mr Dowless telling him: "I don't care if it's a 95-year-old woman in a wheelchair, we do not take the ballots."Image source, The Washington Post via Getty ImagesImage caption, Leslie McCrae Dowless is at the centre of the ballot-tampering controversyThe Republican candidate also referred to dramatic testimony a day earlier by his son, which left both men in tears.Mr Harris told the court his son was "a little judgmental and has a little taste of arrogance and some other things", but that he was "very proud of him".On Wednesday, John Harris told the elections board he had repeatedly warned his father about the "shady" tactics of Mr Dowless."I thought what he was doing was illegal, and I was right," John Harris testified, weeping, as his father also began to cry."I had no reason to believe that my father actually knew," the son added. Mr Dowless has refused to testify. But his former workers have testified that Mr Dowless instructed them to "pre-fill" ballot request forms, get them signed by voters, then mail in the absentee ballots.Bladen County, where Mr Dowless operated, was the only county for which Mr Harris won the mail-in absentee ballot vote.Prosecutors are reportedly considering whether to bring criminal charges against Mr Dowless, the New York Times reported.More on this story
