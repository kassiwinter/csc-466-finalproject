                                                                                                                                         The Obama administration is optimistic that Iran’s new leadership    could offer an opportunity to repair diplomatic relations with the United States and to permanently halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions.                                                                                                                                                      But former Vice President Dick Cheney believes that, eventually, America may have to resort to military force.                                                                                                                                                      In   an interview on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Mr. Cheney was asked whether a   strike on Iran is “inevitable.”                                                                                                                                                                    “I have trouble seeing how we’re going  to achieve our objective  short  of that,” he said. “And I doubt very  much that the diplomacy will  be effective if there’s not the prospect  that, if diplomacy fails, that we will, in fact, resort to military  force.”                                                                                                                              Since new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani came to power, the  White  House has begun an all-out effort to cool tensions between the   nations.                                                                                                                                                                 Administration officials, for example, recently suggested   it may be time to ease economic sanctions on Iran with the ultimate  goal  of a diplomatic solution to end that nation’s nuclear program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr.  Cheney, however, isn’t holding his breath.                                                                                                                   “I don’t have a lot of  confidence in the administration to be  able to negotiate an  agreement,” he said. “I’ve talked to my  friends in that part of the  region. I still know them, a lot of  them, and they’re very fearful that  the whole Iranian exercise is  going to go the same way as the Syrian  exercise. That is, that there will be bold talk from the  administration. But in the final  analysis, nothing effective will be  done about the Iranian [nuclear]  program.”
