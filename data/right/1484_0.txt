                 | November 12, 2020 09:00 AM                 | Updated Nov 12, 2020, 04:00 PM                A handful of peacekeepers, including several Americans, have reportedly died in a helicopter crash that occurred in the Sinai Peninsula.      The helicopter, which belonged to Multinational Force and Observers, crashed during "a routine mission in the vicinity of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt" on Thursday, the MFO said in a statement. Eight of the nine members involved in the crash died. The ninth member, an American, survived the crash and was evacuated and taken to a hospital.             Five of the members who died were U.S. citizens, one was French, and one was Czech, according to MFO. Earlier it was reported that six Americans had died.      The names of the victims have not been released until next of kin notifications are completed. The MFO said it will investigate the crash but that no signs pointed to anything but an accident at this point.      “We are saddened by the loss of 6 US and 2 partner nation service members in a helicopter crash in the Sinai Peninsula operating with the Multinational Force and Observers," acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said in a statement before the Pentagon lowered the number of Americans believed to have died to five. "Yesterday we recognized the sacrifice of millions who have defended our nation, and today we are reminded of the last full measure our warriors may pay for their service. I extend @DeptofDefense's condolences to the families, friends, and teammates of these service members."      Israeli and Egyptian officials told the Associated Press the crash appeared to be the result of a technical failure.      The MFO's website describes its mission as one to "supervise the implementation of the security provisions of the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace and employ best efforts to prevent any violation of its terms."      The Washington Examiner has reached out to the MFO and the State Department for comment.
