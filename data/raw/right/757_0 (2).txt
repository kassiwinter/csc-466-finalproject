           Some Republican senators are complaining that the bipartisan immigration bill grants too much leeway to White House officials in deciding how to administer the new reform system if its approved by Congress. The GOP critics are particularly worried about the power granted to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, The Hill reports.
“I’m concerned that the bill provides unfettered and unchecked authority to you and your department, and your successors,” Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told Napolitano Tuesday when she testified before the panel.
“It reminds me of the 1,693 delegations of authority in the healthcare reform bill that make it almost impossible for the average citizen to understand or predict how the law will be applied.”
Various portions of the law grant discretion to the Homeland Security secretary. For example, the secretary can waive a rule forbidding deported immigrants from applying for provisional legal status if they are outside the country.
“From my perspective, we’ve seen how this administration has abused waiver authority in the so-called Affordable Care Act to exempt political favorites from the law that applies to everybody else. I think this Congress’ job is to set the standard,” added Texas Sen. John Cornyn.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
