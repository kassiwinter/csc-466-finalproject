WASHINGTON—Republican House Speaker         John Boehner    once again is locked in contentious budget talks, which in the past have ended badly. This time, he is leading negotiations after months spent quietly winning the backing of his own party.The unruly freshman class of 2010 has thwarted Mr. Boehner numerous times during his two years as speaker. To bolster his position, Mr. Boehner has been slowly bringing Republican freshmen to his side by introducing them to the realities of legislating and congressional leadership. Mr. Boehner's strategy, and his future as speaker, will get tested between now and year-end as Washington wrestles with negotiations designed to avert tax increases and spending cuts due to begin in early January. Mr. Boehner and President         Barack Obama    met privately Sunday to discuss a budget deal, their first face-to-face meeting in weeks. On Monday, people close to the talks said negotiations were getting more "serious." They said big divisions remained but didn't give details. Mr. Boehner declined to comment for this article.                Mr. Boehner has used both carrot and stick to unify his ranks, lawmakers said. Rep.         Steve Southerland,    a voluble freshman, got a job managing a transportation bill. Three freshmen who continued to defy the House leadership on key votes got booted from plum committees. Others learned the limits of their power by watching bills the House passed disappear in the Senate.               "There's a lot more cohesiveness between our class and leadership," said Rep.         Dennis Ross    (R., Fla.), a member of the class of 2010 who voted against legislation pushed through by Mr. Boehner to raise the U.S.'s borrowing limit last year.      Mr. Boehner has to get any deal cut with Mr. Obama through the GOP-controlled House, without relying too heavily on Democratic votes. Mr. Boehner may still be forced to endure defections on any final deal, but his work thus far appears to have stopped his more conservative members from undermining his negotiating position.     "If you lose your conference—if you lose a majority of your people on an issue—then you're vulnerable, you're vulnerable as a leader," said former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican. "This is a big issue."     Unlike 2011, when he negotiated with Mr. Obama in secret, Mr. Boehner is doing all he can this time to bring both his allies and adversaries along for the ride—either toward a deal or over the fiscal cliff, lawmakers and aides said.     Mr. Boehner mended fences with his No. 2, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.), after the two repeatedly clashed over various budget negotiations, aides to both men said. He has made an overt effort to cultivate Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee and Mitt Romney's running mate. Mr. Ryan didn't embrace Mr. Boehner's efforts to negotiate a deficit deal in 2011. This year, he is sitting in on Mr. Boehner's daily strategy session and has endorsed the speaker's plan to raise fresh tax revenue.     The speaker was swept into power by the 2010 Republican wave. Many of the 87 Republican freshman first elected to Congress came to town determined to change how things were done.     Within weeks, lawmakers forced party leaders to pull legislation extending parts of the Patriot Act reauthorizing certain surveillance methods under the homeland security law. They made stinks about spending bills, tax bills and most notably whether or how to raise the debt ceiling, leading to a downgrade of the U.S.'s debt rating.     On the fiscal cliff, Mr. Boehner already has conceded that any deal must include new tax revenue, an idea long anathema to many Republicans. When the speaker proposed raising $800 billion through capping or eliminating tax deductions, it provoked a negative response from the president—who called it inadequate—but also from conservative members of Congress. Mr. Boehner still opposes the increase in top tax rates that the president has demanded.     In Mr. Boehner's corner are some Republicans who say the election results have forced them to revisit their stance on taxes. Rep.         Jack Kingston    (R., Ga.), a 20-year veteran of the House, said, "The election was a sober reminder that not every other person in America shares our views."     Rep. Southerland, the third-generation owner of funeral homes in the Florida Panhandle, had never served in elected office until he arrived in Washington two years ago, and wasn't shy about expressing his displeasure with party leaders.      In early 2011, when Republican leaders in the House were using stopgap spending bills to cut $1 billion a week from the federal budget, Mr. Southerland led a revolt of first-year lawmakers, arguing the piecemeal approach wouldn't win the sweeping cuts they wanted.     This spring, the speaker recruited Mr. Southerland to serve on a negotiating panel with Senate Democrats over a bill to finance highway construction and other transportation projects. Mr. Boehner told him, "We're going to fight on this one. And God knows, I know you love to fight," Mr. Southerland recalled.     Party leaders then leaned on Mr. Southerland to sell the resulting package to colleagues, helping Mr. Boehner pass legislation that faced conservative resistance. "We came in wanting to change the world and realized it doesn't move quite as fast as we would like," Mr. Southerland said.     Mr. Southerland said he is reserving judgment on any fiscal-cliff deal. "I will give them their best shot," Mr. Southerland said. "If there is something I can't believe in, I feel like I have the freedom and the ability to reject what they offer."     Rep. Ross of Florida, a 2010 freshman, was one of 66 House Republicans to vote against an increase in the country's borrowing limit last year. Today, he thinks the class has evolved after being forced to repeatedly confront the limits of its power, especially after the "brow beating" many received for opposing the debt-ceiling increase.     The Florida Republican signed a pledge not to raise taxes but said he is open to Mr. Boehner's call to raise revenue as part of a deal, provided that package also includes structural changes to entitlement programs, including Medicare and Social Security.     "We have to go into this with the understanding that we're going to get criticism for what we do, regardless," he said.      The class also learned to pick its battles. Last December, the House refused to pass a two-month extension of a popular payroll tax cut approved in a deal by their colleagues in the Senate. That caused an uproar, and the House eventually passed the extension.      "It was a reality check for us," said Rep.         James Lankford    (R., Okla.), a member of the class of 2010 who was recently elected to the leadership.     The speaker showed a harder edge last week when he and other party leaders removed three freshmen from prime committee slots for consistently bucking the party line, evidence to some that while party leaders want their troops to cooperate, they are willing to punish those who don't.     "This is clearly a vindictive move and a sure sign that the GOP establishment cannot handle disagreement," said Rep.         Tim Huelskamp    (R., Kan.), who lost his seat on the House Budget Committee.     Boehner spokesman         Michael Steel    cautioned against reading too much into the removals, saying the panel that assigns lawmakers to committees "makes such decisions for a variety of reasons."
