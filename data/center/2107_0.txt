         Ammon Bundy,    the man leading armed protesters in the takeover of a federal building on a wildlife refuge in Oregon, said in an interview late Sunday night that the group doesn't want a confrontation with law-enforcement officials, but would defend itself if necessary.“We have no intention of being aggressive at all,” Mr. Bundy said by telephone. “We would not fire on them unless they fired on us.” Mr. Bundy is a son of         Cliven Bundy,    the Nevada rancher who gained national attention in a similar armed standoff with federal officials in 2014 over unpaid grazing fees.

They are protesting what they say is the expansion of federal government control over land that has pushed out people who use the land for work and recreation.               In a written statement released late Sunday night, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it “is working with the Harney County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police and other local and state law enforcement agencies to bring a peaceful resolution to the situation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.”     But it declined to release specifics of any response, “due to safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved.”     The takeover this weekend took place after protesters rallied around local ranchers Dwight and         Steven Hammond,    a father and son convicted of arson on public lands in 2012.     The Hammonds said they set fires as preventive burns, a tactic sometimes used to keep wildfires from spreading. The government said they set one fire in 2001 to cover up illegal deer hunting. Steven Hammond, the son, was also convicted of setting a fire that spread to public lands in 2006.          The pair was ordered back to prison to serve the mandated prison sentence of five years, after first being given lesser sentences by a judge. They agreed to report to prison after the holidays on Monday, Jan. 4, according to Oregon Acting U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams.     Mr. Bundy said on Sunday night that the group had deployed “security details for protection…looking out for any threat” around the campuslike area of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon’s Harney County, where they say they are hunkered down indefinitely.     He said the group “is gaining a lot of numbers” as more people arrive from around the country, but would not disclose the number “for security reasons.”     Meanwhile, the group was beginning to form committees to “work out the land transactions here in Harney County so we can assist people in claiming their rights back,” Mr. Bundy said.     Mr. Bundy, who runs a commercial trucking business in Phoenix, says he and his group plan to remain on the wildlife refuge building indefinitely.     “We are taking a stand against these atrocities,” he said. “Harney County has been grossly abused” by expansion of federal control of lands, he said.     Landowners and their supporters who have been battling the federal government over issues of access and control of lands see the case of the Hammonds as the latest example of government overreach that Mr. Bundy argues is running Americans off federal land, and “driving them into poverty.”     However, prosecutors argued that the Hammonds’ actions threatened the safety of hunters and firefighters.     “The Hammonds received a fair trial…they were found guilty by a jury of their peers,” Mr. Williams said in a recent open letter. “We stand by the ultimate resolution of this case.”     Mr. Bundy said he hasn’t spoken to the Hammonds recently and doesn’t know if he has their support.     In a Dec. 11 letter to Harney County Sheriff David Ward, the Hammonds’ lawyer, W. Alan Schroeder wrote, “Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family.”     Mr. Schroeder didn't respond to a call or email seeking comment.     Sheriff Ward didn't return a call or emails seeking comment. He told people to stay away from the building as authorities work to defuse the situation, the Oregonian reported.     “For the time being please stay away from that area. More information will be provided as it becomes available. Please maintain a peaceful and united front and allow us to work through this situation,” Sheriff Ward said in a statement according to the newspaper.     Mr. Bundy said Sunday he hasn't been in direct contact with law-enforcement officials. He said he has gotten support from some local residents, and from others around the country who he says responded to his message on         Facebook    calling for supporters to come to Oregon.     “Our goal is to work with the local people that are the land users, the loggers and the ranchers, the hunters and the hikers and the recreationists in opening up these lands so they can use them,” Mr. Bundy said. “We fully expect to be here for months, absolutely.”     —--The Associated Press contributed to this article.
