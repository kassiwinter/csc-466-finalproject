   President Donald Trump walked across Pennsylvania Avenue Monday night as the District of Columbia‚Äôs 7 p.m. curfew went into effect following brief remarks in the White House Rose Garden.
In his primetime speech to a nation in peril, Trump pledged to bring ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù to a nation in anarchy before observing the damage at the historic St. John‚Äôs church.

While protestors outside the White House gates were chanting in the background, Trump pledged to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops in the absence of state action to quell the violent protests destroying the nation‚Äôs cities following the death of George Floyd in police custody. President Trump speaks in the Rose Garden:
"We cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful to be drowned out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president, I will fight to keep them safe." pic.twitter.com/V3OqCjMjWA

‚ÄúMy administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served,‚Äù Trump said¬†following days of rioting and tweeting. ‚ÄúHe will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries¬†of peaceful protestors to be drowned out by an angry mob.‚Äù
Trump pointed to the ruthless actions of the rioters assaulting innocent civilians, destroying small businesses even if they are minority owned and defacing sacred monuments.
Innocent people of have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street. Or the woman in upstate New York, viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York‚Äôs finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses, who have battled the virus, are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct station has been overrun. Here in the nation‚Äôs capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African-American enforcement hero, was shot and killed.
These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror. Standing in front of St. John's Church, boarded up against violent protests, and with senior staff at his side, plus Attorney General Barr, Pres Trump says "we have the greatest country in the world." Holding a Bible, he says he'll keep the country "nice and safe." pic.twitter.com/2jxOMz44rd
