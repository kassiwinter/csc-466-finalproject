           GOP political commentator Ana Navarro is calling on Republicans to "disavow" nominee Donald Trump, saying he hasn't met even the "minimum requirement of morality."
In a panel discussion on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360," Navarro slammed Trump in the wake of 2005 audio and video recordings in which he bragged that he could kiss and grope women because he was a star. "There is a minimum requirement of morality," Navarro said of presidential contenders, saying his remarks showed he was "incapable of meeting that minimum requirement."
"It's time to think, for Republicans to disavow this man," she said. "[House Speaker] Paul Ryan, you cannot stand by this man tomorrow," she added, referring to an event in Wisconsin in which both Trump and Ryan are scheduled to appear.
Republican National Committee chairman "Reince Priebus, the same goes for you," she added.
Amanda Carpenter, a former communications director for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, also condemned the remarks.
"He felt he was entitled to assault woman because he had power," she said, adding that she felt that indicated "I really don't think there's any limit."
"I hope [Indiana Governor and vice presidential nominee] Mike Pence examines his heart, his soul … Maybe Christians can forgive … but that does not give him a pass."
Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes, however, said Hillary Clinton's "actions are even worse."
"Let's talk about the things that matter to … most women in the world," she said, referring to Trump's campaign policies.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
