It was Jobs Friday, when for one ever-so-brief moment the interests of Wall Street, Washington and Main Street are all aligned on one thing: jobs.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 255,000 in July. Revisions showed U.S. employers added 18,000 more jobs in May and June than previously estimated. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9% in July. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected employers would add 179,000 jobs in July alongside an unemployment rate of 4.8%.     Here at MoneyBeat HQ, we crunched the numbers, tracked the markets and compiled the commentary about the report in real time. Feel free to continue the conversation in the comments section. Here's how it all went down:          9:55 am | Thanks for joining us | by Erik Holm     With the Dow up 149 points and the S&P 500 up 0.6% in record territory, we'll leave it with that scene from the woods of Maine.     Thanks for joining us.      9:48 am | Even in the woods of Maine, economists are talking about this report | by Aaron Kuriloff                                                               Illustration:            AP                                                                                                             Economists and asset managers gathered at a fishing retreat in Grand Lake Stream, Maine, huddled around a laptop running Bloomberg software in a lakeside dining hall and cheered the jobs report when it came out.     The group had discussed the number all morning at the annual “Camp Kotok” fishing trip – named for organizer David Kotok, chief investment officer at Sarasota-based Cumberland Advisors. After a breakfast spent evaluating previous swings in the nonfarm payrolls and debating its efficacy as a tool of predicting markets, some said the strong number helped mitigate concerns about weakness in prior reports and highlighted ongoing trend of moderate job growth the U.S.     “It’s all good news,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. “It should be ultimately be positive news for corporate earnings, though perhaps not today, if the market’s concerned this brings Fed tightening closer to the present.”     You can read more of Aaron Kuriloff’s dispatch from Camp Kotok here.     9:39 am | Defending the September call | by Ben Eisen     The consensus seems to be that the Fed will lift rates in December, but September does have its defenders. Here's Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz:     "The print should boost FOMC members’ confidence in the outlook, especially following the unexpected weakness in Q2 GDP. We continue to expect the Fed to hike rates at its September meeting, and we look to Chair Yellen’s appearance at the Jackson Hole Policy Symposium on August 26 for confirmation of this view. 9:36 am | 'There’s so much else going on' | by Corrie Driebusch     Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, doesn't think today's report is enough for the Fed to act in September. He notes that with such a strong jobs number, one could have expected bonds to react more forcefully.     “There’s so much else going on, so many other dynamics taking place in the sovereign markets,” he said, admitting that he in particular has been hoping for a big move in bond yields. “I’ve been short treasuries since 2011, so that gives you an idea how smart I am,” he joked.     9:33 am | A look at the longer-term trend | by Erik Holm     Almost all of more than 10 million jobs added since the recession officially ended in mid-2009 have been full-time positions.                                                                                                                                                     You can see more charts showing longer-term employment trends in our "July Jobs Report in 15 Charts."      9:31 am | Green open | by Ben Eisen     And we're off to the races.     The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% at the open to 2170.35.     The Dow climbed 97 points, or 0.5%, to 18450.8.     9:29 am | Better, yes, but does it change the trend? | by Paul Vigna     Okay, the headline number was way above Street consensus. Did it really change anything fundamental, though?     Lindsey Group's Peter Boockvar runs through the numbers:     Bottom line, job growth in July was clearly better than feared and brings the three-month average to 190,000 and the six-month average to 189,000. This compares to worries about a new 150,000 trend that was seen last month. The private sector is where the trend remains around 150,000 however as the three-month average for this most important part of the economy is at 158,000 vs 169,000 over the past six-months and vs 221,000 in 2015 and 240,000 in 2014. Thus, the slowing trend remains the same. We must keep in mind that IF the U.S. economy is now on a below 2% trend and corporate profits and margins continue to remain challenged, we should not expect an acceleration in job growth and remember that this key data point is typically a lagging indicator. I cheer today’s better than expected report but the recent trend is unaltered if we look at the private sector. Now, including the public and private sector, the average jobs growth through seven months of the year is 186,000, up from the average of 175,000 before this morning's numbers get added in.      However, that is a notable slide from the 228,000 average of 2015, and 251,000 in 2014. It's even a notch lower than the 193,000 average in 2013. It is (now) better than the 177,000 average from 2012.     9:23 am | Gold could sill go higher | by Stephanie Yang     Gold for December delivery was recently down 1.1% at $1,352.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and traded as low as $1,347.10 following the release of the U.S. jobs numbers.     Still, many traders say that the longer-term catalysts for gold to move higher are still in play.     “We still have to deal with the fact that while we look good, those around us don’t,” said Ira Epstein, market strategist at the Linn Group, referring to the strength of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world.     9:21 am | Dow vs. the S&P | by Ben Eisen     After the jobs report, S&P 500 futures are up 0.4%, while the Dow futures are up more than 100 points at 0.6%.     What accounts for the difference in performance? It has little to do with the jobs report itself.     One of the 30 Dow components is Merck & Co. Inc., whose futures are up almost 10% before the open, and that's dragging the Dow disproportionately higher. That’s after a rival drugmaker’s trial failed to meet its primary endpoint. From the WSJ story:     “Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said a trial investigating its blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo as a therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint. Meanwhile, shares of Merck & Co. rose 11% as the results suggest sales of its rival immunotherapy cancer drug Keytruda could benefit from the trial’s failure. In June, Merck’s similar trial investigating the use of Keyruda for the same condition met its primary endpoint. The drug prolonged survival versus chemotherapy, though Merck hasn’t released full details yet.” 9:19 am | A “hawkish signal for the Fed” | by Chelsey Dulaney     Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Crédit Agricole, said the report should support the dollar against its major peers. He said the growth in wages especially is a “hawkish signal for the Fed.”     ”Any upside surprising in earnings could be an indication that inflation pressures are building,” said Mr. Serebriakov.      The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 0.3%, after being down 0.3% ahead of the report. The dollar rose 0.3% to ¥101.51, while the euro fell 0.4% to $1.1087.     9:13 am | Jobs report not good enough to put September on the table | by Paul Vigna     Why isn't the market more worried about a rate hike?     "Overall, the labor market figures would appear to support a near-term rate hike," said Paul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Unfortunately, the activity data is not as upbeat." This morning's trade figures are likely to put the revised second-quarter GDP figure at less than 1%, he said. :As a result, we still expect the Fed to wait until December before hiking the fed funds rate again."     9:09 am | The question for the Fed is... | by WSJ Staff     The question for the Fed is how to balance the risk of choking off the expansion too early versus the risk of an inflationary uptick.     — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) August 5, 2016     9:08 am | 'Better-than-bland and somewhat reassuring' | by Paul Vigna     After the last few economic reports, the market is just happy to get one that doesn't come with a horror-movie soundtrack.     Mark Hamrick, the senior economist at Bankrate.com, summed it up:     After the jolting swings in the payrolls numbers seen over the previous two months, we welcome a better-than-bland and somewhat reassuring report which indicates hiring in July edged above this year’s trend. Manufacturing continues to struggle in the face of a less-than-supportive global backdrop, but the U.S. economy is hanging tough. we do hope and can reasonably expect that as long as the jobless rate remains firm or goes lower, that we should see further improvement on the all-important worker pay front. 9:07 am | Behind the muted response in bonds | by Ben Eisen     The Treasury market's reaction to the strong jobs data is fairly muted, given the magnitude of the surprise.     The 30-year bond yield is up just 0.01 percentage point at 2.267% and the 10-year yield is up 0.03 percentage point at 1.53%. Intermediate-term yields are climbing a bit more, but it's hard to call that a spike in yields.     For the market, the jobs data comes down to what impact it will have on the Fed's timeline for raising rates. One hike may now be on the table, but that may not mean much in an environment where other central banks are cutting rates (see: Bank of England on Thursday).     As Jim Vogel of FTN Financial puts it: "Bottom Line: The analysis behind the Bank of England easing program has more influence on interest rates than US payroll growth."     9:06 am | Construction a soft spot | by Kevin Kingsbury                                                               Illustration:            David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson sees a hole in the recent jobs data, the past two months’ noted gains notwithstanding.     Today’s report “is not without its imperfections when it comes to housing. Two months of strong job growth hides the letdown in construction jobs. For the first time since August 2014, residential investment was a drag on US GDP in the second quarter. The dearth of homes available for sale and lack of affordable new construction have challenged homebuyers in 2016. A pickup in construction jobs is a missing piece of the housing puzzle that would help homebuyers, job seekers and the economy at large.”     8:55 am | Is the Fed eyeing December? | by Ben Eisen     Kathy Jones, Schwab's chief fixed income strategist, weighs in with the view that December could be the go date for the Fed's next rate rise:     "All in all, it means we should see a rate hike from the Fed this year. Whether it’s September or December, I’m on the fence. I still lean more toward December. I think there's a preference to allow the economy to heat up a bit more." 8:53 am | Professional and business services added 70,000 jobs | by Paul Vigna     Want to know what is actually the best takeaway from this report? The fact that the sector that created the most jobs this month was "professional and business services" (the BLS has a breakdown of the sector here). This is a broad category, it's almost a catch-all, everything from programmers to temps, but it does include a lot of high-paying jobs.     Within the group, "professional and technical services" added 37,000, led by computer systems design and related services, which added 8,000 jobs, and architectural and engineering services, which added 7,000.     Wages for this group overall rose 2.9%, to $905.61 a week, from $880.05 last July.     Financial services, another sector with a lot of good-paying jobs, added 18,000 bodies.     8:50 am | "The Fed will signal at least one more rate increase" | by Erik Holm     Navy Federal Credit Union corporate economist Alan MacEachin tells us that he expects Fed officials will be signaling that a 2016 rate hike remains on the table after this report.      "The soft patch in the labor market from earlier this year appears to be over, and jobs growth has returned to its 200K-per-month trend," MacEachin says. "This suggests employers are still confident and feel business prospects are strong enough to justify continues payroll growth. I expect the Fed will signal at least one more rate increase is likely this year as a result of this report."     8:45 am | Yield curve flattens | by Ben Eisen     The differential between short-term and long-term Treasury yields, one widely watched measure of market-based economic expectations, has been shrinking.     The 2-year yield climbed 0.05 percentage points to 0.69%, while the 30-year bond yield climbed 0.3 percentage points to 2.284%. The gap between them still isn't as small as it was in early July, when it was at multi-year lows.     The so-called yield curve has historically flattened when long-term yields price in lower economic growth and inflation expectations, while the short-term rates bake in higher interest rates. The gap tends to narrow before recessions, but investors say other factors are flattening the yield curve this economic cycle.     8:44 am | Plug this one into your Fed calculator | by Paul Vigna                                                               Illustration:            Associated Press                                                                                                             I certainly wouldn’t go so far as to say this number means a September hike is a done-deal; in fact, I personally don’t think this number could have possibly been high enough to make that true. However, this report does raise the odds on another hike. The timing, though, remains a maze.     The next three meetings are Sept. 20-21, Nov. 1-2, and Dec. 26-27. Is the Fed really going to raise rates a week before the presidential election? Or right after Christmas, still in the holiday season? In fact, if they want to raise rates at all, September might their only “clean” month. On the other hand, if they raise rates, they are definitely pushing against every other major central bank.     Meanwhile, keep in mind that we’re talking about 25 little basis points. At this pace, all the bitcoin in the world will be mined before the Fed is done “normalizing” rates.     8:41 am | Broader measure ticks up | by Joshua Mitchell     While overall unemployment remained at 4.9% last month, a broader measure rose to 9.7% from 9.6% in June. That measure reflects jobless workers, those stuck in part-time jobs and those too discouraged to look for work. It stood at 10.4% a year ago.      8:40 am | Best two-month stretch since last year | by Erik Holm     Taken together, June and July mark the best two-month stretch of job growth since late last year.     (Both will be revised, but it's true for now at least.)     8:39 am | Rate hikes ahead? | by Ben Eisen     Fed funds futures, which these days seem to react pretty quickly to economic data, are already suggesting higher chances of a rate rise in September.     As of 8:35 ET, there's an 18% chance the Fed will lift rates versus a 9% chance on Thursday, according to CME data.     There's now a 43% chance the Fed will lift rates by December, higher than the 32% probability on Thursday, according to CME     8:35 am | Risk on trade | by Ben Eisen     With the blowout number, other markets are acting about as you'd expect.     Gold is down nearly 1%. Silver is down almost 2%.     The dollar climbed 0.3% against the Japanese yen and the euro fell 0.3% against the dollar.     8:35 am | Labor force participation rate inches higher | by Paul Vigna     The labor force participation rate was 62.8%, up a tick from 62.7% a month ago, and up from 62.6% a year ago.     8:34 am | Mining continues to trend down | by Erik Holm     Job gains occurred in professional and business services, health care, and financial activities. Mining employment continued to trend down.     Professional and business services added 70,000 jobs in July and has added 550,000 jobs over the past 12 months.      Health care employment increased by 43,000, and has added 477,000 jobs in the past year.     Employment in financial activities rose by 18,000 in July and has risen by 162,000 over the year.     Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in July, adding 45,000.     Government employment edged up too, adding 38,000.     Employment in mining continued to trend down over the month, falling by 6,000 jobs. Since reaching a peak in September 2014, employment in this industry has fallen by 220,000, or 26%.     8:33 am | Market jolt | by Ben Eisen     Benchmark yields popped after the report. The 10-year yield is up about 0.03 percentage points at 1.532%, indicating lower prices.     S&P 500 futures also jumped after the the report, now up 0.3% at 2165.50. Dow futures are up 0.4%.     8:33 am | Average hours rose slightly | by Paul Vigna     The average workweek rose 0.1 hour, to 34.5 hours.     8:33 am | May and June revised higher | by Erik Holm     In addition to the headline beat, the past two months were also revised higher.     The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised from a paltry gain of 11,000 to a slightly less paltry 24,000. June, already a blockbuster, was revised from +287,000 to +292,000.     With these revisions, employment gains in May and June combined were 18,000 more than previously reported. Over the past 3 months, job gains have averaged 190,000 per month.     8:32 am | Private sector added 217,000 | by Paul Vigna     The private sector added 217,000 jobs, and the public sector added 38,000.     8:32 am | Average hourly earnings up 2.6% from a year ago | by Paul Vigna     Average hourly earnings were up 8 cents on the month, to $25.69. They're up 2.6% from a year ago.     8:31 am | Unemployment rate flat at 4.9% | by Paul Vigna     255,000 jobs were created in July, well above consensus of 179,000. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.9%.     8:30 am | 255,000 in July | by Paul Vigna     255,000.     8:23 am | Good reasons to take the over | by Paul Vigna     There are three reasons why this morning's report will come in higher than expected, SouthBay Research's Andrew Zatlin said.     Payrolls will get a boost from 3 areas:- July's Republican and Democratic National conventions which drew 100,000 visitors.- A positive Seasonal Adjustment.- Slight acceleration in hiring now that business conditions have become clearer (still low, but uncertainty has faded). He predicts 208,000 jobs, with 198,000 coming from the private sector.     8:18 am | Don't be surprised by two-handle job growth | by Kevin Kingsbury     Low jobless claims have helped highlight why steady six-figure monthly employment growth has been occurring in the U.S.–May’s dour number notwithstanding. With June’s figure offsetting that report, I’m of the belief that today’s growth figure is liable to surprise to the upside. Claims on a seasonally adjusted basis remain near four-decade lows. And on an unadjusted basis, last week’s 220,000 initial claims were the lowest for any final week of July; the Labor Department’s data go back to 1967. A 200,000-plus increase for employment today seems easily in reach.     8:17 am | Watch wages | by Erik Holm     Jobs growth this year has been slower than in 2015, but as our Steven Russolillo notes in his Ahead of the Tape column today, that’s consistent with labor-market performance in the latter stages of economic expansions.     As he says:     If that is true, the number to watch is average hourly earnings, which rose 2.6% in June, matching the biggest increase since 2009. That would show that hiring is slowing as workers become scarcer and, therefore, more expensive. Higher wages often translate into inflation. That is one reason the jobs report has broader implications for the Federal Reserve. You can read more from him here.      8:16 am | What's the Fed looking for? | by Paul Vigna     As always, a paramount concern is how this report affects the Fed's thinking in terms of rate hikes, and, as always, this morning's numbers will have to be plugged into the trend to see how things look from up on high. That said, if the numbers come in as expected, it could be a big chip in the "raise" pile.     Dennis Gartman explains, from his morning newsletter:     Mr. Kaplan, the President of the Fed Dallas, said earlier this week that he wants to see this report a “healthy margin above 125,000” before he shall err toward tighter monetary policies. He’ll almost certainly get that in today’s number for the consensus on The Street has payrolls rising 185,000, within a rather wide range from 150 thousand on the low side by the economic pessimist to 215 thousand on the high side by the optimists among us. Remember that last month this number was +287 thousand. 8:11 am | Labor market isn't the problem | by Ben Eisen                                                               Illustration:            Getty Images                                                                                                             As we noted in our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter this morning, the labor force hasn't been a problem for the U.S. economy--but lots of other data is painting a gloomier picture.     The economy grew at a 1.2% annual rate during the April-June period, according to Commerce Department data released last week. Combined with a weak first quarter, GDP is on track to grow 1% this year, the slowest start to a year since 2011.     Inflation has also been lackluster. The personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, climbed 0.9% from a year earlier, data showed Tuesday. Inflation has lagged the Fed’s 2% annual target for over four years.     It’s becoming increasingly clear that the Fed wants to see a pick-up in major economic data beyond the labor market before it lifts rates much further.     A particularly strong jobs report, of course, could help change that, and push investors to believe the Fed may lift rates sooner than expected. That may be particularly true if wage inflation measures within the report rise noticeably.     But if headline numbers merely meet expectations and earnings growth remains lackluster, don’t expect perceptions to change much.     8:07 am | Stocks slightly higher heading into jobs report | by Paul Vigna     Traders have a pretty constructive setup here in the market this morning heading into the report. S&P futures are up about 4 points, and Dow futures are up 21 points. That of course isn't too surprising; nobody's going to place a big wager either way ahead of the numbers.     The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note has slipped back under 1.50%, at 1.49%, but that's not too surprising, either, what with U.K. bonds coming down, and Germany and Japan still in negative territory.     Crude oil is down about 0.6% at $41.67. The price fell back under $40 a barrel earlier this week, but jumped sharply yesterday. This one's getting rowdy again.     The dollar is down slightly against the yen, at 101.054, and the euro is up against the dollar, at 1.1162.     8:05 am | Out of Work | by Jeffrey Sparshott     The forecast for the July unemployment rate is 4.8%.     That headline number was 4.9% in June while a broader measure, which also captures discouraged and marginally attached workers, hit 9.6%, the lowest level since April 2008. As we noted in our "5 Things to Watch," the alternate number should continue to slowly decline if the economy continues to add jobs.     8:03 am | Jobs report should reflect more labor expansion | by Jeffrey Sparshott     U.S. employment numbers have bounced around this year, from growth of as little as 11.000 in May to the initially reported 287,000 for June. For July, economists are expecting nonfarm payrolls climbed a seasonally adjusted 179,000, slower than 2015's 229,000 monthly average but not far off this year's trend.     That kind of steady job growth would be enough to absorb new entrants and perhaps draw some people into the workforce while holding unemployment near current levels.
