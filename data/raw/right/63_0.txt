President Biden on Wednesday will hail the US passing 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses administered — as the nation expands eligibility to all Americans over age 16. According to CDC data, more than 213 million doses were administered as of Wednesday, enough to cover 51 percent of the adult population. Biden’s remarks around 1:15 p.m. will promote expanding access to reach herd immunity to end the COVID-19 pandemic. A White House official who briefed select journalists ahead of Biden’s remarks said he will outline how his administration plans to reach the crucial threshold. Last week, the Biden administration unexpectedly paused distribution of the only one-shot COVID-19 vaccine, from Johnson & Johnson, after seven reports of blood clots — including one fatality — out of nearly 7 million shots administered.

The first two vaccines — from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — were approved in December while Trump was president.

Although he was vaccinated, he regularly wears double masks and has urged Americans to consider small backyard gatherings for the Fourth of July, drawing Republican ridicule due to low outdoor transmission rates and the high efficacy of vaccines.
