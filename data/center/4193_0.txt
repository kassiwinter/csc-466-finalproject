                                          By Morgan Gstalter - 04/27/19 12:23 PM EDT                                                        The New York Times Opinion section on Saturday apologized for a political cartoon that included anti-Semitic tropes.The image, published in the international print edition of Thursday’s paper, featured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuBenjamin (Bibi) NetanyahuMORE as a guide dog wearing a Star of David collar leading President TrumpDonald TrumpHillicon Valley — Cyberattack hits Ukrainian defense On The Money — GOP senators block Biden's Fed picks Florida county clerk's typo directed ticketed drivers to site selling Trump merchandise MORE, who is wearing a skullcap and dark glasses.An Editors' Note to appear in Monday’s international edition. pic.twitter.com/1rl2vXoTB3— New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) April 27, 2019“The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it,” the newspaper said in a tweet. “It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it.”2. Here’s the anti-Semitic cartoon that the NYT published pic.twitter.com/ucLCLIyTgJ— Yashar Ali (@yashar) April 27, 2019The cartoon was quickly denounced by social media users.Imam Mohamad Tawhidi, a Muslim peace advocate in Australia, condemned the cartoon on Twitter, saying it served “an ISIS agenda.”“If you’re wondering what type of photo ISIS’ Al-Baghdadi would hang on his wall, look no further than the @nytimes cartoon displaying Jewish people as dogs. Militant Islamist texts refer to Jewish people as “the ancestors of pigs, monkeys and dogs. Shame.”Serving an ISIS AgendaIf you’re wondering what type of photo ISIS’ Al-Baghdadi would hang on his wall, look no further than the @nytimes cartoon displaying Jewish people as dogs.

The NYT really did print this #antisemitic cartoon in its international edition; found it in Tel Aviv @LTCPeterLerner @AdamMilstein @HenMazzig @GippersChutzpah #shame pic.twitter.com/cLnqYGTlCO— Seth Frantzman (@sfrantzman) April 27, 2019The cartoon is disgusting and sloppy, more so for being printed in NYTimes. Good that they issued a statement, retracted it but this is alarming. Many publications peddle anti-semitism, racism, Islomophobia in Middle East but they are not the New York Times. Unfortunate. https://t.co/HlxMWJ6TPa— Joyce Karam (@Joyce_Karam) April 27, 2019This cartoon, which appeared in The New York Times’ international edition yesterday, is vile and inexcusable, especially at a time when attacks against Jews around the world are reaching levels not seen in decades. pic.twitter.com/pFGgrwtBPu— Melissa Weiss (@melissaeweiss) April 27, 2019                                                    The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are © 1998 - 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
