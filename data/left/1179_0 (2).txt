Republicans stressed a 'security-first' approach to immigration reform on the Sunday morning talk shows, but its prospects for making it to the president's desk this year are far from certain, said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.)."I really don't know the answer to that question, that is clearly in doubt," Ryan said when asked by ABC News's "This Week" host GeorgeÂ Stephanopoulos whether reform could reach the White House by year's end.If both house can agree to a reform that is primarily focused on security, "then we might be able to get somewhere," Ryan said. "But I just don't know if that's going to be the case."House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) echoed that sentiment in other appearances. Jindal urged a security-first approach, arguing that the current approach to immigration is "completely backwards" by making legal immigration too difficult and illegal immigration too easy, he said on CNN's "State of the Union."President Obama told CNN's Jake Tapper that he considered the fact that House Republicans are preparing guidelines for reform a sign of progress."There is a desire to get it done and that, particularly in this Congress, is a huge piece of business," he said.
