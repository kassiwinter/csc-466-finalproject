"But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career."

"Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the Board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action." Mr Moonves, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS, has yet to respond to BBC requests for comment.Six women have made allegations against him, including the actress Illeana Douglas who told the New Yorker that he violently kissed her."The physicality of it was horrendous," she said. "You think, how long is this going to go on? I couldn't get him off me."All of the women say they believe their careers suffered because they rejected his advances.
