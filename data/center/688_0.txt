Spread of the virus may be possible before symptoms are apparent.Of note: "Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President," White House spokesperson Judd Deere said in a statement to reporters on Saturday. Those "in close contact" include reporters in the White House, per a pool report.Catch up quick: Trump indicated at a Friday press conference that he'd "most likely" get tested for coronavirus.
