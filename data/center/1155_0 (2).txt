New Jersey Republican Gov.         Chris Christie    battled a rapidly unfolding scandal Thursday that threatened to derail his presidential ambitions, jettisoning two close advisers and apologizing for a traffic jam allegedly orchestrated by aides as retribution against a Democratic mayor."I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team," Mr. Christie said at the beginning of a nearly two-hour, nationally televised news conference. "Ultimately, I am responsible for what happens under my watch," he later added.                                         New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fires one of his top aides linked to lane closures at one of the world's busiest bridges.

He also parted ways with his former campaign manager, saying he was uncomfortable with the way he talked about the closures in emails released on Wednesday. The governor said he first heard of his staff's involvement Wednesday.     Hours after the end of Thursday's lengthy news conference, Mr. Christie arrived in the Hudson River town of Fort Lee, N.J., on the opposite side of the bridge from New York City, to apologize to the mayor and residents. "He said he wasn't involved," Mayor Mark Sokolich said of Mr. Christie. "And you know what, we accept that."               U.S. Justice Department officials said Thursday they would scrutinize whether the lane closures, which snarled traffic for days, violated federal law. It wasn't immediately clear which federal statutes investigators might be contemplating. Meanwhile, New Jersey Democratic legislators said they would continue to issue subpoenas and didn't rule out calling Mr. Christie himself to answer questions under oath.     Mr. Christie's acts of contrition calmed some nerves among national Republican leaders, but they remained concerned about the possibility of future revelations, particularly in light of the fresh federal investigation and the continuing inquiry by a New Jersey Assembly committee controlled by Democrats.     Republicans in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire said Mr. Christie helped preserve his personal political brand ahead of the 2016 race by taking responsibility for the actions of his advisers, dismissing those at fault and addressing the charges head on.                                                 'I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.' — Gov. Chris Christie          Carlo Allegri/Reuters                                                                                                             "He answered every question that was out there and in a manner that didn't hedge," said Rich Killion, a Republican strategist there. "If everything plays out like he said it did, he should be fine up here with New Hampshire voters…[Voters] will give him credit for standing up and taking responsibility."     But in a note of caution, Mr. Killion said, "His enemy would be new information. Any new information that would conflict with what he said today would open a host of new problems for him."     Still, the crisis allowed some of Mr. Christie's harshest critics among conservatives, such as radio host Glenn Beck, to go after the popular governor and raise questions about his judgment and the culture within his political team.     The lane closures in Fort Lee in early September 2013 were initially described by the Christie administration and its allies at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as part of a traffic study. Until this week, the governor had brushed aside questions about whether the closures were retribution aimed at a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse the governor in his re-election bid. Mr. Christie joked once that he had moved traffic cones himself and denied that anyone on his staff was involved.     The Wall Street Journal reported in an Oct. 1 article that an email reviewed by the Journal showed that the executive director of the Port Authority had no knowledge of the lane closures, which he called "abusive" and dangerous.                                                                                                                                                     New Jersey Democrats, who control the state Legislature, seized on the issue and sent out subpoenas seeking emails and text messages by top Christie advisers. A selection of those documents released Wednesday contained a message from now-fired Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly weeks before the lane closures: "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."     "Got it," responded David Wildstein, a Christie ally at the Port Authority.     Ms. Kelly didn't respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Wildstein declined to testify Thursday before the legislative committee investigating the matter.     Mr. Christie on Thursday said he was blindsided by the revelations. In great detail, he described the moments on Wednesday morning when he stood in his bedroom after his workout, reading news reports and documents containing emails and text messages by some of his closest advisers.                                               New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he had no involvement or knowledge of lane closures at the George Washington Bridge that have set off a political firestorm in the state.

Christie at CEO Council           "You can only imagine, as I was standing there in my bedroom with my iPad looking at that, how incredibly sad and betrayed I felt," Mr. Christie said.     Mr. Christie also said he told Bill Stepien, his former campaign manager, to withdraw his name from consideration as head of the state GOP and to withdraw as a consultant to the Republican Governors Association, which Mr. Christie now leads.     Last month, Mr. Christie said that Mr. Stepien assured him he knew nothing about the bridge situation, which appeared to be contradicted by the documents released. In them, Mr. Stepien also called the Fort Lee mayor an "idiot."     "If I cannot trust someone's judgment, I cannot ask others to do so," Mr. Christie said. "I would not place him at the head of my political operation because of the lack of judgment that was shown."     Mr. Stepien didn't return requests for comment.     Mr. Christie also said that, a month ago, he gave his staff an hour to admit any involvement in the lane closures before he publicly discussed the incident. None did, he said Thursday. On Dec. 13, he publicly said no one from his administration was involved.     Above all else, Mr. Christie demands loyalty and trust from his inner circle, many of whom have worked with him for more than a decade, his aides said. When he took office in 2010, he brought with him some top staff from the U.S. attorney's office, which he led before being elected governor.      For weeks, interest from New Jersey Democrats had centered on Mr. Wildstein, who was identified by Port Authority officials as the person who directed the lane closures.     On Thursday, in the moments leading up to Mr. Christie's press conference, Mr. Wildstein unsuccessfully tried to fight a subpoena compelling him to testify in front of the state Assembly transportation panel. Instead, sitting in a committee room in the Trenton statehouse building later in the morning, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions.     Only a fraction of the 900 pages of heavily redacted correspondence has been released, and Democratic lawmakers said they are aiming higher.     "It seems to me silence is not golden here today," Democratic Assemblyman Thomas Giblin said. "Don't let David Wildstein be a fall guy on some of these issues that have taken place."     Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who is leading the investigation, asked Mr. Wildstein about one set of messages about scheduling that mentioned Port Authority Chairman David Samson, Mr. Christie and Mr. Wildstein, which Mr. Wisniewski suggested was evidence of a meeting. Mr. Wildstein declined to answer.     —Patrick O'Connor, Heather Haddon and E. Assata Wright contributed to this article.
