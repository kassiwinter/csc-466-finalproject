   On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Emily Domenech joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky to discuss how she banded with the Travis Manion Foundation to found The Honor Project and encourage Americans to gather to recognize the fallen on Memorial Day.
“Part of what makes The Honor Project really magical is it’s a stranger recognizing a stranger from far away and honoring their names, saying their name, sharing it with the rest of the world, and giving a moment to remember that person,” Domenech said. “I think most people, most civilians, go into Memorial Day and they know what it means, they know how important it is, they appreciate the military, but they haven’t got a clue how to reach out to touch those families who have really lost someone and they don’t have a clue how to really appropriately honor those who sacrifice.” “I think the lesson for civilians looking at our service members who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan today is to talk to them, ask them how they want their comrades to be remembered. Ask, ask them how they want their service appreciated,” Domenech said. “Because I think the Vietnam generation did not get that opportunity. And it’s only just now coming out how many of them sort of I think needed it and needed the ability to share with their family and friends their experience overseas. And I always find those stories to be really incredible.”
