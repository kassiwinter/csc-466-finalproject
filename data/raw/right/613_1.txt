                 | October 13, 2021 10:00 AM                The three biggest national TV networks ignored the national outcry yesterday over a Virginia father’s charge that a dress-wearing, gender-fluid boy sexually assaulted his ninth grade daughter.      As parents gathered before the Loudoun County School Board in the Washington, D.C., suburbs to demand the resignation of the superintendent of schools, news cameras from ABC, CBS, and NBC were nowhere to be found.            That prompted conservative media critic Brent Bozell, who heads the Media Research Center, to decry the media’s double standard of playing up favorite issues such as mask and vaccine mandates in schools but not the potentially harmful impact of liberal school policies.      In a tweet responding to the news blackout, he said, “SHAME. How can one call itself a news organization when it blacks out coverage of a story like this, which has such broad impact on the safety of our children and education? And they wonder why ratings and trust of the media continue to tank.”      Loudoun schools have been ground zero over several battles, including gender policies, critical race theory, and vaccine mandates.                       SHAME. How can one call itself a news organization when it blacks out coverage of a story like this, which has such broad impact on the safety of our children and education?

This week, the Daily Wire revealed what he was upset about — the assault on his daughter by a gender-fluid boy wearing a skirt in a girls bathroom.                       As Loudoun schools sought to pass a controversial transgender policy in June, it concealed that a 9th-grade girl was allegedly raped by a "gender fluid" student in a school bathroom just 3 weeks prior, The Daily Wire has learned.https://t.co/t5IEv1vZZF— Luke Rosiak (@lukerosiak) October 11, 2021                             The school board, however, has denied that there was an incident. The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office filed charges in the case.      The story did see airtime on Fox News and its top shows last night.
