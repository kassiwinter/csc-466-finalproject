WASHINGTON—Hillary Clinton used more than a dozen email devices during her time as secretary of state, and a technician took steps to delete an archive of her emails after House lawmakers demanded they be saved, according to documents released Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The newly public information also shows that Mrs. Clinton was warned at the outset of her tenure by former Secretary of State         Colin Powell    that her work-related email messages could become subject to public release. And in an interview with FBI agents in July, the Democratic presidential candidate offered a defense of her handling of sensitive drone-strike conversations.                                         The names of three top Clinton aides continue to surface in newly publicized emails, putting them at the center of the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains who they are and how they ended up in Clintons' inner circle.

The FBI said it was releasing the material in the interests of transparency.        
Related        On Friday, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said, “We are pleased that the FBI has released the materials from Hillary Clinton’s interview, as we had requested.” He added, “While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case.”               The documents disclosed few dramatic new facts, but they painted a picture of Mrs. Clinton as inattentive to computer security and unsophisticated about the classification system. They also confirmed a Wall Street Journal report in June that the FBI was especially concerned about email exchanges including Mrs. Clinton that concerned possible drone strikes.     Much in the documents is redacted, with information removed for security, privacy or other reasons, leaving significant gaps in the FBI’s information and conclusions.     The report contains the descriptions of an email exchange between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Powell, secretary of state under President George W. Bush, in which Mr. Powell warned her two days after she became secretary that if her use of a         BlackBerry    became “public,” her emails could become part of the “official record and subject to the law.”     “Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data,” said Mr. Powell. A spokeswoman for Mr. Powell didn’t respond to a request for comment.      Weeks later, Mrs. Clinton would switch from using a commercial email service to a private email server controlled by her family. Mrs. Clinton told the FBI that Mr. Powell’s comments didn’t factor into her decision to use a personal email account. She and her aides have said they believed that the State Department was preserving her emails that were sent to others.      The FBI also found that Mrs. Clinton used 13 BlackBerry mobile devices over the years, as well as several iPads. The FBI requested that those devices be turned over, but attorneys for Mrs. Clinton said they couldn’t be found. Her attorneys did turn over three iPads to the bureau.      “The FBI does not have in its possession any of Clinton’s 13 mobile devices which potentially were used to send e-mails using Clinton’s clintonemail.com addresses,” the report says. “As a result, the FBI could not make a determination as to whether any of the devices were subject to compromise.”     Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said on Friday that the material confirmed that Mrs. Clinton was careless with national secrets. “The documents released by the FBI today reinforce my concern that Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was reckless and put our nation’s secrets at risk,” Mr. Johnson said.      The FBI report also said a technical staffer at a company helping maintain Mrs. Clinton’s email server told law enforcement officials that he had an “oh shit” moment when he realized he had forgotten to delete an archive of Mrs. Clinton’s emails from his company’s systems, as had been requested by Mrs. Clinton’s attorneys in late 2014.     After Mrs. Clinton’s private email server became public in 2015, the staffer realized that he had never made the deletion and took steps to purge the files. That occurred after the Republican-led House Benghazi committee had ordered Mrs. Clinton’s emails preserved in March 2015. Mrs. Clinton herself said that month that she wanted her emails released to the public.     The FBI said in the report that Mrs. Clinton “stated she never deleted, nor did she instruct anyone to delete, her emails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information.”     Mrs. Clinton also told the FBI that she didn’t know the meaning of the letter (C) denoting a classification marking that appeared on a small number of emails. She told the bureau that she believed it had to do with the alphabetical order of the paragraphs.      Similarly, Mrs. Clinton didn’t have a computer in her office at the State Department, the report said, and on several occasions she told the FBI she didn’t receive guidance on particular electronic-security issues.     In her interview with the FBI, Mrs. Clinton largely repeated the account she has told to the public since the story broke in 2015, including that nothing in the emails she sent or received raised any red flags, with her or her top staffers, due to sensitive content.      The FBI said Mrs. Clinton “did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an unclassified system. She relied on State officials to use their judgment when e-mailing her.”     Many of the FBI’s questions in the July interview with Mrs. Clinton involved a series of emails between American diplomats in Islamabad and their superiors in Washington about whether to support a drone strike in Pakistan.     The aides used coded language to discuss the drone program, which remains highly classified.      Mrs. Clinton told the bureau that she “never had a concern with how classified information pertaining to the drone program was handled” by her aides or her department.      The FBI closed the investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information earlier this year without recommending any charges. At the time, FBI Director James Comey made a public statement about his reasoning, saying that while Mrs. Clinton had been “extremely careless” in using a personal email server for all of her government business, no reasonable prosecutor would pursue charges in such a case.     The new information is unlikely to change many minds about Mrs. Clinton’s culpability in the email arrangement, especially because the FBI report said it “is not intended to address potential inconsistencies in, or the validity of, the information related.”     It’s not unusual for the FBI to release summary reports of interviews conducted during an investigation that has since been closed. Such records, known as “302” reports, can be made public in response to freedom-of-information requests, with classified information or other material exempt from disclosure redacted. The records might be shielded if it isn’t publicly known that the interview subject was under investigation or if the person was treated as a confidential source.     Records summarizing a closed investigation can be made public in some circumstances. Typically, those records would redact anything revealing what the FBI recommended on whether the case should be prosecuted.     —Jacob Gershman contributed to this article.
