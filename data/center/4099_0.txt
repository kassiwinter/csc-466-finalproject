Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that,” they said.Conway said Trump agrees with the Warmbiers and "holds North Korea responsible for Otto Warmbier’s death.”“This president is responsible for having Otto Warmbier returned to this country and be reunited with his family in his final hours," Conway told Fox News. “What the president is talking about [is] that Chairman Kim did not know what happened to Otto at the time of when it happened,” she added. White House seems to be doubling down on President Trump's comments re: Otto Warmbier/Kim Jong Un...Kelly Anne Conway: "What the President is saying is that there is no indication Chairman Kim knew what happened to Otto Warmbier when it happened." pic.twitter.com/rRiPiL1lm3— Ellison Barber (@ellisonbarber) March 1, 2019A number of U.S. lawmakers have criticized Trump's comments, saying he should not have accepted Kim's denial of involvement in Warmbier's death.Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, was arrested in 2016 for stealing a propaganda poster in North Korea. He was returned to the U.S. in 2017 in a comatose state and later died at the age of 22. “He tells me he didn’t know about it, and I take him at his word,” Trump said of Kim at a Thursday press conference.
