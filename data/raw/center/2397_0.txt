         CLEVELAND—         Ivanka Trump    delivered a strong endorsement of her father,      Donald Trump,        as he prepared to formally accept the Republican nomination on Thursday, marking a stark departure from the angry rhetoric that punctuated the first three days of the Republican convention.     Ms. Trump’s address was uplifting and inclusive in tone. She made no mention of         Hillary Clinton,    her father’s Democratic rival, and focused her speech almost exclusively on praising Mr. Trump as a father and a businessman.      “For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people’s champion, and tonight he is the people’s nominee,” she said to a cheering audience. “I have seen him fight for his family, I have seen him fight for his employees, I have seen him fight for his company, and now I am seeing him fight for our country.”     Ms. Trump, a senior executive in the Trump real-estate empire and founder of her own fashion line, praised her father as the “single most qualified person” to be president and promised the audience he would be “your greatest, your truest and your most loyal champion.”               Her decision not to mention Mrs. Clinton was particularly notable following three days of speeches that have prompted delegates to shout “Lock her up! Lock her up!” about Mrs. Clinton. They shouted, “Guilty!” during New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s Tuesday speech, which he framed as an indictment of her record as the nation’s top diplomat.

Ms. Trump, the mother of three children, said her father has run a colorblind business that was a welcoming environment for women and mothers.     “When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort and excellence,” she said. “This has long been the philosophy of the Trump Organization. … Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother she is supported, not shut out.”     Yet some of the policy proposals Ms. Trump ascribed to her father are ones that Mr. Trump rarely touts on the campaign trail. She suggested her father would back equal pay for women—a proposal Democrats have long sought to put into law but Republicans have resisted.     Mr. Trump said last year that men and women deserve “equal pay for equal work,” but at a New Hampshire event last fall, he told a member of the audience: “You’re going to make the same if you do as good a job.” A Boston Globe analysis earlier this year found that the Trump campaign paid men on his staff one-third more than women, while Mrs. Clinton’s campaign paid men and women equally.     “Politicians talk about wage equality but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career,” Ms. Trump said. “He will fight for equal pay for equal work.”     Ms. Trump also reached out to young voters and independents, describing herself as a millennial who doesn’t identify as a Democrat or a Republican. And she described acts of kindness and compassion by a candidate who has pushed the boundaries of acceptable political combat.     “I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people he had never met who were facing some injustice or hardship,” she said. After he invited them to his office, they left “feeling that life could be great again.”     —Beth Reinhard      contributed to this article.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
