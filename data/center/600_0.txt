The Chronicle quoted DeBartolo as describing his experience in court as a “little piece of hell” and adding, “I am just very grateful we’re in the position we are now.” During the trial, DeBartolo said that during a meeting in a hotel restaurant in 1997, Governor Edwards slid a piece of paper with “400,000” written on it. DeBartolo said that the governor then told him, “This has to be taken care of by next week or there is going to be a serious problem with your license.” DeBartolo responded by saying, “I’ll take care of it.” DeBartolo said of Edwards, “The man could do as much harm as he could do good. That’s a threat if you read between the lines.”Later, when DeBartolo handed the money over to Edwards inside of deli close to San Francisco International Airport, the 49ers owner asked how the money would be gotten through airport security. DeBartolo said the governor lifted up his shirt to reveal a money belt around his chest. READ NEXT: Teenage Porn Star Controversy Rocks California High School
