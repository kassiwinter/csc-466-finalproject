                                                                                                                                         Conservative radio commentator Glenn Beck and liberal Hollywood movie-maker Michael Moore have found common ground on the National Security Agency whistleblower, Edward Snowden: He’s a hero.                                                                                                                                                      Both took to Twitter to opine on their favorable impressions of the information leaker, Politico reported.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Beck’s tweet: “I think I have just read about the man for which I have waited. Earmarks of a real hero.” Mr. Beck also tweeted: “The NSA patriot leader is just another chance for America to regain her moral compass and set things right. No red or blue. Just truth.”                                                                                                                                                         And Mr. Moore’s: “Hero of the Year #EdwardSnowden NSA tech assistant reveals he is the source of stories on U.S. Gov’t domestic spying.”
