A Texas grand jury looking into alleged misconduct by Planned Parenthood Federation of America cleared the group and instead indicted two antiabortion activists who made covert videos of the organization.The grand jury in Harris County, which includes Houston, on Monday indicted David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt on felony charges of tampering with a governmental record, according to Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson. It also indicted Mr. Daleiden on a charge of prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs, a misdemeanor, said Ms. Anderson, a Republican. The felony charge carries a possible maximum 20-year prison sentence, while the misdemeanor charge carries a sentence of up to a year.     According to the indictments, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, the felony charges are related to Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt using fake California driver’s licenses “with the intent to defraud or harm another.”               The indictments, which were filed in Harris County Court, were perfunctory and didn’t disclose details of the case. But they included copies of the fake licenses Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt allegedly used to access Planned Parenthood, which list false names.        
Previously        The move represented a surprise twist in the case, which was spurred by undercover videos of Planned Parenthood made in April by Mr. Daleiden, founder of the antiabortion group the Center for Medical Progress, and Ms. Merritt.     Some of the videos posted online by activists showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing providing fetal tissue for medical research. They led to Republican investigations in Congress and an effort by the GOP to end federal funding of the organization. Planned Parenthood said in October it would stop accepting reimbursements for the cost of supplying fetal tissue for medical research.     Abortion opponents said the videos showed Planned Parenthood illegally profiting from fetal tissue and changing abortion procedures to obtain better specimens. The health group said it broke no laws, that the videos were edited to be misleading and that the clinics legally received money to cover the cost of procuring, storing and transporting tissue.     The district attorney’s office began investigating a Texas branch of Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast Inc., in August, after a call for a probe of the videos by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in July. The matter was investigated by the district attorney, Houston police and the Texas Rangers. The Harris County grand jury began hearing evidence around the end of November.     “We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,” said Ms. Anderson in a statement. “As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case.”              Philip Hilder,    a criminal defense attorney in Houston and former federal prosecutor, called the circumstances of the indictment “highly unusual.” He wasn't involved in the Planned Parenthood case.     Mr. Hilder said that the grand jury likely uncovered new evidence during the course of their investigation that not only led them to clear Planned Parenthood but to also determine that the activists’ actions amounted to a crime. “The grand jury started out looking at one entity and realized they were being used and turned the tables,” he said. “And that is what a grand jury is supposed to do. They are supposed to be an independent investigative body.”      Planned Parenthood praised the grand jury’s action. “These people broke the law to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood in order to advance their extreme antiabortion political agenda,” said Eric Ferrero, a Planned Parenthood Federation of America spokesman, in a statement.     The group this month filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Daleiden and others alleging they had engaged in an illegal conspiracy. In that lawsuit, Planned Parenthood alleged that the Center for Medical Progress violated a federal racketeering law by engaging in a pattern of criminal acts.     Planned Parenthood alleged that the activists used fake drivers’ licenses and attended private conferences, and signed nondisclosure agreements that they violated by making the videos. It claimed that members of the group set up a fake nonprofit organization to pose as officials who were seeking fetal tissue for medical research. At the time, the Center for Medical Progress said the lawsuit was frivolous and a last-ditch “move of desperation” and that they had done nothing more than to “tell the truth about Planned Parenthood’s lawless operations.”     The Center for Medical Progress said in a statement that it “uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades in exercising our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and of the press, and follows all applicable laws.” It added: “Planned Parenthood still cannot deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see.”         More U.S. News                The indictment comes at a significant moment for Planned Parenthood, as it launches an offensive against efforts to cut its funding and investigate its procedures. The backlash over the videos has been costly to the organization, as a number of states have ended Medicaid contracts with the provider, and several presidential candidates have waded into the resulting controversy.     Federal funding makes up the largest part of Planned Parenthood’s revenues. About $528 million, or 41% of Planned Parenthood’s revenue, comes from state, local and federal funds, its annual report states. And more than 70% of that is reimbursements for services under Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor.     Though the undercover videos had ignited GOP outrage in Congress, in the face of Democratic opposition in the Senate and White House, GOP leaders more recently steered lawmakers away from seeking to defund the group in must-pass spending legislation, instead forming an oversight panel to investigate the women’s health group.     Some Democrats said the indictment should lead GOP members to halt their investigation.     “House Republicans should admit when they’re wrong,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.), the top Democrat on the oversight panel. “Their relentless and baseless efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and their select investigative panel must stop.”      Republicans said they would continue to look into Planned Parenthood’s practices.     “It is a sad day in America when those who harvest the body parts of aborted babies escape consequences for their actions, while the courageous truth-tellers who expose their misdeeds are handed down a politically motivated indictment instead,” said Rep. Diane Black (R., Tenn.).     Antiabortion activists said that criticism of the videos’ methods was a sign of their persecution for delivering an important message.      “It’s horrifying that the Houston grand jury failed to indict the organization who was willing to sell baby body parts yet somehow manages to indict the journalist who caught them in the act,” said         Kristan Hawkins,    president of Students for Life of America.     Officials in 11 states—Kansas, Florida, Ohio, Washington, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and South Dakota—have cleared Planned Parenthood of allegations that it profited from fetal tissue donation, according to the organization.      Mr. Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement Texas authorities including the state’s attorney general’s office continue probing whether Planned Parenthood broke any laws. “Nothing about today’s announcement in Harris County impacts the state’s ongoing investigation,” he said in a statement.     —Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
