Washington - President Trump has a job opening in his Cabinet after Health Secretary Tom Price resigned. Price angered Trump after his costly travel aboard private jets triggered an investigation. Trump called Price a “very fine person,” but added, “I certainly don’t like the optics.” Even though total travel cost could amount to hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars Price only offered to repay $51,887.31. Price’s office first stated his busy schedule forced him to use charters but changed its tune following his bosses criticism of the expensive travel. Now the Commander-in-Chief must appoint a new HHS secretary. The position oversees a $1 trillion department that has 80,000 workers. It’s responsible for overseeing advanced medical research, disease prevention, drug and food safety, insurance programs and public health. The HHS secretary also has to work in a bipartisan way to repeal Obamacare, something Price fell short in accomplishing. In the meantime, Trump named Don Wright, deputy assistant secretary of health, to serve as acting secretary.
