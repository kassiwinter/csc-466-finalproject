                                                                                                                                         As New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie looks to find his footing in the 2016 GOP presidential field, his supporters have launched a super PAC that can raise unlimited amounts of money to boost a possible bid and Mr. Christie’s leadership PAC is bringing on three veterans of President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign.                                                                                                                                                      The America Leads committee was registered on Feb. 23, according to a filing with the federal election commission.                                                                                                                                                      “He’s provided effective, conservative leadership in a deep blue state, bringing people together to solve difficult problems and get results,” said the group’s executive director, Phil Cox, according to the AP. “That’s the kind of leadership we need in America today, and we hope he decides to run.”                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Cox was executive director of the Republican Governors Association when Mr. Christie served as chairman.                                                                                                                              Mr. Christie is currently sixth in Real Clear Politics’ latest average of public polling on the possible 2016 GOP field, and a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 57 percent of Republican voters said they would not consider voting for him for president.                                                                                                                                                                 At last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Christie dismissed his critics and said there’s a long way to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Is the election next week?” he said. “If I decide to run for president, I’m not worried about what polls say 21 months before we’re going to elect the president of the United States.”                                                                                                                   The Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday that Mr. Christie’s Leadership Matters for America committee, which has stricter fundraising limits, is bringing on a trio of advisers who have experience on President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign: Brian Jones, Cary Evans, and Kevin Shuvalov.
