WASHINGTON—Nearly four dozen Democrats joined House Republicans to pass legislation Thursday that would halt the resettlement of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the U.S. and overhaul the screening process, delivering a rebuke to the White House in response to public anxiety sparked by last Friday’s Islamic State attacks in Paris.President Barack Obama, who threatened to veto the legislation, and many Democrats have argued that barring Syrian and Iraqi refugees would be contrary to American values and a strategic blunder in the effort to combat the spread of Islamic State ideology. The White House left open the possibility of agreement on different legislation—for which there was early bipartisan support—that would block other ways terrorists might be able to infiltrate the U.S.                                         Syrian refugees face long waits getting to the U.S., and new data show Mexican immigration to the U.S. is now a net negative. But both remain emotional political issues, potentially clouding the policy debate.

The defection of 47 House Democratssuggested that Mr. Obama’s initial visceral response wasn’t sufficient to unify Democrats on national security, with voters feeling more vulnerable on that front heading into the elections.               In early public comments, Mr. Obama focused on the contrast between his philosophy and that of Republicans, some of whom suggested the U.S. take in only Christian, not Muslim, refugees. He said that those ideas were “shameful” and un-American and that halting the program would anger potential sympathizers with Islamic State and push them toward radicalization.     But as the House took up its bill Thursday, Mr. Obama and his administration concentrated more directly on the policy reasons for opposing it.                                         Presidential candidates weigh in on the growing debate over how the U.S. should deal with Syrian refugees. Here's where they stand on the issue.

And the idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn’t jibe with reality.”      White House officials on Thursday said security measures in the waiver program have already been enhanced, but expressed an openness to working with Congress on the issue.      Thursday’s vote exposed tension between lawmakers’ desire to take steps to bolster national security and the administration’s philosophical and policy objections to a bill that officials said would also be impossible to implement.     The legislation would make the Federal Bureau of Investigation the primary agency in conducting background checks to certify that any incoming refugee isn’t a national-security threat. That process is now largely run by the Department of Homeland Security, though it works with other agencies, including the FBI.     It also would require the Homeland Security secretary, the FBI director and the Director of National Intelligence to personally sign off that each refugee isn’t a security threat.     Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director         James Comey,    in a rare joint news conference, said the measure was unworkable.     “To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt, would essentially not provide the safety and security that I think really is the concern of everyone looking at this issue,’’ Ms. Lynch said.      Republicans said a pause in the administration’s plan to resettle Syrian refugees in the U.S. was a warranted response to the Paris attacks, given national-security concerns.     Senate prospects are unclear for the bill, which passed the House 289-137. Senate consideration wouldn’t come until after Thanksgiving.

It is very much a long shot for Syrian refugees to get to the United States—only a small percentage of applicants are considered, and it can take up to three years to go through an intensive vetting process. Here are the stages migrants have to go through.                                                                                                     In the meantime, there was potential bipartisan interest in exploring other ways to guard against terrorist attacks.     “This is bigger than just refugees,” House Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) told a reporters Thursday, citing a visa waiver program and “homegrown jihadists” as other issues that merited inspection.     The visa waiver program, which is available to residents of 38 other countries, allows foreigners to enter the U.S. for as long as 90 days without obtaining a visa, avoiding an in-person interview at an embassy or consulate.      Senate Democrats are developing legislation to tighten the program, including barring anyone who has traveled to Syria or Iraq within the last five years from coming to the U.S. under the program. Some Senate Republicans, including Jeff Flake of Arizona, also support making changes.     Still, the fight is unlikely to end soon, given Republicans’ success in dividing House Democrats.     The battle over the refugee program was fueled by the fact that one of the suspects in the Paris attacks posed as a Syrian refugee when he entered Europe. Mr. Obama has committed to accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, in response to the wave of people fleeing war and the rise of Islamic State.     Democratic supporters of the refugee bill said the messy debate showed the shortcomings of the administration’s response to the GOP attacks launched swiftly after the Paris killings.     Rep. Gerald Connolly (D., Va.), an influential foreign policy voice, said more Democrats had warmed to the legislation because the administration hadn’t given them “a compelling reason to vote no,” after a last-minute meeting Thursday morning on Capitol Hill with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary         Jeh Johnson.         Opponents said the bill focused on the wrong channel for preventing terrorist acts from Islamic State militants, also known as ISIS or ISIL.     “If we want to add to security, we need to focus on where the problem is: airports and homegrown radicals—not with women and children fleeing ISIS,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The bill’s bipartisan support shows that “people are responding not to facts, but to the fears of what happened in Paris,” he said.     Minute details of the refugee screening process aren’t divulged by U.S. authorities. But all potential refugees are fingerprinted, photographed and interviewed by federal officials abroad. Biometric data is run through federal databases to confirm identity and check for criminal and other nefarious activity.
