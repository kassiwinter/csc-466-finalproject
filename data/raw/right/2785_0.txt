President Trump implied that there are recordings of conversations he had with former FBI Director James Comey.On Twitter Friday morning, the president wrote: “James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017 (Photo: Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images) Trump’s remark comes just hours after The New York Times published an account of a dinner he had with Comey a week after he was sworn in in January. According to the report, Trump asked Comey to pledge his loyalty to him, but Comey refused, saying “he would always be honest with him, but that he was not ‘reliable’ in the conventional political sense.” “Mr. Comey again replied that he would give him ‘honesty’ and did not pledge his loyalty, according to the account of the conversation,” the Times reported. The story noted that the White House disputed the account, saying it was not accurate. “Mr. Trump, in an interview on Thursday with NBC, described a far different dinner conversation with Mr. Comey in which the director asked to have the meeting and the question of loyalty never came up,” the Times notes. “It was not clear whether he was talking about the same meal, but they are believed to have had only one dinner together.” Trump fired Comey Tuesday night. Though the White House said his decision to do so came after two letters of recommendation from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the president contradicted that Thursday night when he told NBC News “it was set up a while ago.”
