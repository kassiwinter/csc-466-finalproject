                  Liz Cheney's    decision to abandon her rocky bid for a U.S. Senate seat triggered a mix of relief and disappointment among Wyoming Republicans, who will now be spared an intraparty feud.                                                 Liz Cheney speaks during a campaign appearance in Casper, Wyo. in July 2013.          Associated Press                                                                                                             The move, announced Monday, curtailed a primary battle that the elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney had launched in July to unseat three-term Republican incumbent Sen.         Mike Enzi.    By taking on a fellow Republican, Ms. Cheney had stirred anger within the party and divisions among conservatives in Wyoming, making the state an unexpected point of interest in this year's midterm elections.      "People are still waking up to the shock," said Marti Halverson, the state's Republican national committeewoman, who hadn't taken sides in the fight. "A good primary battle would have been interesting and important."     In a statement, Ms. Cheney cited unspecified family health concerns to explain her decision to quit the race.                "Serious health issues have recently arisen in our family," Ms. Cheney said in a Facebook posting. "My children and their futures were the motivation for our campaign, and their health and well-being will always be my overriding priority."                                                 Liz Cheney, shown last summer, trailed in the polls by a wide margin.

She boasted of endorsements from conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.           Washington WireEarlier           But her campaign suffered frequent stumbles. Polls showed her trailing Mr. Enzi by wide margins, and two of Wyoming's most prominent Republicans, Sen. John Barrasso and former Sen. Alan Simpson, immediately sided with Mr. Enzi, a well-liked, if soft-spoken, senator.     "This will certainly make it easier to re-elect our senator," said the state's national GOP committeeman, Greg Schaefer, who hadn't endorsed either candidate. He described Ms. Cheney's campaign strategy as "all about trying to pass judgment on Sen. Enzi's personality style."     A longtime resident of Virginia who moved to Wyoming in 2012, Ms. Cheney portrayed herself as retaining deep personal roots in the state, which her father had represented in Congress. The local press reported in August that she had incorrectly claimed to be a 10-year resident of the state when requesting a fishing license, an infraction that drew a $220 fine.      Her decision to drop out was first reported by CNN.     Her campaign fueled divisions within her family. After she expressed her opposition to gay marriage in November, her gay sister, Mary, accused her of being "on the wrong side of history."     Her parents then stepped in to defend Liz, saying in a statement that she "has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage."     Her departure all but guarantees an easy re-election for Mr. Enzi in one of the most Republican states in the country. In a statement, the Wyoming Republican Party suggested that Ms. Cheney wasn't likely to disappear from state politics.     "Liz is a rising star in Wyoming and national politics, and we look forward to her return when the time is right for her and for her family," the party said.
