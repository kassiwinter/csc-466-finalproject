WASHINGTON—The         Obama    administration wants to release some convicts before they have served their full prison sentences, as part of a broader push to cut sentences now widely seen as too harsh and save money by locking up fewer nonviolent drug offenders.         James Cole,    the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, urged federal inmates who meet a set of criteria outlined Wednesday to apply for clemency. Officials said early release will be considered for inmates who have served at least 10 years in prison, are low-level offenders, would have received a substantially lower prison term if sentenced under today's laws, don't have a significant criminal history and have no history of violence before or since incarceration.     The administration has long had the tools to grant early release but hasn't made it a priority. During more than five years in the White House, President Barack Obama has pardoned or granted clemency to fewer inmates than any other president—a total of 61 individuals.          The Justice Department's pardon office already has a backlog of thousands of early-release requests, and Mr. Cole said the office is staffing up to process those and the thousands of new requests it expects to receive. With the announcement, department officials expect to grant early release to hundreds of additional inmates. Such a review will take months, if not years; authorities didn't offer a timeline of when they expect to complete it.               The political push to release some inmates early—and reduce prison sentences in new cases—has been building for years. In conservative states like Texas, authorities have released inmates early partly to relieve pressure on their budget. The federal government has a similar motivation, because the cost of housing about 219,000 federal inmates eats up a growing percentage of the Justice Department's budget.     Some criticized the department's move, saying the criteria announced Wednesday had been in place for years but hadn't been used to release more than a small number of prisoners.      "I don't see anything here that's new or different,'' said         Samuel Morison,    a private attorney who worked for more than 10 years in the pardon office. "What would be new or different would be if they actually start granting clemency to people with logical consistency."     Historically, Mr. Morison argued, the Justice Department's pardon office worked more to protect its institutional interest—keeping people locked up—than helping grant pardons or clemency.     Advocates for sentencing reform and early release praised the administration's move as potentially historic. "I don't think we've ever seen anything like this on this scale," said         Mary Price    of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. "We've got a lot of people serving ridiculously long sentences."     The Obama administration is also seeking to rewrite some sentencing laws to reduce prison terms for nonviolent offenders. In an internal memo issued last year, Attorney General         Eric Holder    instructed prosecutors to avoid filing charges that come with long mandatory minimum sentences unless they feel the defendant deserves such a sentence.     Rep.         Bob Goodlatte    (R., Va.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the decision would endanger American communities by effectively rewriting laws, which is the job of Congress. The president, he said, "has again demonstrated his blatant disregard for our nation's laws and our system of checks and balances embedded in the U.S. Constitution."     The explosion in the U.S. prisoner population traces back to the 1980s, when public fears about rising crime and the crack-cocaine epidemic ushered in an era of strict sentencing guidelines, harsher penalties for selling crack than powdered cocaine, and mandatory minimums for certain crimes.     Officials said most of those likely to receive clemency would be defendants convicted of crack-cocaine charges, but didn't rule out other types of offenders, such as white-collar convicts or those convicted of certain types of gun-related crimes for which sentencing rules have changed.     "Older, stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today's laws erode people's confidence in our criminal-justice system,'' Mr. Cole said. "We are dedicating significant resources to ensure that all potentially eligible petitions are reviewed and then processed quickly to ensure timely justice."     Yet a day before the announcement, a separate branch of the Justice Department released new statistics pointing to the political and public-safety pitfalls of releasing inmates early. According to a Justice Department study of prisoners in 30 state prison systems, three out of four inmates released from prison are re-arrested within five years.
