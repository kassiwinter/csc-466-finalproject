                 | December 28, 2020 12:05 PM                There's a story in the New York Times this week that everyone should read in order to get a full grasp of how out of control and scary the race-baiting monsters of the so-called "Social Justice movement" can be.      The article, headlined, "Slur, Surfacing on Old Video, Alters Young Lives and a Town," tells the tale of a white high school student in Virginia who saw her future as an athlete at a major university go up in smoke after one of her peers, who is biracial, shared online a years-old video of the first student casually using the N-word.            Jimmy Galligan, the black student, chillingly says at the very end of the story, "I’m going to remind myself, you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”      The New York Times frames the depressing affair in the context of our never-ending nightmare that the media have dubbed a "racial reckoning," when really it's about the havoc caused by "social justice" advocates who intimidate and harass innocent people while claiming the moral high ground.      Mimi Groves, the white student, had sent a three-second video to a friend on Snapchat, wherein Groves, after getting her learner's permit, is seen saying, "I can drive," followed by the N-word.       The video was recorded in 2016, when Groves was a high school freshman. It wasn't until three years later, when both Groves and Galligan were seniors and Groves herself was calling for racial justice for black people, that Galligan received the clip from a friend.      "He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right," the New York Times said. It wasn't until after protests for the death of George Floyd were underway that Galligan decided it was time to blow up Groves's dreams of attending the University of Tennessee, which had sent her an acceptance letter and granted her a spot on the school's cheerleading team.      "Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon," the story said. "Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer."      The university, in response, removed Groves from the cheer team and told her she should reconsider enrolling. She withdrew her acceptance and ended up attending an online community college.      The incident, the New York Times said, revealed a "complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule."      Nonsense. Galligan wasn't ridiculed by Groves. He wasn't the intended recipient of the video, which he didn't even see until three years after it was recorded.      Galligan's intentions were rotten, as was revealed in the story when he describes how he confronted his father, who is white, after he had used the N-word. "A few years ago, he said his father said it aloud," the New York Times said, "prompting Mr. Galligan and his sister to quietly take him aside and explain that it was unacceptable, even when joking around."      Why couldn't Galligan have done the exact same thing for Groves? That question is also answered in the story by a black student who had defended Groves during the uproar. "We’re supposed to educate people,” she wrote on a social media post, “not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.”      That's what "social justice" advocates do — tear people down in order to feel morally superior. It's sick.      In the story, Groves is exceedingly embarrassed and apologetic for the video she sent on Snapchat. But what she did in private was not even nearly as offensive as what Galligan did to her in public.
