Justice         Ruth Bader Ginsburg,    a pioneering figure in the fight for women’s legal equality and the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, died Friday in her Washington home, surrounded by her family. She succumbed to metastatic pancreatic cancer at the age of 87, the Supreme Court said. “Our Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,” said Chief Justice         John Roberts.    “Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her—a tireless and resolute champion of justice.” Former President Clinton, who nominated her in 1993, said: “Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s life and landmark opinions moved us closer to a more perfect union. And her powerful dissents reminded us that we walk away from our Constitution’s promise at our peril.”     Cast by seniority to lead the high court’s liberal bloc, Justice Ginsburg spent her last years on the bench pushing back against an emboldened conservative majority, sometimes winning surprise victories or mitigating expected defeats by peeling off a vote from conservatives including Chief Justice Roberts and Justices         Anthony Kennedy,         Neil Gorsuch    or         Brett Kavanaugh.                   But it was more often a period of defeat for the liberal jurisprudence that shaped Justice Ginsburg, who attended law school and began practice during the ambitious era of the Warren Court. She then helped steer the high court as a women’s rights advocate in the 1970s. In recent years, she spoke most forcefully in dissent, sometimes reading from the bench, from decisions she viewed as antithetical to the social progress she believed the Constitution embraced.

Seib and Jess Bravin.                                                                                                     “The genius of this Constitution is that, over the course of now more than two centuries, ‘We the people’ has become more and more inclusive,” she said in a 2014 interview with The Wall Street Journal. “So it includes people whose ancestors were held in human bondage. It includes Native Americans, who were not part of ‘We the people,’” when the charter was ratified, she added.     “And, at last in 1920, half the population, women,” were brought within the polity through the 19th Amendment, she said.     In recent years, her health became a growing concern for her supporters, especially after the bitterly contested confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 cemented the court’s conservative majority under President         Trump.    Late that year, Justice Ginsburg underwent a surgical procedure to remove two cancerous growths on her left lung, which were discovered after a fall that left her with cracked ribs. Last year, she completed a three-week course of radiation treatment for a malignant tumor on her pancreas.     Beyond her jurisprudence, the slight, bespectacled Justice Ginsburg became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon in her later years, with blogs and movies portraying her as a hero of women’s rights and liberal principles at a time when many liberal activists saw those ideas as under attack.     Her face appeared on T-shirts and handbags, often with the nickname “Notorious R.B.G.,” a mashup of her initials and the late rap star Notorious B.I.G. She was featured in a documentary, and the 2018 feature “On the Basis of Sex” focused on her early career. She was celebrated in a comic opera that cast her against Justice         Antonin Scalia,    “Scalia/Ginsburg.” Her daughter-in-law, opera singer Patrice Michaels, wrote a series of songs recounting episodes in her life.        
The Death of RBG        She also developed specialties in areas far beyond civil liberties. Justice Ginsburg was the court’s most aggressive defender of copyright, for example, an interest she said she adopted from her daughter, Jane, herself an expert in intellectual property at Columbia Law School.     And Justice Ginsburg sometimes bridged the ideological divide with conservative Justice Scalia, a fellow opera aficionado with whom she developed a surprising friendship, despite their pronounced ideological differences that dated from their years together on a lower court. The two became stalwart proponents of a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers and of state juries’ power to impose punitive damages on wrongdoers.          Like other justices, Justice Ginsburg grew an extended family through the law clerks she selected. When former clerks had children, she typically sent them infant sized T-shirts welcoming her new “grandclerk.”      Former law clerk Goodwin Liu, now a justice of the California Supreme Court, said his mentor’s passing left him devastated. “Her acumen, grace, and fundamental decency shone through in everything she did,” Justice Liu said. “Her trailblazing career is an inspiration to people of every background across the country and throughout the world.”      Former clerk Elizabeth Magill recalled the justice’s idiosyncrasies, “her halting conversational style, her birdlike appetite, her dry humor, and her surprising love of Gilbert & Sullivan.” Justice Ginsburg was a night owl, and Ms. Magill, now a law professor and provost of the University of Virginia, said she once stayed up past 3:30 a.m. line editing an opinion with her.                                                 President Bill Clinton introduced Ruth Bader Ginsburg as his choice for the Supreme Court in 1993.

She leaves a towering legacy, and all who seek justice mourn her loss.”      “She was a warrior; she changed this country. And she did it, mostly, all by herself,” said Theodore Olson, the Republican lawyer who argued Bush v. Gore and later served as President Bush’s solicitor general. “We were very close, personally and professionally,” Mr. Olson said. “We have lost an irreplaceable voice and a person of indescribable vision and strength.”                                                  Justice Ginsburg, seen in her hometown of New York in 2010, had suffered ailments in recent years that concerned her supporters.

She accompanied him to Fort Sill, Okla., for his Army service, and then to Harvard Law School, where she was one of nine women in a class of about 500. When Mr. Ginsburg took a job in New York, she transferred to Columbia Law School to complete her degree.     Rejected for a clerkship with Justice         Felix Frankfurter    —she said because of her gender—Justice Ginsburg instead clerked for a district court judge and then became a law professor, first at Rutgers University and later at Columbia. She founded the women’s rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union and began developing test cases to challenge laws for sex discrimination, adopting         Thurgood Marshall’s    incremental strategy for fighting segregation.     To upend stereotypes, she often targeted laws that disadvantaged men or married couples, for instance, measures that made jury duty mandatory for men but not women, or imposed a higher drinking age on men. Using that strategy, she argued six cases before the Supreme Court, winning five.     In 1980, President         Carter    appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1993, President         Clinton    helped blunt a conservative ascendancy at the Supreme Court by selecting Justice Ginsburg to succeed Justice         Byron White,    a Kennedy appointee who had moved to the right during his tenure.     Justice Ginsburg wasn’t the first woman on the high court—she was preceded by Justice         Sandra Day O’Connor,    a 1981 Reagan appointee. But she was the first so closely identified with the women’s movement. The opinions she was most proud of vindicated women’s rights.     In 1996, she wrote a decision forcing the public Virginia Military Institute to admit women, over the sole dissent of Justice Scalia. Dissenting in 2007 from a decision sharply limiting the ability to sue employers for sex discrimination, she called on Congress to correct the majority by amending the law, which it did in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.     “I remain an ardent feminist, and I try to call people’s attention to the sometimes unconscious bias or thoughtlessness” about gender stereotypes, she told the Journal in 2014.                                         President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden comment on the death of Justice Ginsburg.

In 2016, she called then-candidate      Donald Trump        a “faker” and told the New York Times, “I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.” She later issued a statement calling that statement “ill-advised.”     Justice Ginsburg suffered several health problems during her tenure, including two bouts of cancer, and the loss of her husband in 2010. But she resisted calls for her to retire so that President Obama could appoint a like-minded, presumably younger successor.     As the liberal justice with the greatest seniority, she shaped—if not most decisions—at least the opposition.     “The dissent is trying to make clear the error into which the court has fallen,” she told the Journal in 2014. “The whole point of the dissent is that in the fullness of time, the dissent will become the prevailing doctrine. And that has happened throughout the history of this court.”     Former law clerk Phil Weiser, the Colorado attorney general, said, “Justice Ginsburg changed my life, teaching me about equal justice under the law and what outstanding legal work looks like—an important lifelong lesson. For millions around the world, her memory will continue to be a blessing.”                                                 Mourners gather outside the Supreme Court on Friday night following news of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death.

That, he said, “adds further meaning to a time that calls out for healing and renewal.”      The justice often cited her Jewish upbringing as shaping her sense of the law; the entrance to her chambers was decorated with a Hebrew quotation from Deuteronomy 16:20—”Tzedek tzedek tirdof,” or “Justice, justice you shall pursue.”      She leaves a daughter, Jane Ginsburg, a law professor at Columbia, and a son, James, a music producer in Chicago, and several grandchildren.
