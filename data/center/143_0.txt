HONG KONG—Police fired blue dye from water cannons and volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters besieging Hong Kong’s government headquarters, as tens of thousands took to the streets in defiance of a ban on antigovernment demonstrations.Violence flared late Saturday afternoon after crowds occupied major roads in processions that stretched for miles through the city. In several districts, people of all ages held umbrellas in drizzling rain, chanting for freedom, as social unrest stretched into a 13th weekend. By about 5:30 p.m., police fired multiple volleys of tear gas to disperse the crowds outside the government headquarters, followed by jets of water from water cannons—some with blue dye to stain protesters. Protesters, many clad in head-to-toe black, with helmets, gas masks and shields, tossed rounds back at police and flashed laser beams in response. Some threw tear-gas canisters into the complex that serves as the Hong Kong headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army, which is next to the Hong Kong government building. Others hurled Molotov cocktails toward the government building.                                                 Police fired tear gas at protesters in Hong Kong Saturday.

Protesters cheered and applauded as the fire burned, chanting “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times.” Firefighters later arrived to extinguish the blaze. China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency was quick to report on the fire, calling it “arson attacks by rioters in Hong Kong.”               A cat-and-mouse game ensued between authorities and demonstrators, with protesters retreating from major streets but regrouping in other neighborhoods. By 10 p.m., police had secured several streets and appeared to have made some arrests.      Police said two of their officers fired warning shots into the air near Victoria Park after being surrounded by protesters who they said tried to grab their pistols. It was the second straight weekend in which police felt compelled to fire a warning shot in the city.     As the night went on, pockets of protesters traveled to different districts via the city’s subway system. Police officers entered at least two subway stations, chasing protesters to make arrests and entering train cars. Live video footage from local media showed a team of black-clad police, members of an elite squad known as the Raptors, entering a train carriage and beating people. Near midnight, protesters and police faced off in the busy nightlife district of Mong Kok.      The protests took place a day after police arrested at least eight pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in a crackdown on the opposition movement. Police banned a mass rally planned for Saturday by a group that has organized the summer’s biggest peaceful protests, citing the risk of violence. The group canceled the rally, but many people turned out anyway, voicing disgust at the government.      What emerged Saturday was a movement in two parts: Protesters who come out and march peacefully, chanting their demands and risking arrest to voice their opinions; and a smaller group who choose more radical methods of protest.      “We’re not afraid of the consequences whatever they might be. We can’t be cowards anymore. We are Hong Kong and Hong Kong is not afraid,” said Victor Chu, a 25-year-old clerk.     The original march had been planned to coincide with the fifth anniversary of a decision by Beijing authorities that helped kick off the 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which protesters occupied roads in the heart of Hong Kong for 79 days. Organizers had planned to march west from the central business district to China’s liaison office, a symbol of Beijing’s presence in Hong Kong where protesters in July defaced the national emblem with ink.     In the early afternoon, the subway station nearest to the liaison office was closed, along with shops and restaurants in the area. Police blocked off some streets and guarded the building with plastic barricades.     Some protesters began to make their way toward the liaison office around 4 p.m., but most decided the danger of arrest was too high and dispersed to different neighborhoods: thousands to government headquarters, and others to the shopping district of Causeway Bay.      At the Legislative Council building, protesters hurled at least half a dozen Molotov cocktails, most of them igniting just behind large white barriers that surround the compound. In one case, a protester was set alight by one of them, and fellow protesters rushed ahead to douse the flames.     A few neighborhoods down from where police fired tear gas, thousands of protesters took over both sides of a two-way road surrounded by high-end shops, glitzy signboards and advertisements. As they marched they occasionally chanted in English, “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” as some shoppers and people appearing to be tourists filmed the crowd with their phones.

Mr. Wong said he had been marching with other protesters for five hours.     “There are no human rights in China so we don’t like these rule changes,” said Mr. Wong, referring to a controversial extradition bill that had triggered the protest movement. “If China doesn’t give freedom for Hong Kong, this movement will be endless,” he said.     The former British colony has been in the grips of a burgeoning political crisis after discontent over the bill that would have allowed extradition to China snowballed into a wider social movement.      Exactly five years ago, China unveiled a proposal that would have allowed for the city’s chief executive to be chosen by popular vote—but only from among candidates selected by a 1,200-member nominating committee that is dominated by pro-Beijing members. The proposal was rejected by the city’s legislature as it was seen by some lawmakers as not offering genuine democracy.     “We feel at this moment we have just one goal, which is a free Hong Kong,” said Shawn Chan, 54, who works in information technology. “Even though it’s illegal, it’s righteous for all Hong Kong people. It’s almost the last hope for us.”     Clad in a black shirt and a white face mask among crowds gathered on Hong Kong’s Queen’s Road Central, Mr. Chan said he was worried about arrest, but he said it was more important to demonstrate. “All of us worry but we have no choice,” he said. “We don’t know what happens tomorrow. Everybody who cares about Hong Kong has to be here.”                                         What started off as a demonstration against a controversial extradition bill has become a series of massive protests with broad political demands. Here is why so many Hong Kongers keep taking to the streets in a leaderless movement and whether their goals can be achieved.
