Thursday night's Democratic debate in New Hampshire was the clearest illustration yet of how the party's presidential race is now defined: It is a battle between a doer and a dreamer. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the doer. She stressed her experience, her desire to set achievable goals and her ability to work the system successfully to achieve them. There are limits to what can be done, she seemed to be saying, and it is better to work all the way to those limits rather than play Don Quixote, tilting at windmills, and ultimately fail.     Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do," she said. "A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do."     Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) is the dreamer. If the system sets limits, he argued, don't accept the limits, but instead smash the system. Wage a political "revolution"--a word he uses without reservation, and repeatedly--for government-guaranteed health care for all, for free college education, for a giant leap in the minimum wage.          And he has a simple unifying theory of why this all hasn't happened already: a "corrupt" campaign-finance system that allows corporate interests who would lose in a changed world stand in the way. Change campaign finance and all becomes possible.     What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors," he said. "When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America."     The sheer simplicity of the Sanders message is what gives it its greatest appeal to frustrated older voters and idealistic younger ones. Yet it also was clear Thursday night that the simplicity of it also is what exasperates Mrs. Clinton.     She described herself more as a battle-scarred veteran who has learned the hard way that it is best to do the work within the real world without, as she said, "making promises that I cannot keep." So her goal is to make college more affordable, not to promise that it can be free. She wants to expand and improve the health-care law known as Obamacare, not toss it aside in pursuit of some dubious goal of Medicare for all.     At one point she argued that she has the ability to work together with Republicans and independents to achieve such things: "We'll get things done together."     Mr. Sanders said his approach wouldn't be to negotiate compromise with, say, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell but rather to bring an army of citizens to his doorstep to make him to accept their demands.     No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell," he said. "Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, 'Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.'"     The Sanders approach seemed to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive during the first part of the debate. But the tables turned later, when the discussion turned to national security, as she painted his approach as not idealistic but rather dangerously naive.     That area is, of course, where she is, as the nation's former top foreign-policy Cabinet officer, the more nimble candidate. So she argued, for example, that it is a mistake to suppose, as Mr. Sanders has suggested, that it would be acceptable to invite Iranian troops into Syria to help police put an end to the civil war there, or to fully normalize relations with Iran more broadly.     "If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior," she said. Better to "take this step by step to try to rein in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us."     On that front, she got Mr. Sanders to argue that he, too, could be realistic, and that he was talking of normalizing relations eventually, not immediately.     Overall, though, Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire and beyond have two quite different approaches to choose between: a candidate who stresses achievement and one who prefers aspirations.
