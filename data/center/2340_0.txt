      Donald Trump        and         Hillary Clinton    plunged into general-election combat on Friday, and immediately showed voters the starkly different choices they represent in their views of abortion, women’s issues and the Supreme Court’s future.Speaking in Washington, D.C., to core political constituencies at almost the same time, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton tried to energize their supporters with a fearsome vision of what would happen if their opponent wins the presidential election in the fall. The Republican Mr. Trump, speaking to a conference of evangelical conservatives, warned that Mrs. Clinton would “appoint radical judges” to the Supreme Court—the top concern for many of the antiabortion activists in the audience.     “She will push for federal funding for abortion on demand,” he said at a conference organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an influential group of religious conservatives.               Mrs. Clinton, delivering her first campaign speech since wrapping up the Democratic contest this week, warned that abortion rights and other women’s priorities would be imperiled under a Trump presidency.

Mr. Trump cleared his field of rivals a month ago, whereas Mrs. Clinton conducted a two-front battle until this week against the New York businessman and her primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.     The dueling events underscore how a central issue for mobilizing voters in both parties will be concern about the future composition of the Supreme Court, which has been short one member since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year.     President         Barack Obama    has nominated         Merrick Garland,    a U.S. appeals court judge, to succeed Justice Scalia. Republicans have said they won’t hold a vote to confirm him, because they believe the next president should fill the vacancy that could shift the court toward a progressive stance or restore its previous conservative majority. Democrats say that the GOP refusal to act is politically motivated obstructionism.                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Trump spoke to the evangelical group as part of a broader effort to win over a sometimes-wary core constituency that is important to GOP grass-roots mobilization.     Although Mr. Trump, the thrice-married billionaire who used to support abortion rights, isn’t a natural fit for many social conservatives, he gained leverage from the fact that many in the audience cared more than anything about who will pick the next justices on the Supreme Court.     “It’s down to two choices now, and he has to be our choice,” said Debbie Lawrence, a 64-year-old from Arkansas. “I’m not going to be on his campaign, but I will encourage conservative evangelicals to vote for him, even if we’re not sure he’s in the same camp with us.”     In his speech, Mr. Trump pointed to what was perhaps his most important step of his campaign toward easing concerns on the religious right: the list he released last month of judges with conservative credentials whom he would consider for the vacancy on the Supreme Court.     “By the way, these judges are all pro-life,” he said.     Mr. Trump made no mention of the controversy that has been dogging his campaign for weeks, the allegations of racism in response to his claim that the federal judge overseeing litigation about Trump University cannot be impartial because of the judge’s Mexican heritage.     Mr. Trump read his speech almost entirely from a teleprompter—the latest sign that he is taking seriously Republicans who have urged him to rein in his freewheeling speaking style.     It remains to be seen how restrained he will be when he appears at one of his signature campaign rallies of screaming supporters. But at this event in a hotel ballroom, he stuck to his prepared text for an audience of evangelical leaders.     “We will restore faith to its proper mantle in society,” Mr. Trump said. “We will respect and defend Christian Americans."         More on Election 2016                For Mrs. Clinton, opening her face-off with Mr. Trump at a Planned Parenthood event drew attention to her historic status as the first female nominee of a major party.     The speech is part of a concerted effort by Mrs. Clinton and her campaign to rally support among women, where she enjoys an advantage, and in particular to win over Republican-leaning, suburban women who might otherwise not support a Democrat for president.     The former secretary of state and New York senator pointed to past comments where Mr. Trump insulted women as “‘ pigs,’ ‘dogs’ and ‘disgusting animals’ ” and called pregnant women an “inconvenience” for employers.     “Donald assures us as president he will be ‘the best’ for women,” she said. “Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe and legal abortion has no idea what’s best for women. It’s kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights.”     Her remarks were a full-throated endorsement for her host, Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack from Republicans in Washington and many state capitals, because it is the nation’s largest abortion provider, though most of its services are for other women’s health issues. About a dozen states have cut funding for the organization.                                         The long-expected endorsement by President Barack Obama of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton finally came Thursday. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains how his official backing could shift the presidential campaign.

Many women associate Planned Parenthood with contraception, not abortion, and many have personally used its services at one time.     “I’ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back,” Mrs. Clinton said.     In pointing to the importance of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Clinton noted that a Texas law imposing strict requirements on abortion providers is now under review. She also criticized Mr. Trump’s comments, later retracted, that women who have abortions should be penalized.     “Anyone who would so casually agree to the idea of punishing women … that is someone who doesn’t hold women in high regard,” she said. “Because if he did, he’d trust women to make the right decisions for ourselves.”     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
