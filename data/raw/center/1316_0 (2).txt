A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was holding for a second day Wednesday in advance of talks in Egypt on a long-term truce and a more comprehensive deal on the Gaza Strip. Many of Gaza's 1.8 million people ventured into the streets in search of food, medical supplies and other staples, taking advantage of the 72-hour pause in Israeli shelling and airstrikes. Others who had been living in shelters returned after a month of war to their homes or what was left of them. They foraged through the rubble to salvage what they could. Some wandered through their neighborhoods, surveying the damage.     "We don't want any more war," said         Umm Mohammed Ja'al,    an elderly woman from Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood who said 20 men from her family had been killed. "We want the killing to stop. We lost our houses. There were many casualties, a crazy death toll."           
Related           The lull also offered an opportunity to bury the dead. A procession of fighters from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad carried the body of one of their slain fighters from Al Shifa Hospital down a major Gaza avenue to a cemetery, and fired off bursts of automatic weapons in salute.                The truce is the longest pause in fighting that has so far killed 1,875 Palestinians and 67 Israelis, including three civilians, since the war started on July 8, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials. Officials are hopeful it can set the groundwork for talks on a lasting peace.     Security arrangements and trade access to the Gaza Strip are expected to be issues at the core of the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt. Egyptian officials are to mediate the talks, with assistance from U.S. diplomats.     Israel aims to ensure Hamas cannot rebuild its rocket arsenal and military capabilities, while Hamas wants the Israeli blockade of goods and people into Gaza lifted.                                                 An Israeli tank moves at an unspecified location near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, as a 72-hour truce held for a second day.          European Pressphoto Agency                                                                                                             At the center of these deliberations, according to U.S., Israeli and Arab diplomats, is a push to place the Palestinian Authority led by         Mahmoud Abbas    and Egypt at the heart of efforts to disarm Hamas and open Gaza to economic development.     These diplomats said the Palestinian Authority might be given the task of manning Gaza's border crossings with both Egypt and Israel, which will be needed to smooth the flow of humanitarian aid.     Ending a seven-year Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza is one of Hamas's central demands for any deal. But it was unclear whether Hamas would resist the push to give Mr. Abbas a larger role in Gaza. The Palestinian president is also the head of the Fatah political faction, Hamas's chief rival.     The latest major military confrontation between Israel and Hamas—the third in less than six years—erupted when the Israeli military began bombarding targets in Gaza in an attempt to stop Hamas and other armed Palestinian factions from launching rockets and mortars at Israel.     On July 17, Israel sent ground troops into the seaside enclave to destroy underground tunnels it said Hamas had constructed for attacks inside Israel.     Tensions were already high before the war broke out, following the June killings of three Israeli teenagers, whose bodies were discovered two weeks after they disappeared in the West Bank.     Israel accused Hamas of being behind the kidnappings, and subsequently carried out a massive police manhunt in the West Bank, arresting hundreds of Hamas members.     Israeli authorities said in a court document released Tuesday that they had arrested         Hussam Qawasmeh,    a member of Hamas who officials say helped organize the June 12 abductions. The July 11 arrest marks the first individual Israel has taken into custody for alleged direct involvement in the killing.               Labib Habib,    a lawyer representing Qawasmeh's family, declined to comment on the murder case, except to say that Mr. Qawasmeh's wife was unaware of the allegations. A spokesperson for Israel's Shin Bet security agency declined to comment because of a gag order.     Israeli security authorities have not located two other Palestinians they accuse of actually carrying out the abduction.     In early July, an Arab teenager was abducted and burned alive by Israeli extremists in apparent retaliation for deaths of the Israeli teens. Six Jewish Israelis were arrested in connection with that killing.     Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com and Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
