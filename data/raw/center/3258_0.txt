President      Donald Trump        said Tuesday he is moving to impose new regulations that would ban devices that allow certain firearms to function as rapid fire “machine guns,” in the wake of the mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead.Mr. Trump, speaking at an event in the White House, said he had signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop regulations that would ban the sale and use of “bump stocks.” While that accessory wasn’t used in last week’s Florida shooting, it was used in the Las Vegas gun massacre in October that stands as the deadliest in U.S. history. In a statement, the Justice Department said it grasps that “this is a priority for the president and [it] has acted quickly to move through the rule-making process. We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”     The deadly shooting last Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., thrust gun laws back into the spotlight. A 19-year-old former student there admitted to killing 17 students and school employees. He was armed with an AR-15 style rifle, according to a complaint affidavit released Thursday.                                         Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims.                                                                                                     Following the shooting, Mr. Trump is facing renewed pressure to take action that would safeguard the nation’s schools, with students around the country staging demonstrations and urging stricter gun-control measures. Although he was a staunch supporter of gun rights during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump is signaling a new openness toward gun restrictions amid a string of mass shootings.          The president is hosting two days of meetings at the White House this week with students, parents, teachers and public officials aimed at improving school safety. The White House said Tuesday that those meetings would include people from Parkland, as well as from two other major school shooting sites, Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and Columbine High School in Colorado.     White House press secretary         Sarah Huckabee Sanders    told reporters that Mr. Trump hasn’t “closed the door” on a potential ban of assault-style weapons.     After Ms. Sanders’s briefing, though, a White House official said Mr. Trump’s position is unchanged in that he doesn’t support a ban on assault-style weapons. Mr. Trump wants to keep an open mind ahead of the discussions with parents and students this week, but isn’t bending in his support for Second Amendment rights, the official said.     What Mr. Trump would consider, alternatively, is an age restriction that keeps certain weapons away from people under 21; trained armed guards in more schools; tougher background checks; and more screening to keep guns away from those with mental illness.              Sen. Dianne Feinstein    (D., Calif.) said that only legislation can ban bump stocks, and that “the ATF currently lacks authority” to do so. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials have repeatedly said the devices aren’t subject to federal firearms statutes, Ms. Feinstein said. She warned that the matter “could be tied up in court for years” if the ATF moves forward with a ban.                                         Bump stocks, legal gun accessories found in the suspected Las Vegas shooter's hotel room, make semi-automatic weapons simulate machine guns.

After the Las Vegas massacre, the NRA said it supported having the ATF, an agency within the Justice Department, evaluate how bump stocks work with an eye toward whether they essentially convert some guns into federally banned automatic weapons.     Mr. Trump’s approach to assault-style guns has changed over the years. In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” he wrote: “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.”     In that same book, he characterized the stances of the parties in extreme ways, writing that Democrats wanted to “confiscate” all guns, and that “Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.”     But in his book “Crippled America,” published 15 years later, Mr. Trump echoed points made by gun-rights activists. “Opponents of gun rights often use a lot of scary descriptive phrases when proposing legislative action against various types of weapons. Ban ‘assault weapons’ they say, or ‘military-style weapons,’ or ‘high-capacity magazines,’ ” he wrote. He went on to describe those guns as “common, popular semiautomatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned and used by tens of millions of Americans.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Mr. Trump courted and received the NRA’s endorsement in the 2016 presidential race. The group went on to spend $30 million on ads attacking Mr. Trump’s opponent         Hillary Clinton    and supporting Mr. Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That’s more than the group spent on all federal races in the previous two election cycles, when the group fiercely opposed President         Barack Obama,    FEC records show.     Concluding a speech last April in at the NRA’s leadership forum in Atlanta, Mr. Trump said: “I can proudly say, I will never, ever let you down.”     The NRA won’t comment on the bump stock move “until an actual rule is published with specifics that we can review,” NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in a statement.     “The NRA’s stance on this issue has not changed. Fully-automatic weapons have been heavily regulated since the 1930s,” she said. “But banning semi-automatic firearms and accessories has been shown time and again to not prevent criminal activity and simply punishes the law-abiding for the criminal acts of others.”     Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Julie Bykowicz at julie.bykowicz@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
