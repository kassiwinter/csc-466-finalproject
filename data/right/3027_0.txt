                 | October 05, 2017 04:13 PM                 Rep. Tim Murphy resigned his seat in Congress Thursday, days after court documents revealed the conservative Republican urged a mistress to obtain an abortion.        His departure was announced by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who told reporters at a press conference in Maryland's Eastern Shore "it's appropriate he moves on to the next chapter of his life and I think he agrees with that."        Murphy, R-Pa., announced this week he would not run for re-election in the state's 18th district, a seat he has held since 2003.        "This afternoon I received a letter of resignation from Congressman Tim Murphy, effective October 21," Ryan said in a statement. "It was Dr. Murphy's decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it. We thank him for his many years of tireless work on mental health issues here in Congress and his service to the country as a naval reserve officer."
