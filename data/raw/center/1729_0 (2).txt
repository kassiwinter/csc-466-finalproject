PARIS—         Andreas Lubitz     was alone in the cockpit, breathing in silence, as his captain pounded on a locked door and passengers screamed. Those chilling sounds—captured in a black-box recording—have left French investigators with little doubt that the crash that killed 150 people aboard Flight 9525 was deliberate.Lead prosecutor         Brice Robin    said on Thursday he suspected Mr. Lubitz, the 27-year-old Germanwings co-pilot, locked the captain out of the cockpit, programmed the A320’s descent and slammed it into an alpine ridge at 400 miles an hour with a “willingness to destroy this aircraft.” That fatal sequence raises fresh concerns about a danger that aviation and security regulators consider among the least controllable: the threat posed by insiders. Following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, authorities world-wide added layers of screening to stop passengers, crew or staff from carrying weapons or dangerous materials onto airplanes. But those measures have left aviation insiders with ample opportunities to sabotage flights.      In the first of what could be a series of security changes in the wake of Tuesday’s crash, European aviation regulators on Thursday took steps to require that two crew members be in the cockpit at all times during flights, as is required in the U.S.                At least 12 plane crashes in the past four decades are suspected to have been deliberately caused by pilots or others at the controls, according to the Aviation Safety Network, a group that tracks air incidents. That doesn’t include terrorism, such as the 9/11 attacks.     Investigators suspect that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared a year ago on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, was deliberately diverted by someone at the controls. No wreckage has been found, but a strong circumstantial case has been presented for a scenario involving a piloted diversion and crash in the Indian Ocean.     U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told an aviation-security conference in October that the danger of “malicious insiders working in the industry is even scarier” than the threat from potential suicide attacks on planes with explosives.     The crash of Flight 9525 appears to have been the latest instance of that nightmare scenario, one that Germanwings and parent Deutsche Lufthansa AG were straining to grasp.

The executive noted that Lufthansa, which boasts a world-class safety record, took pride in “being extremely picky in choosing its pilots.”     The turn of events also knocked European investigators off balance.      French officials scrambled to explain the co-pilot’s apparent role to victims’ next-of-kin as hundreds of them arrived in Southern France to pay tribute. Mr. Lubitz’s family was kept apart from other relatives, who were rushed to a briefing with Mr. Robin.     The families, mostly hailing from Spain and Germany, were transported in eight buses from Marseille under heavy security. French police strictly kept journalists away from the families.           “This is a day they heard a lot of truth,” said French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet.      Even though they were devastated, the relatives reacted with courage and dignity, he said.     Police escorted Mr. Lubitz’s family to Seyne, the alpine town closest to the inaccessible crash site, saying it was too soon to question them for clues as to what might have driven the co-pilot to destroy the plane.      “They’re here to mourn. It’s not the right moment,” one investigator said.     In Germany, authorities searched the home of Mr. Lubitz’s parents in the Western German town of Montabaur as investigators delved into the co-pilot’s background.      Mr. Robin and German officials said there was no evidence Mr. Lubitz, a quiet, 27-year old German who had a passion for gliders and competitive running, acted as part of a terrorism plot.     The co-pilot joined Germanwings in 2013 and since then logged 630 hours of flight time, according to Lufthansa. The German airline’s training of the pilot was temporarily interrupted for several months for reasons that remain unclear, Mr. Spohr said.     Asked whether Mr. Lubitz had committed an act of suicide, Mr. Robin responded: “I don’t call it a suicide when you have 150 people behind you.”     Mr. Robin drew upon the 30-minute recording, extracted from a black box recovered from the crash site Tuesday, to portray two sides of Mr. Lubitz—a man who exchanged pleasantries at the start of the flight before becoming walled off in silence.

The younger pilot showed no interest in the crucial procedure, Mr. Robin said, responding tersely to his captain.     “You would expect more of a dialogue to occur and not only short answers,” the prosecutor said.     After reaching a cruising altitude, the captain is heard asking Mr. Lubitz to take over the controls, Mr. Robin said, adding the recording captured the sound of the captain’s chair sliding backward as he left the cockpit.      Mr. Spohr described the handoff as a “classic situation” of a captain stepping out to go to the bathroom once a plane levels off. Unlike airlines operating in the U.S., Lufthansa and many other European carriers haven’t required a second person to be present in the cockpit at all times.      Alone at the controls, Mr. Lubitz entered instructions into the plane’s flight system, changing the altitude setting from 38,000 feet to 100 feet—the minimal setting. About nine seconds later, according to the plane-tracking website Flightradar24, the plane began to descend.      Air-traffic control made multiple attempts to contact the cockpit in the next 10 minutes. The crew was instructed to send out a distress signal.      In the absence of any response, the controllers then asked other aircraft in the area to radio the plane. Flight 9525 remained silent.     With the plane markedly in descent, the captain can be heard knocking on the cockpit door. That sound swelled into frantic banging as the plane neared alpine peaks, setting off audible alarms.     “The most plausible interpretation for us is that the co-pilot deliberately refused to open the cockpit door to the captain,” Mr. Robin said.     Amid the cacophony, Mr. Lubitz remained silent, the prosecutor said. The only sound coming from the co-pilot, Mr. Robin said, was his breathing. The prosecutor marveled at how it didn’t waver as the A320 entered the final stages of its collision course.      “He didn’t say a single word,” Mr. Robin said, adding: “It’s not the breathing of someone who is having a heart attack.”     By then, people in the passenger cabins began to realize the plane was in peril, the prosecutor said.     “We hear their screams only at the very last moment,” he said.     Corrections & Amplifications     Flight 9525’s co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 27 years old. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he was 28, based on erroneous information initially provided by the LSC Westerwald flying club.
