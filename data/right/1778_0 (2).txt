                                                                                                                                         Does the news media favor Hillary Clinton? Analysts bicker about it even as journalists scramble after the Democratic hopeful wherever she may be - though formal press conferences are a rarity in her campaign so far. A new poll, however, suggests that the press is at least very eager to cover Mrs. Clinton, and it’s having an impact: 66 percent of Americans now say they’ve heard “a lot” about Mrs. Clinton’s presidential intentions. Only 46 percent say they’ve heard a lot about the 2016 election itself - and far less have been up close and personal with the GOP presidential hopefuls. That percentage is in the 30s.                                                                                                                                                      Here are the numbers:                                                                                                                                                      66 percent of American say they have heard “a lot” about Hillary Clinton’s recent presidential announcement; 73 percent of Republicans, 61 percent of independents and 69 percent of Democrats agree.                                                                                                                                                                    46 percent overall say they’ve heard a lot about the 2016 presidential election; 52 percent of Republicans, 41 percent of independents and 48 percent of Democrats agree.                                                                                                                              38 percent overall have heard a lot about Sen.
