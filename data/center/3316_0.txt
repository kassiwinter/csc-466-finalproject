Law enforcement officials, who identified the suspect as 23-year-old         Mark Anthony Conditt,    said they traced him to a hotel in this Austin suburb, about 20 miles north of the city. In a confrontation early Wednesday with the police, the suspect detonated a device and died, Austin Police Chief         Brian Manley    said. Shots were fired during the encounter with police.                                                  Mark Anthony Conditt in an undated photo from a Facebook posting.

Officials said they hadn’t yet identified a motive, and they would be investigating whether any accomplices had helped the suspect. Earlier reports incorrectly said the suspect was 24 years old.               Authorities cautioned area residents to remain vigilant in case Mr. Conditt was able to send or place any more explosives in the past day.               Fred Milanowski,    the special agent in charge of Houston Field Division for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Wall Street Journal that investigators were able to identify the suspect in the Austin serial bomber case through basic police work.     “There were several small pieces that all came together,” he said Wednesday morning. “It was purchases. It was some video. It was witness statements that all came together.”           After the second bombing, on March 12, the ATF identified a “signature” in the explosive devices. “Forensically they were very similar,” Mr. Milanowski said. “Same explosive filler was used in all of them.” He added that all the devices that detonated appeared to be the work of a single bomb maker, with nails and screws as shrapnel.      A home address most recently associated with Mr. Conditt, according to records, was located on a dead-end street in the historic downtown of Pflugerville, a small town on the outskirts of Austin that has been absorbed by the sprawling suburbs.     It is a street grid of older homes. Law enforcement officers—Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and ATF agents—blocked off access to the house. Roosters crowed on the edge of downtown as the sun rose.     A couple of blocks from the home, a stream of cars drove by—early morning commuters on their way to work. Business owners were opening their stores.               Anthony Williams,    owner of the First the Blade Barber Shop, said he was surprised. Most of the people who live in the neighborhood, he said, are older residents who live here to be away from the bustle of nearby Austin. “I just wouldn’t figure it was anyone from out here,” he said, “But I guess he could come from anywhere.”     Police Chief Manley said authorities first identified the suspect as a person of interest about 24 hours to 36 hours ago. By late Tuesday night, he said authorities felt confident that the suspect was responsible for the bombings and tracked his vehicle to the parking lot of a hotel.                                                 Investigators closed down parts of a highway after the suspect in the serial bombings detonated an explosive in his car.

Police followed the vehicle but it stopped in a ditch nearby.      As members of the Austin SWAT team approached, the suspect detonated a bomb inside his vehicle, knocking one of the officers back, and another officer fired at the suspect, he said. Chief Manley said the suspect died during the exchange with police and suffered significant injuries from the blast.      “I couldn’t believe yesterday—a bomb here, a bomb there,” said         Mona Henson,    a Round Rock resident who works as a server at the IHOP off the portion of I-35 shut down by authorities. “I’m glad it’s over.”     She questioned who the bomber might be and whether she might have met him at some point. “You wonder, did I wait on him? Did I see him? Do I know this person?” she said.        
Related        The string of bombings started in early March and picked up pace in recent days. On Tuesday, law enforcement found two more explosive devices at FedEx Corp. facilities in Austin and outside of San Antonio.      Chief Manley said witnesses and “video sources” had helped them zero in on the suspect during the course of the investigation.      “We became very interested in him over the last couple days,” he said.      The investigation drew hundreds of law enforcement from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and ATF bureau.     The bombings began March 2, when a package explosion went off in northeast Austin, killing a 39-year-old man. A pair of package bombs detonated 10 days later in another neighborhood, leaving a 17-year-old dead and two other people wounded. On Sunday night, two men were seriously injured by an explosion in a wealthy enclave near the city limits.                                                 Officials investigate the scene where they say Mark Anthony Conditt blew himself up as authorities closed in on him in Round Rock, Texas.

But Sunday’s bombing was different, rigged with a tripwire, and police say the injured victims—two white men—appear to be random.     The area around hotel, where the suspect had parked his vehicle, buzzed with police activity early Wednesday as law enforcement pressed ahead with their investigation. Bleary eyed guests emerged from their rooms to find the area alit with flashing lights from police cars and other emergency vehicles. Word of what had happened quickly circulated among them.      The bomber was dead.     —Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.
