WASHINGTON—Members of Congress and some of their staff are about to get personal experience with the Affordable Care Act.The law says they will cease to be eligible for federal government employees' heath-insurance plan on Jan. 1. So starting Monday, lawmakers and their aides will be able to sign up for health insurance through a special section of an online marketplace being run by the District of Columbia. A provision of the Affordable Care Act says lawmakers and their aides must get coverage using the new health-insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, that were set up in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to serve people who can't get coverage through their employer or a government program. The rule doesn't affect staffers who work directly for congressional committees, or any other federal government employees.           Related           The idea came from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and was based on the notion that members of Congress, which passed the law, should have to experience the exchanges themselves. But many congressional staff feared it would effectively lead to a large pay cut. Congress, like most big employers, has traditionally paid a large portion of workers' premiums.                The solution devised by the White House's Office of Personnel Management, based on a suggestion from District of Columbia exchange officials, calls for lawmakers and staff to use a part of the District of Columbia marketplace designed for small businesses. There, they will be able to pick from a selection of the most generous small group plans on sale in the District, and continue to pay only around a quarter of the premium themselves.     The compromise hasn't satisfied everyone. Some Republicans, led by Sen.         David Vitter    of Louisiana, have pushed measures that would make members and staff ineligible for any subsidies toward the cost of coverage, including during negotiations to end the budget standoff last month.           
Find Your State's Health-Insurance Exchange                 Mr. Grassley, for his part, hasn't said whether he thinks the arrangements are in keeping with his original intention. Spokeswoman         Jill Gerber    said his amendment had been offered early in the debate around the law and that it was "conceptual."      The District, along with 14 states, is directly running its own exchange—called DC Health Link—rather than handing the task to the federal government. DC Health Link's board and staff include some health-policy notables: Its executive director,         Mila Kofman,    was Maine's insurance superintendent and earlier was a White House adviser. Brookings Institution health-policy scholar         Henry Aaron    is vice chairman of the board.     Lawmakers and thousands of their staffers in their congressional and district offices can reject the coverage offered through DC Health Link, but they would lose the government's insurance contribution and would still have to obtain health insurance on their own or face a penalty.     The District is taking a low-key approach to discussing the new arrivals. "We do look forward to serving their insurance needs," said exchange spokesman         Richard Sorian.         What members of Congress see when they go to the exchange is likely to feature in subsequent debates about the law, even if their experience isn't typical of small businesses or people buying coverage on their own. Individuals have to pay the cost of premiums themselves unless they have low enough incomes to qualify for federal subsidies.     Many of the state-run exchanges have fared better than the troubled federal HealthCare.gov site that houses the exchanges for 36 states. But the District's exchange has also had some stumbles since it opened Oct. 1. Most notably, people trying to apply for coverage through its marketplace for individuals weren't able to find out if they would be eligible for subsidies until Nov. 2.     Mr. Sorian said Friday that the small-business exchange was ready to go and "fully operational" for congressional enrollees coming to sign up on Monday. Members and staff have until Dec. 9 to enroll.     The House and Senate have picked 112 of the exchange's plans to be made available to lawmakers and staff considered to work directly for members, rather than committees. All the plans are considered "gold" level because they cover about 80% of medical costs. Because those plans are similar to the plans currently offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, congressional enrollees will likely be able to remain with their current doctors.     There are some other changes ahead, though. In the federal-worker plan, older congressional employees weren't charged higher premiums than younger colleagues. In the small-business market Congress is entering, premiums can vary somewhat based on age, although the health law restricts by how much. That means some lawmakers and staff in their 50s and 60s could pay more than they are used to. The District of Columbia, meanwhile, sets to benefit from an influx of additional members into its market, many of whom are relatively young and healthy.
