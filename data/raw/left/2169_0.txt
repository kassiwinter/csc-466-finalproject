His death quickly set off debate over a new nomination,                             with prominent Republicans calling for the next president to make a nomination. President Obama said                            he would nominate a new justice despite objections.                                                                                                                      	6:48 pm ET  Feb 13, 2016  2016-02-14T01:22:02+00:00                                                                                                                                                       Photo                                                                                                                            Judge Antonin Scalia in 1986.Credit Paul Hosefros/The New York Times                                                                                                                The death of Justice Antonin Scalia immediately shook up the 2016 presidential race, inserting a new issue for the candidates to use to draw contrasts with one another.                           Several candidates — three of whom are sitting senators — sent quick condolences and had already staked their ground on the question of what President Obama and the Senate should do about                             Justice Scalia’s replacement.                           Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who served as a clerk under William H. Rehnquist, called                             Justice Scalia “one of the greatest justices in history” and was the first to call for the Senate to wait until a new president was elected before confirming a new justice.                           “We owe it to him and the nation for the Senate to ensure that the next president names his replacement,” Mr. Cruz wrote on Twitter.                           Senator Marco Rubio of Florida echoed Mr. Cruz’s sentiment, saying the decision should be for “the next president.”                           “The next president must nominate a justice who will continue Justice Scalia’s unwavering belief in the founding principles that we hold dear,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement.                           Donald J. Trump, another Republican candidate, called for the Senate to “delay, delay, delay” if President Obama tried to nominate a successor.                           Other candidates did not immediately speak on the issue, and limited their reaction to condolences. Among them was Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, who said that                             while his beliefs “differed with Justice Scalia’s views and jurisprudence,” he saw the justice as “a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court.”
