         WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Friday freed a group of Roman Catholic nonprofit organizations from complying with the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive provisions while they pursue a challenge to the law before a federal appeals court.     The 2010 federal health-care law requires that plans include contraceptive coverage. Nonprofit employers that claim religious objections to contraception can opt out of paying for their employees to receive such benefits by filing a form with the Labor Department. Insurers generally must still provide employees the coverage, however, and in many cases can obtain reimbursement from the government.      In legal papers, Baltimore and Denver affiliates of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order, maintain that their beliefs bar them from filing that form because it "could still be construed...as authorizing provision of contraceptives."     Friday's order says the Little Sisters need not provide contraceptive benefits or authorize insurers to independently cover them if they "inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that they are nonprofit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services."               The order stands while the case is pending before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. The Supreme Court said its order shouldn't be interpreted as an expression of its views on the merits of the case.     Friday's order, which didn't indicate how the court voted, extends a temporary enforcement ban Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted the religious order on New Year's Eve, just before the provision took effect.     The order "means that the sisters are now protected from IRS fines while they litigate their case. We're very happy and grateful," said Mark Rienzi, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom who represents the nuns. He said he expected the case to be argued at the 10th Circuit by early summer.     A Justice Department spokeswoman said the injunction applied only to the plaintiffs, who she said have always been eligible for an exemption from the coverage requirement.      It is likely the Supreme Court eventually will be called upon to decide the issue. The court already has on its March calendar a suit that private, for-profit companies have filed contending that providing contraceptive benefits within employee health insurance violates the religious freedom of their owners.      The Obama administration maintains that for-profit companies cannot claim rights to religious exercise. It agrees that nonprofit religious organizations can, however, and last year devised the opt-out mechanism to last year to address their concerns.     The administration says its approach fully insulates the religious nonprofits from actions they find objectionable. Dozens of religious groups disagree, and have filed suits similar to that of the Little Sisters.     In addition to the Supreme Court, several lower courts have issued orders temporarily blocking enforcement of the mandate while litigation continues.      In Chicago, however, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month rejected the University of Notre Dame's bid to block enforcement of the contraception mandate.      A Notre Dame spokesman, Paul Browne, said its lawyers were examining their options in the wake of the order. "We're greatly encouraged by this ruling," he said.
