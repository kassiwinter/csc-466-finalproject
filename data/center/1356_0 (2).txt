Republican Gov.         Bobby Jindal    of Louisiana filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the Obama administration of illegally compelling states to adopt the Common Core education standards, a case that will elevate his national profile as he weighs a presidential bid. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, La., argues that the U.S. Department of Education illegally used federal grants to compel states to adhere to Common Core standards, taking authority over education policy that is reserved for states.                                                                                                                                Mr. Jindal, who had initially endorsed Common Core, said the administration action "hijacked and destroyed" the program by coercing states to adopt it.     "Common Core is the latest effort by big government disciples to strip away state rights and put Washington, D.C., in control of everything," he said.               The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the Department of Education from continuing to award grants based on the current conditions.         Dorie Nolt,    a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, didn't address the specifics in the lawsuit but defended education standards. "The most important thing is that children in Louisiana have gone back to school this year with high academic standards in place," she said Wednesday.     The standards provide learning benchmarks for English and mathematics, and were developed by governors and state education commissioners, among others. Some conservatives have criticized what they say is a one-size-fits-all approach.     This year, GOP governors in Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina moved to end Common Core in their states or replace it with different standards. Wisconsin GOP Gov.         Scott Walker    asked the state legislature to repeal Common Core next year.     Other Republican governors continue to back the standards, including Michigan Gov.         Rick Snyder,    who has said much of the opposition is based on the mistaken belief that the standards were written by the federal government.      Mr. Jindal, 43 years old, is in his second term as governor and is barred from seeking a third. He has said he is thinking about a White House candidacy.     GOP political consultant         Curt Anderson,    who advises Mr. Jindal, said the lawsuit wasn't politically motivated. "He would be doing this if he was planning to leave the country," he said. "It's just what he believes in."     By accusing the Obama administration of overreaching its authority, Mr. Jindal could boost his profile among Republican primary voters. "People don't like the federal government telling them what to do," said         Hans von Spakovsky,    a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. "Folks in the tea party very much think education should be a local concern, and they don't like the idea of the federal government forcing its national standards."      Potential GOP White House candidates "are trying to find the right edge among conservative rank-and-file primary voters and caucus attendees," said         John Weaver,    who advised Sen.         John McCain    during his 2008 presidential campaign. "For Gov. Jindal, I think he's going to try to hang his hat on this for a while."     In reversing course on Common Core, Mr. Jindal also draws a distinction with a prominent former governor with possible presidential aspirations:         Jeb Bush.    Mr. Bush, if he chooses to run in 2016, is perceived as vulnerable due to his support for legalizing undocumented immigrants and his embrace of Common Core.     "This is a way to become a darling of the tea party," said         Michael Petrilli,    president of the right-leaning education policy think tank Thomas B. Fordham Institute. "Bobby Jindal is not going to win these lawsuits, but he is going to win politically just by staging the fight." Legal experts say the suit is unlikely to succeed given that the federal grant programs in question are voluntary for states.     Mr. Jindal triggered a fight within his home state, and with the Louisiana Department of Education, when he issued an executive order in June seeking to withdraw the state from a consortium developing tests aligned to Common Core standards. A group of parents, teachers and a charter organization filed a lawsuit against Mr. Jindal for his action.     "The Common Core State Standards have been fundamental expectations in Louisiana for four years," said         Barry Landry,    a spokesman for the state education department, which supports the standards.
