WASHINGTON—Former Vice President      Joe Biden        opened his presidential campaign Thursday by pointing to a “battle for the soul of this nation,” in what may be the last major addition to a sprawling lineup of Democratic candidates competing to challenge President Trump in 2020.Mr. Biden’s entry means the Democratic contest is largely set, putting the former vice president into a scramble for the nomination against a diverse field of candidates who have been competing and raising money for months. The contest already is revolving around who is most likely to unseat Mr. Trump, with primary voters debating how far left a winning nominee might go. Mr. Biden made his long-awaited announcement in an online video, casting Mr. Trump’s comments praising “both sides” after the 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Va.—where hundreds of white nationalists staged a protest against the planned removal of a Confederate statue that led to street fighting and left one woman dead—as a national emergency that demanded a change in leadership.     “I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time,” Mr. Biden said in the video, posted nearly 32 years after he began his first presidential campaign in June 1987. “But if we give      Donald Trump        eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.”               After Mr. Biden’s announcement, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe,” and suggested he lacked the intelligence to win the primary.      Speaking with Fox News’         Sean Hannity    on Thursday night, Mr. Trump, referring to Mr. Biden’s comment about the country’s “soul,” said there had been “tremendous division” during the Obama administration and added: “We actually have great spirit right now.”      Mr. Biden enters the campaign with a reservoir of goodwill among Democrats after eight years as         Mr. Obama’s    vice president and 36 years of service as a U.S. senator from Delaware. Early polls have shown him as a leading contender for the nomination, helped by his broad name recognition.          Mr. Biden nonetheless will face a number of hurdles at the start of his campaign. His Democratic rivals have had a head start on fundraising for several months. His centrist Democratic politics—supportive of the Affordable Care Act and the Paris Agreement on climate change, for example—may not sit well with some liberal activists in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. These voters champion Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, a far-ranging effort to reshape the U.S. economy within 10 years to release net-zero carbon emissions.      Justice Democrats, an advocacy group that backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, said it would oppose Mr. Biden’s candidacy: “The old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump, and they can’t be counted on to lead the fight against his divide-and-conquer politics today.”     In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has faced allegations from seven women that he inappropriately touched them or made close contact. Mr. Biden, who is known for his tendency to touch people, didn’t apologize but said that he would be “more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space.”     If elected, Mr. Biden would be the oldest person to enter the White House. He is currently 76 years old, four years older than Mr. Trump and a year younger than Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.     On his first day, Mr. Biden picked up endorsements from a handful of senators, including Sens.         Tom Carper    and Chris Coons from his home state of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and         Doug Jones    of Alabama.      His supporters, meanwhile, sought to create a show of force in fundraising, mindful of Mr. Biden’s need for a strong start. “There’s been a huge amount of activity,” said         Steve Westly,    a former California state controller who is raising money for Mr. Biden’s campaign, though he provided no specifics. “Fundamentally, people believe in Joe Biden, and fundamentally, people believe the United States is in a very serious position and they need someone experienced for the job.”     Mr. Biden attended a private fundraiser in Philadelphia on Thursday that was organized by former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and several longtime supporters.     Mr. Biden is chasing rivals who have made headway in fundraising, particularly among donors who give in small amounts: Mr. Sanders has taken an early lead, amassing more than $18 million during the quarter ended in late March, while Sen. Kamala Harris of California collected more than $12 million and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas brought in $9.3 million.     Mr. Biden is slated to hold his first public campaign event Monday in Pittsburgh, where he plans to address union workers, followed by a trip to Iowa. After visiting Iowa, Mr. Biden plans to travel to South Carolina, Nevada, California and New Hampshire and then hold an event in Philadelphia on May 18.     His early schedule will include a number of fundraisers, including a May 8 event in Beverly Hills, Calif., at the home of designer Michael Smith and his husband, James Costos, who served as U.S. ambassador to Spain during Mr. Obama’s second term, according to an invitation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Co-hosts include former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, Hollywood mogul         Jeffrey Katzenberg,    director Rob Reiner and         Peter Chernin,    the former president and chief operating officer of News Corp, which is the Journal’s parent company.     In the months leading up to his announcement, Mr. Biden said he would run as an “Obama-Biden Democrat,” seeking to cast himself as a healing figure for a divided nation and restoring many of the Obama-era policies that have been reversed or challenged by Mr. Trump’s administration.     Mr. Obama isn’t expected to issue an endorsement of Mr. Biden, or any Democratic candidate, during the primaries. Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that the former president “has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. He relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today.”                                         Presidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows, but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains.                                                                                                     Mr. Biden spoke briefly to reporters at the Amtrak station named for him in Wilmington, Del., where he arrived from Washington, D.C., Thursday morning. The former vice president said that he had asked Mr. Obama not to endorse him, preferring to let the race develop without the former president’s early input.     As vice president, Mr. Biden often served as the administration’s emissary to working-class voters in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin—states that proved crucial to Mr. Trump’s triumph in the 2016 election. If Mr. Biden can win the Democratic nomination, he will compete for those blue-collar voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency.     In the primaries, the former Delaware senator will seek the nomination of a party that has embraced a more expansive government role in health care, education and the environment in recent years. Mr. Biden is also expected to face scrutiny of his lengthy record in Congress—including his handling of         Anita Hill’s    testimony concerning sexual-harassment allegations during the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. In addition, Mr. Biden’s support for the 1994 crime bill has been criticized by some African-Americans as contributing to the mass incarceration of members of black communities.     Mr. Biden has spoken to Ms. Hill and “he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country,” said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager. Ms. Hill didn’t respond to requests for comment, but in an interview Wednesday with the New York Times she said she wasn’t satisfied with what he said to her.
