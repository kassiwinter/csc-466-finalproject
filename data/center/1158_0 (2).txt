    By Thomas Catan and Carol E. Lee     WASHINGTON—Priorities USA Action, a deep-pocketed "super PAC" with close ties to President          Barack Obama    , has thrown its weight behind a possible presidential bid by         Hillary Clinton,    in a major symbolic move that could discourage rivals.      The group also named Mr. Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, as its co-chair, fueling speculation that the President was tacitly endorsing Mrs. Clinton over his own vice president,         Joe Biden.         "Having played a critical role in 2012, Priorities USA Action has very clearly demonstrated its ability to help elect a Democratic president," Mr. Messina said in a release announcing his new role. "We intend to replicate that role and its success again in 2016, defining a clear choice for the American public."          The move comes unusually early in the election cycle – a vote is nearly three years away -- and comes before any candidate has formally announced their intention to seek the presidency. Mrs. Clinton has said she is still considering whether to run.     If so, then the fact that she will be able to count on the support of one the richest and best-organized outside spending groups should be a powerful incentive to join the race.     Some Democratic operatives had been reluctant to throw their weight behind Mrs. Clinton this early in the process for fear of antagonizing other possible candidates. The move by a group so closely allied with Mr. Obama could be seen as a snub of the vice president's ambitions.     The decision by Priorities USA Action to formally align itself with Mrs. Clinton is the latest piece in what is shaping up to be a powerful fundraising and spending machine for the former first lady and secretary of state. Another independent spending group, called Ready for Hillary, recently surprised many political observers by announcing it had raised $4 million in 2013 to lure her into the race.     To avoid chasing the same donors, the two outside groups worked out a deal: Ready for Hillary seeks donations of less than $25,000, while Priorities USA Action can go after big donors.     The benefits of backing Mrs. Clinton could flow both ways. Being aligned with such a well-known figure may help Priorities USA Action raise money from Democratic donors, who might otherwise be reluctant to contribute to a still-faceless campaign.     It isn't clear if the super PAC will weigh-in at the Democratic primaries or wait until a presidential candidate is nominated. If a surprise rival were to snatch the nomination away from Mrs. Clinton, the group could presumably switch its allegiance to them.     So-called super PACs, created in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizen's United decision, can take in unlimited donations and runs ads for, or against, a candidate. But they aren't allowed to coordinate with a campaign.     Still, Priorities USA Action combines members of both the Clinton diaspora and Mr. Obama's inner circle, bolstering the impression that Mrs. Clinton is now the anointed candidate of the Democratic Party leadership.     On Thursday, the group announced a reshuffle of its board to prepare for its post-Obama role. It will include Harold Ickes, former President Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff. Buffy Wicks, who worked on Mr. Obama's reelection campaign and in his White House, was named executive director.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
