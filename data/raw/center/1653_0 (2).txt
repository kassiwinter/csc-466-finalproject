A gunman shouting ‘Allahu akbar’ targeted free-speech activists, policemen and Jews in a 14-hour rampage through Copenhagen this weekend, killing two men and wounding five people, in attacks that plunged another European capital into terror just over a month after the Paris shootings.The events in Copenhagen, which climaxed early Sunday when police shot dead a man they said they believe was behind the twin assaults on a cafe and a synagogue, renewed calls for European governments to accelerate the implementation of security measures long deemed as posing a risk to civil liberties. But Denmark authorities stood defiant as messages of support poured in from world capitals.     “We face some difficult days, when our unity will be tested,” Danish Prime Minister         Helle Thorning-Schmidt    said. “But in Denmark, we will never bow to violence.”               Danish police said the suspect was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark and who was known by authorities for several criminal offenses, notably related to the use and possession of firearms. A Danish radio station said the suspect had been released from prison a few weeks ago.          Denmark launched a nationwide manhunt Saturday after a man wearing a parka and a balaclava attacked a seminar on Islam and free speech organized in the wake of the January attack on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.     Police said the man sprayed dozens of gunshots through the plate-glass windows of central Copenhagen’s Krudttonden cafe, where Swedish cartoonist         Lars Vilks    —who has faced death threats for his caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad—was among those in attendance.     Mr. Vilks wasn’t injured, but a 55-year-old man died and three security officers were wounded.     Shortly after midnight, police reported another shooting, outside a synagogue in downtown Copenhagen, that killed a 37-year-old guard standing watch outside a bat mitzvah and wounded two police officers.     Using footage from surveillance cameras and information provided by witnesses, police said they were able to locate a suspect outside a train station in the northern part of Copenhagen. He was shot dead after he opened fire, police said.     Police later said they believed the same gunman was behind both attacks. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said there was no information to suggest the suspect, a Copenhagen resident, had traveled to war zones in Iraq or Syria. Police declined to release his identity, citing the continuing investigation.      “There are a number of things indicating we have the right perpetrator, but our technical investigation isn’t complete so we cannot be 100% sure,” said Jorgen Skov, head of the Copenhagen police. “There is nothing to suggest that several perpetrators are involved.”     Police said the motive for the shooting remained unclear, but that it was possible that Mr. Vilks was the target. The cartoonist achieved notoriety nearly a decade ago for trying to exhibit caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad as a dog.     Copenhagen was in lockdown on Sunday morning, with sirens and a helicopter breaking the silence in the usually quiet capital city. Police cordoned off the area around the synagogue, installing floodlights to allow investigators to search the crime scene.

Inna Shevchenko,    the Ukrainian feminist activist, had just taken the floor and was talking about one of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists killed in January when three or four gunshots rang out.

But the gunfire intensified and bullets began piercing through the windows, spreading panic inside the cafe. Curtains prevented participants from seeing their assailant but “we heard him shout ‘Allahu akbar,’ ” Ms. Kolek said. An audio recording obtained by the BBC captured the moment in which the shots were fired.     Mr. Vilks’s bodyguards worked to evacuate him, while police officers guarding the conference began shooting back at the gunman, Ms. Kolek said.     Like others in attendance, France’s ambassador to Denmark,         François Zimeray,    said he crawled on the floor toward a backdoor emergency exit. The ambassador tweeted that he “was still alive in the room” on Saturday, and thanked a police officer for saving his life.     Ms. Kolek said police and other witnesses later told her how the gunman—minutes before the shooting—had been seen trying to enter the cafe through the back door.

One person died and two were shot there, about 10 hours after another shooting in that city.

To flee the cafe, the suspect hijacked a car and abandoned it after a five-minute drive north of the attack, police said.      While police had initially said they were seeking two suspects in the cafe shooting, interviews with witnesses on the scene later led them to believe there was a sole perpetrator, police spokesman         Steen Hansen    said.

January’s terror spree in and around Paris began when two brothers stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, killing 11 people—including 10 staffers—there and another person outside in what one of the gunmen later said was retaliation for images the newspaper had earlier published of the Prophet Muhammad.     In response, Charlie Hebdo decided to print another caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in a “survivors” issue the following week. That, in turn, led to waves of anti-French protests that have swept parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.     While most of those protests were peaceful, some turned violent. In Niger, 10 people were killed, as rioters torched churches, wrecked bars and blocked several major roads during two days of demonstrations against Charlie Hebdo.                                                  Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, shown in 2010, was participating in an event in Copenhagen that was attacked by a gunman.

The controversial caricatures that the French newspaper first printed in 2006 were reprints of others that earlier had been printed by a Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, in what the newspaper said was a defense of free speech.     Most mainstream newspapers in Denmark reprinted some of Charlie Hebdo’s most contentious drawings after the attack, but Jyllands-Posten didn’t, citing concerns for its employees’ safety.     The Danish newspaper was the target of a foiled terrorist attack in 2010, when five men were arrested for planning to kill as many of the newspaper’s staff as possible. One of its most famous cartoonists,         Kurt Westergaard,    who penned a depiction of Muhammad wearing a bomb in his turban, was also targeted in a failed killing attempt at his home in 2010.                French President         François Hollande    deplored Saturday’s attack and expressed his solidarity with Denmark’s Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, his office said. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the site of the first attack on Sunday afternoon, saying that the European Union should quickly implement a long-debated system to track travelers entering and leaving the bloc by plane.     “We see the similarity to the events that happened in Paris,” Mr. Cazeneuve said during an impromptu news conference carried on live television. “Europe needs to give itself new means to fight terrorism together.”     At the Krudttønden cafe, Ms. Kolek said she persuaded participants to resume the conference for a moment after the deadly attack.     “I went on the stage and said: They are not just trying to kill us, they want to shut down freedom of speech.”     —Sam Schechner and David Gauthier-Villars in Paris contributed to this article.
