The call followed intelligence in the days before the 2020 election that revealed Beijing believed Trump was preparing to launch such an attack to manufacture an international crisis.Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Col. Dave Butler on Wednesday confirmed Milley made the calls but said they were routine. Butler added that the general “regularly communicates with Chiefs of Defense around the world, including China and Russia. These conversations remain vital to improving mutual understanding of U.S. national security interests, reducing tensions, providing clarity and avoiding unintended consequences or conflict.”Kirby also said such calls are “staffed, they're coordinated and they're transparent, as transparent as they can be.”Woodward and Costa also write that Milley was “certain that Trump had gone into a serious mental decline in the aftermath of the election” and then convened a secret meeting at the Pentagon to review military protocols, ordering senior military officials to not take orders from anyone unless he was involved.Kirby, without confirming the reporting in "Peril," said, "It is not uncommon at all, for the department to continue to review security protocols — particularly when it comes to our strategic deterrence capabilities — that we constantly take a look at the protocols and the procedures to make sure that they are still relevant."“It is completely appropriate for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as the senior military adviser to both the [Defense] secretary and the president, to want to see those protocols reviewed on whatever frequent basis that he wants to do that,” Kirby added.The pushback has done little to quash complaints about Milley.Sen.

Frank McKenzie are also set to appear at that hearing.Milley had already come under criticism from Trump and some other Republicans for comments defending critical race theory during a committee hearing over the summer.In the comments, Milley defended reading materials critical of the Founding Fathers, saying he thought it was “important, actually, for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read.” “I want to understand white rage, and I'm white,” Milley said at one point during the July House Armed Services Committee hearing.He also made it clear that the military does not actually teach critical race theory at West Point, but his comments were criticized by some on the right who saw it as offering support for what they see as a “woke” military. Milley himself had dismissed characterizations of “woke” officers as offensive.Fox News host Tucker CarlsonTucker CarlsonRight wing criticizes media for lack of coverage on Durham probe Putin doesn't fear NATO or Ukraine — he fears democracy Democrats accuse GOP of 'race-baiting' with court pick attacks MORE called Milley’s comments “pathetic” and “sad.”That skirmish had nothing to do with the excerpts in "Peril," but it created a context where critics of Milley were even more ready to call for his resignation.Some other Republicans have held back from calling for Milley’s ouster, including Sen.
