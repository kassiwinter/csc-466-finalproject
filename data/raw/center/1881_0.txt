FILE — The Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in downtown Portland.LC- The OregonianFederal officers on Thursday repeatedly drove demonstrators away from the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in downtown Portland in response to fires and damage to the building just hours after a security fence was removed.Dozens of demonstrators assembled near the courthouse Thursday night, and some of them broke glass at the federal building and lit fires, according to reports from the scene.A large contingent of federal officers responded by deploying impact munitions, tear gas, flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs, according to livestream videos from independent journalists and others documenting the demonstration.Officers drove protesters away from the courthouse in at least three distinct pushes. At least one person was detained.Demonstrators and officers remained squared off in front of the courthouse about 11:30 p.m. Authorities repeatedly said federal property, including the sidewalk surrounding the courthouse, was closed and that those who were on federal property were trespassing.Journalist Suzette Smith, a former Portland Mercury editor, reported the demonstration was a continuation of protest efforts from earlier in the day, when a group gathered in opposition to the replacement and expansion of an oil pipeline that would go from the Canadian province of Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin.Protesters say the new corridor would harm watersheds, wild rice lands and Anishinaabe treaty territories. They argue corporations should clean up an existing, old pipeline.Demonstrators also cited the recent dismantling of protections in front of the courthouse—a large security fence had been erected around the building last summer, but was taken down earlier Thursday—and proceedings in the case of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death as reasons they were protesting Thursday night, Smith reported.Workers put wooden boards on courthouse windows earlier in the day.—Jayati Ramakrishnan; 503-221-4320; jramakrishnan@oregonian.com; @JRamakrishnanORNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.
