Just take a look at         Twitter,    where Secretary of State John Kerry’s senior communications adviser Marie Harf is feuding with a reporter.     David Sanger, a national security reporter at the         New York Times,    wrote a story earlier this week saying the growth of Tehran’s nuclear stockpile in the past 18 months of negotiations partially undercuts the Obama administration’s claim that Iran’s program had been “frozen” in that period.      In a State Department briefing Tuesday, Ms. Harf said she and everyone at the State Department who read the story “was totally perplexed by it.” On Wednesday, Mr. Sanger on Twitter pointed Ms. Harf to a research group's report that informed his reporting. This kicked off a pretty epic Twitter stream from Ms. Harf, who is transitioning from her previous job as the State Department deputy spokeswoman.     * * *          First, Mr. Sanger's tweet......Which set off these responses from Ms. Harf:    Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
