WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Trump administration’s cancellation of an Obama-era program that provided legal protections and work permits to unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.The court, in a 5-4 opinion by Chief Justice         John Roberts,    said the administration acted arbitrarily when it moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, failing to offer adequate reasons for doing so. The ruling hands President Trump one of the biggest legal defeats of his presidency in the middle of an election year in which immigration is again a top political topic. The decision effectively provides relief to more than 600,000 DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, who have been in limbo since Mr. Trump in 2017 decided to wind down the program.     The court’s decision also highlighted the biggest legal stumbling block Mr. Trump has faced throughout his first term: While a new administration has wide latitude to change regulatory policies, federal law requires agencies to explain their decision-making to the public and offer sound reasons for adopting a new approach.                What Trump Has Done to Curb Immigration                                                                                                    Photo:              paul ratje/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                          President Trump has made restricting immigration a top priority. Here are some of his biggest actions.                                    The court said the Trump administration didn’t do that.               “The dispute before the Court is not whether [the Department of Homeland Security] may rescind DACA. All parties agree that it may. The dispute is instead primarily about the procedure the agency followed in doing so,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote, joined in full or part by liberal Justices         Ruth Bader Ginsburg,         Stephen Breyer,         Sonia Sotomayor    and         Elena Kagan.         He added that the decision didn’t address “whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,” which wasn’t the court’s concern. But the government failed its duty under the Administrative Procedure Act to “provide a reasoned explanation for its action,” including “what if anything to do about the hardship to DACA recipients.”     Last year, the court voided the administration’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census for similar reasons.     The decision served as the latest marker that Chief Justice Roberts controls the court’s direction following the retirement of maverick conservative Justice         Anthony Kennedy    in 2018. The chief’s alignment with the court’s liberal wing in 5-4 cases hasn’t happened often, but that coalition was likewise responsible for last year’s census ruling, as well as the court’s blockbuster 2012 decision that saved most of the Affordable Care Act.     Four conservatives dissented. Justice         Clarence Thomas,    joined by Justices         Samuel Alito    and         Neil Gorsuch,    wrote that DACA was illegal from the get-go because the Obama administration itself hadn’t followed ordinary rule-making procedures before establishing the program.     “Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct decision,” Justice Thomas wrote.     Justice         Brett Kavanaugh    wrote a separate dissent, arguing that the administration had cured any defects in the original decision to kill the program by subsequently offering additional reasons. He aimed his greatest critique, however, at Congress.     Lawmakers’ inability to address the status of young immigrants “has forced successive administrations to improvise, thereby triggering many rounds of relentless litigation with the prospect of more litigation to come,” he wrote.        
More Coverage        The president responded to the outcome in personal terms. “Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?” he tweeted. “These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives,” he said in another tweet.     DHS Acting Secretary         Chad Wolf    said DACA recipients deserved closure on their status, which the high court didn’t provide. “This ruling usurps the clear authority of the Executive Branch to end unlawful programs,” he said.     Administration officials gave no immediate indication of whether they would try again to cancel the program. If they do, they will have to offer new supporting reasons.     Democrats praised the decision and pledged to support efforts to give Dreamers permanent status. Democratic presidential candidate      Joe Biden        said he would send such a bill to Congress “on day one of my administration.”     “For over eight years, DACA has given hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who came to this country as children the chance to contribute to the country they know as home,” Mr. Biden said.              Martin Batalla Vidal,    29, the named plaintiff in one of the cases that reached the Supreme Court, said he had all but resigned himself to defeat. “In my mind, I was thinking, ‘Am I ready to go to a country I don’t even know?’” Mr. Vidal said, referring to Mexico, where he lived with his family until he was seven.     “I was just crying tears of relief,” he said of his reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision.      The high court’s ruling against the Trump administration stuck to narrow reasoning and rejected more sweeping legal claims that its policy had been motivated by hostility to Hispanics, who comprise the majority of DACA recipients. Justice Sotomayor, in a solo opinion, objected to that portion of the ruling and cited Mr. Trump’s statements disparaging immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally as enough evidence for courts to investigate that argument further.     Fighting “unlawful migration from Mexico” was “a keystone of President Trump’s campaign and a policy priority of his administration,” she wrote, and the president’s words could suggest the motivation for rescinding DACA was unconstitutional discrimination against an ethnic group.          Mr. Obama initiated the program in 2012. DACA provided protection from deportation and work permits for people who arrived in the U.S. before they turned 16 and satisfied other conditions, including being a student or graduate and having no significant criminal record. DACA recipients could seek renewals of their status every two years.     “Eight years ago this week, we protected young people who were raised as part of our American family from deportation,” Mr. Obama said on Twitter. “We may look different and come from everywhere, but what makes us American are our shared ideals.”     The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to implement several tough-on-immigration initiatives, at least temporarily, including restrictions on asylum seekers and rules that make it easier for the government to turn away limited-income immigrants because they might use public-assistance programs.     The president and other administration officials argued they had little choice but to cancel DACA because Congress hasn’t authorized any such policy. A separate Obama-initiated program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, would have protected millions of additional illegal immigrants from deportation, but the Supreme Court split 4-4 on that program in 2016 after the death of Justice         Antonin Scalia.    The deadlock effectively killed that Obama initiative.     Chief Justice Roberts said that even if the administration believed it was unlawful to provide benefits to DACA recipients, it still needed to grapple with the prior administration’s conclusion that forbearance for Dreamers was especially justified, given they came to the U.S. as children and know no other country.     After the cancellation ran into initial trouble in the courts, then-DHS Secretary         Kirstjen Nielsen    offered additional explanations, saying it was important to deter potential immigrants by demonstrating that neither they nor their children could expect leniency should they make it to U.S. soil.     The chief justice said that after-the-fact explanation wasn’t properly before the court.     An array of plaintiffs sued the Trump administration to challenge the DACA cancellation, including several states and municipalities, the University of California system, Princeton University,         Microsoft Corp.    , civil-rights groups and individual DACA recipients.     The White House and Congress have been unable to reach agreement on how to tackle the issue, or immigration policy more broadly. The cancellation of the program was scheduled to begin in March 2018, but lower courts issued rulings that blocked the administration from ending DACA.     Since then, the government has been accepting DACA renewal applications, but hasn’t taken new applications for the program.      The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, estimates that about 66,000 young unauthorized immigrants would have become newly eligible for the program had the administration continued accepting new applications.     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the government agency that administers the program, didn’t answer questions on Thursday about whether it would reopen the program to new applicants.     Immigration hard-liners immediately called on the administration to try once again to end the program, with a more thorough approach that meets legal requirements the Supreme Court spelled out.     “They fought this all the way through. I don’t see, politically, how they could not re-rescind DACA,” said         Mark Krikorian,    executive director of the Center for immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors lower levels of immigration.     Thursday’s decision lifts immediate pressure off Congress, where discussions had begun on a possible immigration package to grant permanent legal status to the young unauthorized immigrants in exchange for a range of immigration enforcement measures.     Similar deals have failed to pass both houses of Congress several times throughout the Trump administration, and most political observers viewed the latest talks, particularly so close to the coming election, with skepticism.        
A Brief History of DACADeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is a program launched by the Obama administration to give some legal protection to unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. It provides recipients a work permit and a two-year, renewable guarantee against deportation. To apply, among other criteria, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, the date the program was announced, and have come to the U.S. before they turned 16 and before June 2007.  June 2012: President Obama announces the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a Rose Garden ceremony. August 2012: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services begins accepting DACA applications. The Pew Research Center estimated that up to 1.7 million immigrants were eligible. November 2014: President Obama announces his intention to extend DACA-like protections to unauthorized parents of children who are U.S. citizens; the program is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA. December 2014: Texas and 25 other states sue the Obama administration to block the expanded protections from taking effect. February 2015: A federal district court in Texas blocks DAPA; the Supreme Court eventually deadlocks in the case, allowing this decision to stand. September 2017: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces the Trump administration is ending DACA, calling the program illegal, but delays the end date for six months to allow Congress time to find a legislative solution. Multiple states and DACA recipients immediately sued to block the program’s repeal. January 2018: A federal district court in California orders the Trump administration to continue accepting DACA renewal applications while litigation over the program’s repeal moves forward. At the time, approximately 700,000 young immigrants are enrolled in the program. An appeals court upholds this decision in November. June 2019: The Supreme Court agrees to hear the DACA case in its next term. November 2019: The Supreme court hears arguments in the DACA case. June 2020: The Supreme Court blocks cancellation of DACA, saying the Trump administration didn’t give an adequate explanation for doing so.
