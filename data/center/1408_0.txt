UNITED NATIONS—President         Barack Obama    outlined a U.S. approach to the Middle East for his last two years in office that tightly focuses on diminishing Islamic extremism and leans heavily on American military power, as he implored regional leaders to do more to combat what he called the single most pressing threat to global progress. In his sixth address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, Mr. Obama made clear that fighting what he called “the cancer of violent extremism,” embodied in groups such as Islamic State, now dominates his foreign policy agenda. (Latest:Obama Presses World to Act Against Islamic State)     “The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force,” Mr. Obama said. “So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.”     The world is at a crossroads, Mr. Obama said, and faces challenges that demand broad international coalitions. He cited Islamic State, the Sunni militant group also known as ISIS and ISIL; the West’s confrontation with Russia over its incursion in Ukraine; and the rapid spread of Ebola in West Africa.               Mr. Obama pointedly called on Muslim leaders to take steps to address the spread of extremism.

Last year he used the U.N. platform to articulate a sweeping vision for the Middle East that involved brokering a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, ending the civil war in Syria and reaching an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program.     This year, Mr. Obama addressed the General Assembly on the second day of U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State militants who have been fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which the U.S. also opposes.     He said a nuclear deal with Iran is still possible, although negotiators have already extended the talks once and are nearing a November deadline, and he went uncharacteristically off-script to take a swipe at Israel over the collapse of peace talks.     The failure of negotiations, Mr. Obama said, is “something worthy of reflection within Israel.”

The president’s 39-minute speech was the cornerstone of his three days of diplomacy against the backdrop of the annual U.N. gathering, which he’s using as an opportunity to press other leaders for additional commitments to combat the Islamic State.     He arrived after securing commitments from five Arab states to participate U.S.-led airstrikes against Islamic State’s stronghold in Syria, and is seeking to build on that participation.      At a U.N. lunch, Mr. Obama was seated with Turkish President         Recep Tayyip Erdogan,    as well as the leaders of Jordan and Egypt. Turkey has been a weak link in Mr. Obama’s effort to form a coalition, but U.S. officials hope that will change since the release of Turkish hostages held by Islamic State.     On Wednesday Mr. Obama met for the first time with Iraq’s new Prime Minister         Haider al-Abadi.    He expressed confidence the Shiite leader will govern more inclusively than his predecessor. Mr. Abadi said Mr. Obama promised the U.S. would send new arms and equipment “as soon as possible” to aid Iraqi forces.     The Obama administration had held back on additional military assistance to Iraq until its leaders formed a new government, in particular a new prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki, whose approach U.S. officials have argued led to the rise of Islamic State.     “Prime Minister Abadi understands that in order for Iraq to succeed, it’s not just a matter of a military campaign,” Mr. Obama said, but also political outreach. “I want to say directly to the prime minister that we fully support his political vision.”     Mr. Obama also headed up a U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday on the threat of foreign fighters—people with Western passports who enlist in groups such as Islamic State. The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to address the issue and urged members over the next year to follow up by adopting measures to “counter extremist ideologies.”     He was scheduled to meet with Egyptian President         Abdel Fattah al Sisi    before returning to Washington.      Mr. Obama has no planned meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. The U.S., Iran and other nations are holding nuclear talks on the sidelines of the General Assembly. In his speech, Mr. Obama called on Iran’s leaders to “not let this opportunity pass.”           Related           “We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful,” he said of Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Russian President      Vladimir Putin’s        actions in Ukraine have demonstrated “a vision of the world in which might makes right,” Mr. Obama said, whereas the U.S. believes “that right makes might—that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones.”     Mr. Obama said the U.S. will lift sanctions against Russia if Mr. Putin pulls back his support for separatists and agrees to a diplomatic solution to the conflict.     The president, who is also convening a U.N. meeting Thursday on the Ebola epidemic, described a world “at a crossroads between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope.”     Yet despite all these global challenges, he said extremism is the “one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail” progress.                                                 President Barack Obama told the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday that the world is at a crossroads. He called for international coalitions to deal with Islamic State, the Russia-Ukraine confrontation and the spread of Ebola.

As he urged other leaders to address unrest in their countries, Mr. Obama highlighted the violence last summer in Ferguson, Mo., to say the U.S. still has work to do on this front as well. In the wake of the shooting of         Michael Brown,    Mr. Obama said it was clear to the world that “we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.”     Write to Carol E.
