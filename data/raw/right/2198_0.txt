Where the candidates stand in Minnesota has largely been up in the air so far due to scant polling, thus making the state one of the night’s wildcards. But the speculation is over, as Fox News has called the race for Sen. Marco Rubio, making the North Star State his first and only win of the night. Sen. Ted Cruz is currently in second, followed by Donald Trump.  Minnesota has 38 Republican delegates up for grabs, which are proportionally given to candidates based on the number of votes they receive during the caucus.
