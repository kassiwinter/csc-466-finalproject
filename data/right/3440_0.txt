Federal prosecutors in New York have started a sex crimes investigation involving him, according to the Wall Street Journal.Late last year a number of women came forward and accused Weinstein of unwanted and grotesque sexual acts. After weeks of silence, twice failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton finally condemned Weinstein, but didn't mention whether she would return hundreds-of-thousands of dollars he raised for her campaign.

After being called out as hyprocrites for claiming to care about the issue of sexual assault while pocketing the cash, the DNC donated the money to other leftist political organizations.
