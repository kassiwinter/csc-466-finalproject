WASHINGTON—President Trump’s longtime confidant         Roger Stone    was sentenced to three years and four months in prison on Thursday for lying to Congress and witness tampering, after a tumultuous two weeks in which Mr. Trump denounced the handling of the case and the government trial lawyers withdrew.At a 2½-hour hearing in a filled-to-capacity courtroom, U.S. District Judge         Amy Berman Jackson    repeatedly criticized Mr. Stone, saying that he had shown “flagrant disrespect” for Congress and the court, and dismissed claims that he was being prosecuted for his politics. “The problem is that nothing about this case was a joke. It wasn’t funny. It wasn’t a stunt and it wasn’t a prank,” Judge Jackson said.     Hours after the sentencing, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Stone’s conviction as unfair and repeated his call for the exoneration of his former political adviser, who has asked for a new trial based on the alleged bias of a juror in his case. “I want the process to play out,” Mr. Trump said in comments in Las Vegas.               While Mr. Trump suggested he wouldn’t immediately intervene in Mr. Stone’s case, he left the door open to exercising his presidential power to pardon or commute Mr. Stone’s sentence. “I’m going to watch the process…and at some point I’m going to make a recommendation.” His comments marked a sharp shift from two days earlier, when he said he hadn’t given “any thought” to pardoning Mr. Stone.     Mr. Stone, a Republican consultant who has known Mr. Trump for decades, was convicted in November in a case that resulted from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.     The sentence was far less than the seven to nine years that trial prosecutors had initially recommended under federal guidelines before Attorney General         William Barr    and other senior officials overruled their recommendation and suggested a lighter punishment.

Judge Jackson said following the guidelines would result in a sentence that “would be greater than necessary,” but criticized what she described as the Justice Department’s “unprecedented” reversal. She said prosecutors were right to endorse a guideline sentence, as they do in the vast majority of criminal cases.      The judge said she was basing her sentence on those imposed in other comparable cases, referencing the 30 months that I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a former top aide to Vice President         Dick Cheney,    received for his 2007 conviction of lying to a grand jury and obstructing justice. Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Libby in 2018.      At the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney         John Crabb    backed the original recommendations of prosecutors in calculating a guideline range, a development that seemed to minimize the Justice Department’s second recommendation calling for a lighter sentence.      Judge Jackson acknowledged Mr. Stone’s history of cultivating a public persona as a provocateur and a prankster. But she ruled that Mr. Stone’s pretrial behavior—including questioning the legitimacy of the proceedings and posting online after being ordered not to—should be taken into account.                                         Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for lying to Congress about his contact with WikiLeaks, the organization that released emails hacked by Russian intelligence officials.

Crowds began gathering early Thursday at the federal courthouse in Washington, with cameras lining both entrances and Mr. Stone’s supporters holding a banner outside the courthouse that asked Mr. Trump to #PardonRogerStone and another group with a two-story inflatable rat.     Mr. Stone declined to speak at the hearing. The flamboyant Republican operative won’t have to start serving his sentence until after Judge Jackson rules on his request for a new trial. She hasn’t specified when that will occur.      His defense attorneys argued that his age, lack of criminal history and involvement in charitable causes warranted a sentence of probation.                                                 President Trump said Thursday he would ‘love to see Roger exonerated.’                  Photo:            Evan Vucci/Associated Press                                                                                                             Given the lack of criminal history, the judge calculated the recommended sentence at 5.8 to 7.25 years in prison.     Judges often depart from those guidelines. The guidelines suggested that Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman,         Paul Manafort,    for example, faced around 20 years in prison for financial crimes including tax fraud, but he was ultimately sentenced to a total of around 7½ years in prison.      In the Stone case, prosecutors filed their initial recommendation last week based on those guidelines. Mr. Trump said their recommendation was “horrible and very unfair.”      Within hours, senior Justice Department officials ordered a lower recommendation that suggested the court could appropriately discount several additional levels of punishment. That prompted the four trial prosecutors to withdraw from the case.     At the sentencing hearing, Judge Jackson noted that it was unusual for the government not to argue for the maximum sentence.      Mr. Crabb from the U.S. attorney’s office tried to reassure the court that they were not backing away from the prosecution but declined to discuss the specifics of why the Justice Department filed two separate memos.     “The Department of Justice and United States attorney’s office is committed to enforcing the law without fear, favor or political influence,” said Mr. Crabb. “This prosecution was and is righteous.”     Mr. Crabb attributed the two memos to a “miscommunication” between prosecutors in Washington, D.C., and leaders in the Justice Department, but declined to elaborate.     Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Stone’s prosecution centered on one of the jurors in his case, a woman who had previously run for Congress as a Democrat. He called her “totally tainted” on Thursday at the graduation ceremony for Hope for Prisoners, a program that helps those leaving prison re-enter the workforce and their communities.     According to transcripts of jury selection, Mr. Stone’s lawyers asked the juror in question about potential bias—including Democratic politics—but didn’t seek to exclude her from the jury pool.     Mr. Trump’s comments came after Mr. Barr said in an unusual television interview last week that Mr. Trump’s tweets about Justice Department cases made it “impossible” for him to do his job. Since then, Mr. Trump has showed no sign of easing his commentary on cases related to his former advisers, though he acknowledged that he was aware his tweets complicated Mr. Barr’s job.     A federal jury convicted Mr. Stone of lying to Congress in its investigation of Russian election interference and misleading lawmakers about his efforts to make contact with WikiLeaks, which published emails stolen from Democrats that jolted the 2016 campaign. He was also convicted of tampering with a witness, Randy Credico, a New York comedian who had evidence to contradict Mr. Stone.     That count carries a heftier punishment than the others Mr. Stone faced, as physical harm or threats to potential witnesses against a defendant are considered among the most serious crimes in the U.S. criminal-justice system.     At trial, prosecutors highlighted dozens of expletive-filled text messages and emails in which Mr. Stone pressured Mr. Credico to stonewall Congress, including saying at one point he was going to take Mr. Credico’s dog, and relaying in another: “Prepare to die.”     Mr. Stone’s attorneys unsuccessfully argued that the threats against Mr. Credico were simply the way the two men communicated.     “They have a long 20-year relationship. In the context of that private conversation, Mr. Credico understood that it was just Stone being Stone. He’s all bark, no bite,” said defense attorney         Seth Ginsberg.         Mr. Credico testified at the trial, and later wrote to the court that he never personally felt threatened by Mr. Stone and urged the judge not to send him to prison.     On Thursday, Judge Jackson referred to Mr. Credico’s testimony before the grand jury in which he said he was wearing a disguise at times and went into hiding because he was afraid for his safety.      “His level of concern may have changed over time,” Judge Jackson said.     —Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.
