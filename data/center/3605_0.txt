         MOSCOW—Russian officials and companies were bracing for further economic pain Thursday, as the U.S. decision to punish the Kremlin for an alleged nerve-agent attack in the U.K. diminished hopes of a bilateral thaw.      The ruble registered the steepest daily decline in almost two years, losing as much as 5% against the dollar since the State Department said Wednesday it would impose new sanctions on Russia later this month over the incident. Russian blue-chip stocks plunged as much as 9%, led by state banks and national airline Aeroflot, which risk losing access to U.S. markets if the sanctions are deepened.      The Kremlin on Thursday denied playing any role in the attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in southern England earlier this year, while playing down the importance of the sanctions. President      Vladimir Putin’s        spokesman said Russia remains committed to building “constructive relations with the U.S.” and wouldn’t draft countermeasures before learning the full details.          Although the first tranche of sanctions would focus on Russia’s defense sector and have a limited initial effect, according to political analysts, investors and firms are preparing for a downward spiral of measures and countermeasures that would hurt the wider economy. A spate of Western sanctions against Russia since Mr. Putin’s decision to annex Crimea in 2014 have already wiped out half of the ruble’s value, reduced investment in the energy sector and crippled aluminum giant         United Co. Rusal    PLC.          The second set, which could be triggered by the end of the year, would include the downgrade or suspension of diplomatic relations, suspension of flights between the U.S. and Russia, and restriction of imports of Russian goods. A separate set of financial measures against Russia being considered in Congress would reduce the country’s ability to raise capital abroad.

The deepening rift between Moscow and the West is raising tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War. Following a coordinated response by Western allies, scores of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers have been expelled. WSJ's Niki Blasina explains the escalating situation. (Originally published March 29, 2018)                                                                                                     The second-largest state bank, VTB, which is already restricted by the U.S. from issuing foreign debt, said it is analyzing the potential impact of the sanctions to protect its business and clients. The second-biggest gas producer, Novatek, said it would redouble its efforts to switch to sales contracts in local currencies.     Lawmakers from Russia’s ruling party accused U.S. politicians of treating the country like a punching bag in their partisan infighting and in midterm campaigning. On state television, analysts and commentators lamented President      Donald Trump’s        inability to push through a hostile Congress a reset in relations with Russia following a summit with Mr. Putin in Helsinki last month.     The head of the foreign-relations committee of Russia’s senate,         Konstantin Kosachev,    compared the new sanctions to a “lynching.”      “The U.S. is once again behaving like a police state, beating out evidence from suspects by threats and torture,” he told Interfax.
