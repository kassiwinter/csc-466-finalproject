The fate of the cease-fire agreement negotiated by the U.S. and Turkey in northeastern Syria was uncertain Friday, as skirmishes erupted between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces and questions arose about the boundaries of a buffer zone from which the Kurds are expected to withdraw.President Trump said his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told him in a phone call that “minor sniper and mortar fire” had stopped. Mr. Erdogan dismissed the clash reports as “disinformation.” A U.S. official said most of the fighting has ended but it would take time for orders to stop the combat to filter through the ranks. The deal reached Thursday commits Turkey to suspending its military incursion into Kurdish-held areas for 120 hours in return for a U.S. pledge to facilitate a withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish fighters from the border area. The Kurds were allied with the U.S. in the fight against Islamic State but Ankara regards them as a terrorist threat.      The agreement didn’t specify the size of what Turkey refers to as the safe zone. But Mr. Erdogan said there should be no confusion that Turkey plans to seize control over a roughly 20-mile by 300-mile area stretching from the city of Manbij all the way to Syria’s border with Iraq on the east.               “This is what we call the safe zone,” Mr. Erdogan told reporters, circling the area on a large map with a laser pointer.      The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have said that the zone proposed to them was significantly narrower than the one described by Mr. Erdogan. The SDF has said it would abide by the five-day cease-fire, but there were no signs they were pulling back from the area on Friday.      U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper didn’t comment on the size of the buffer zone, but said the U.S., which has withdrawn its troops from combat areas, would have no role in enforcing it.      A senior U.S. defense official said that the U.S. would continue to watch over the area with drones, to maintain surveillance of conditions on the ground and prison camps where Kurdish forces are holding Islamic State fighters.     People living near the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ain and two officials in the SDF, reported that sporadic clashes, drone strikes and artillery shelling resumed overnight and increased into the morning. One strike hit a hospital in Ras al-Ain, according to the Kurdish Red Crescent.

Fateh Hassoun, a commander in the Turkish-backed forces, blamed the Kurds for the clashes. “Some of the SDF mercenaries are still firing mortars in Ras al-Ain and fighting,” he said. “The other areas have small clashes.”     Turkey’s incursion marks a pivotal chapter in the multisided Syrian war. The Trump administration’s decision this month to withdraw its troops from northeastern Syria has created a vacuum for President Bashar al-Assad’s government and his ally, Russia, to fill. It has also forced the SDF to weigh whether to fight Turkey alone or throw their lot in with Mr. Assad.     Mr. Erdogan said he wouldn’t negotiate with Kurdish forces but conceded that much had yet to be discussed with Russia to achieve his safe-zone goal. The Turkish president said he was concerned that Kurdish fighters would seek support from Mr. Assad and Russian troops in cities where they are present.

On Friday, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin expected information from Ankara on the cease-fire agreement.     Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who helped negotiate the pause brokered by Vice President Mike Pence, said during a stop in Brussels that he is very hopeful the agreement will hold. He also said that European countries must help solve the crisis of Syrian refugees in Turkey and take back Islamic State fighters being held in northern Syria.     “Europe needs to seriously consider how to respond to this, this threat, this challenge that’s presented by migration,” he said.     Mr. Pompeo met with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to brief him on deal and reaffirm the U.S. commitment to confronting Iran.           Mr. Netanyahu hasn’t publicly criticized Mr. Trump’s decision to pull troops from Syria but has condemned the Turkish invasion and offered humanitarian assistance to the Kurds. Asked by reporters in Jerusalem about the cease-fire Mr. Netanyahu said, “We hope things will turn out for the best.”     On Friday afternoon, a convoy organized by activists of some 100 people and 80 vehicles including ambulances, attempted to reach Ras al-Ain, also known as Sarikani, to evacuate injured civilians and supply food, but was prevented by Turkish airstrikes, according to members of the convoy. Activists said they would try again.

Rudin Hassan and her 24-year-old husband Mohammad Shukri fled the town of Tal Abiad when the airstrikes hit last week. The Syrian Kurdish authorities have prevented people from fleeing, likely to maintain numbers to fight the Turkish offensive.

When you finish their work, they don’t care about you,” the 23-year-old Ms. Hassan said in an interview in a refugee camp near the Iraqi town of Bardarash.     Mr. Trump had dispatched the delegation led by Mr. Pence following a Monday phone call with his Turkish counterpart amid growing bipartisan alarm in Washington.      Sen., Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a critic of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, said he spoke on Friday with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, who he described as concerned that the safe zone sought by Turkey is tantamount to “ethnic cleansing” of Kurds.     “I hope we can find a win-win situation, but I share General Mazloum’s concerns,” Mr. Graham said.      —Isabel Coles in Duhok, Iraq, Felicia Schwartz in Jerusalem and Gordon Lubold and Vivian Salama in Washington contributed to this article.
