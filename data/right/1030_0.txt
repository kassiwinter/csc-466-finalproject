In response, Durkan said her city was "fine."Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy. https://t.co/o26PkJnYhA— Mayor Jenny Durkan (@MayorJenny) June 12, 2020From my time in the CHAZ/CHOP, I knew it would degrade and it was only a matter of time before the situation got really dangerous. It's why I knew the media would trip over themselves by just trying to portray the zone as a block party. While things were peaceful some of the time, there were plenty of other instances, particularly at night, where fights broke out and other crimes were committed.
