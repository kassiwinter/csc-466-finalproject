Thank you to all!” the president tweeted as the election returns painted mixed results for the Republican Party.                                                                                                                                                      After campaigning hard to fend off a possible “blue wave,” Mr. Trump saw his GOP lose the majority in the House but expand its majority in the Senate.                                                                                                                                                         He will face a challenge dealing with House Democrats, including an anticipated onslaught of investigations and subpoenas. But with the Senate still in Republican hands, Mr. Trump will have a firewall against attempts to undo his agenda and will be able to continue sending conservative judges to the federal bench.
