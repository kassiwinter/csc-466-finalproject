A long-term “innovation” fund designed to help states ensure people can buy insurance has been raised to $132 million.“We need to see what amount we’d have now with the increase in the long-term fund and then we can determine from there what we need,” he said.Asked if the $70 billion in additional funding was enough to ease his concerns, Hoeven said, “This is why we need to see the numbers.”“I’m reserving judgment at this point. I want to see the [Congressional Budget Office] score,” he said.Moderates have doubts about their leadership’s promises that the innovation fund will be enough to help people likely to lose health coverage after the generous federal subsidy for Medicaid expansion phases out by the end of 2024.Collins told reporters that leaders appeared to be double- and triple-counting to address various concerns raised by colleagues.“It seems to me you’re using that money over and over again,” she said, according to Talking Points Memo. “It’s supposed to relieve the cost of high premiums. It’s supposed to solve the problem with deductibles being unaffordable. It’s supposed to be available for high-risk or reinsurance pool. It’s supposed to be available under the Cruz Amendment to help prevent a huge increase in rates for people with pre-existing conditions.”A GOP aide said other moderates share her concerns.McConnell has told these centrists that healthcare costs for lower-income Americans will be covered by three pots of money: the funds set aside for tax credits and refundable tax credits, the $132 billion long-term state innovation fund and $45 billion to treat opioid addiction.“That’s what we talked about,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) of conversations with the leadership.Cassidy is one of 20 Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid enrollment under ObamaCare.He said leaders pledged the stabilization fund would also be enough to cover the higher costs of patients with pre-existing medical conditions.“States could use the stabilization fund to address the issues of pre-existing conditions that President Trump said he was going to address,” he said.But while $132 billion may sound like a lot for moderates, several senators who said they remain undecided on how to vote next week worry it might not be enough.Along with Cassidy, Hoeven, Portman, Capito and Heller said they were undecided on the procedural motion.Their votes may depend on the analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, which dealt a blow to the Senate legislation last month when it projected that 22 million people would be without health insurance in 2026 because of it.While the moderates are McConnell’s immediate concern, he has not completely protected his right flank.Sen. Mike LeeMichael (Mike) Shumway LeeSenate Republicans urge DOJ to reject request for 'no fly' list for unruly passengers Senate passes bill to make former internment camp national historic site Investigators find gaps in White House phone records from Jan. 6: report MORE (R-Utah), who joined Cruz in recent weeks in demanding insurance regulatory reform, says he remains undecided on the vote to proceed to the bill.Lee was left out of the deal that Cruz negotiated to allow insurance companies more flexibility to sell plans.Cruz conceded some ground to colleagues who worried the Cruz–Lee amendment would segment the insurance market and cause the premiums of older, sicker people who buy plans that meet ObamaCare’s regulatory requirements to skyrocket.He agreed to modify the language by tying the lower-cost risk pools of younger, healthier people who buy cheaper bare-bones plans to the higher-cost risk pools of people who purchase more expensive plans that meet federal requirements.This is believed to rein in the costs for people with pre-existing conditions.Leaders have also told moderates that the $132 billion innovation fund can be used to subsidize the cost of high-risk pools as well, but moderates are concerned this will leave less money to cover those likely to lose insurance coverage because Medicaid spending reductions.
