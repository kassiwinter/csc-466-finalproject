President Obama on Monday defended himself against Republican criticism that he misled the public over his signature health care law, telling supporters that his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them.Obama has come under heavy criticism for his promises before the law was passed in 2010 that Americans who were happy with the plans they purchased on the open market could keep them. Since then, millions of people have received notices from their insurers that their plans have been canceled because of the new federal requirements.But at a health-care summit of supporters, Obama said the change was necessary because many of those insurance plans would not cover the costs of medical care."If we allowed these old plans to be downgraded ... when the law was already passed, we would have broken an even more important promise: making sure Americans get access to health care that doesn't leave them one illness away from financial ruin," the president told more than 200 members of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit group started by his former campaign apparatus to support the administration's agenda.
