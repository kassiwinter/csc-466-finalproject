WASHINGTON—Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify Tuesday before the same Senate committee that heard from former FBI Director         James Comey    last week, keeping national attention on a Russia investigation that White House officials have been trying to push to the background. Mr. Sessions earlier this year was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s investigation of Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election after he belatedly disclosed two meetings with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Comey, during his testimony last week, raised the possibility of other concerns about Mr. Sessions’s dealings with Russia during the campaign, saying Federal Bureau of Investigation leadership before the recusal was “aware of facts that I can’t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.”     In a weekend letter, Mr. Sessions canceled previously planned public testimony before House and Senate appropriations panels. He said that the testimony by Mr. Comey, whom         Mr. Trump    fired in early May, made it “important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,” which he said was the Senate Intelligence Committee.     It is unclear whether the intelligence committee hearing will be held in public.

The Comey appearance dominated a week in which the administration said it had hoped to highlight its stated goal to improve the nation’s infrastructure. This week, President Donald Trump will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.          The president’s schedule includes a visit to Wisconsin on Tuesday, where he will stop by a technical college—the same day Mr. Sessions is on Capitol Hill.      But Mr. Trump is helping to keep the Russia probe front and center. Last Friday, he blasted Mr. Comey in a joint news conference with the Romanian president.     In a tweet Sunday morning, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey “cowardly” for asking a friend to tell reporters about conversations he had with the president. During those conversations, Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump had talked about the investigation of former national security adviser         Mike Flynn’s    ties to Russia and had said, “I hope you can let this go.” The president denies having done that.     “I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump said Sunday morning. “Totally illegal? Very ‘cowardly!’ ”     Many legal experts say there was nothing illegal about Mr. Comey’s actions, given that the material wasn’t classified and that he was no longer a government employee. Mr. Comey testified last week that he asked his friend to share the content of the conversations so it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which it did, when former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named to the post.     Mr. Trump’s tweets are drawing rebukes even from people in his own party.     “I think the worst problem this president has in this instance is the president himself,” former Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.) said Sunday on CNN. “If he would stop talking about the small-ball individual tweets, attacking Director Comey personally, I think we could get beyond this.”     Sen.         Lindsey Graham    (R., S.C.), speaking on       CBS,    said Mr. Trump was obstructing his own agenda. Addressing Mr. Trump directly, Mr. Graham said: “You may be the first president in history to go down because you can’t stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that if you just were quiet, would clear you.”          But part of the Trump legal strategy is to call into question Mr. Comey’s credibility. Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump’s legal team, pointed to statements regarding the FBI investigation of         Hillary Clinton’s    use of a private email server while secretary of state.     “James Comey’s credibility has been brought into question on multiple occasions during the Clinton investigation, and here ultimately the special counsel has to weigh that as he does his investigation,” Mr. Sekulow said Sunday on ABC. Mr. Comey has defended his handling of the Clinton email probe.     Beyond his contacts with Russian officials, Mr. Sessions also may face questions about why he didn’t do more to shield Mr. Comey, who worked for him, from Mr. Trump’s private outreach.     Mr. Comey told the Senate panel that the president had Mr. Sessions and others leave the room so he could talk to Mr. Comey alone, and that is when Mr. Trump allegedly pressured him on the Flynn investigation.     Mr. Comey also said he later appealed to Mr. Sessions to ensure that he would not again be left alone with Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Sessions didn’t respond. A Justice Department spokesman rejected that characterization and said Mr. Sessions told Mr. Comey the agency needed to be careful about “following appropriate policies” regarding such contacts.     Mr. Sessions was a vocal advocate for Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and his staffers and former aides have taken jobs in the White House and across the administration. Still, Mr. Trump was upset after Mr. Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, one White House official said. The president, who has denied any involvement with Russia election hacking, viewed Mr. Sessions’s decision as a sign of weakness, the official said.     Mr. Sessions is also expected to face Senate questioning about why he was involved in firing Mr. Comey given that he had recused himself from questions related to Russia. As FBI director, Mr. Comey was overseeing that investigation.     In an interview with NBC News last month, Mr. Trump said he was thinking about “this Russia thing” when he decided to fire Mr. Comey, but the White House initially cited a recommendation for termination by Mr. Sessions and a deputy attorney general based on Mr. Comey’s broader job performance.                                         Responding to questions at a news conference on Friday, President Trump said he’d be willing to testify under oath that he didn’t ask former FBI director James Comey to ease off the investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn.

It doesn’t seem to stand up well to me,” Mr. Schumer said on CBS.     The attorney general also drew some criticism from Democrats for the en masse firings of U.S. attorneys, including Preet Bharara in Manhattan, earlier this year. Mr. Bharara said Sunday on ABC that Mr. Trump called him three times following his election and fired him less than a day after he refused to return the third call from the newly elected president.     “It appeared to be that he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship,” Mr. Bharara said in the TV interview.     The White House didn’t comment on Mr. Bharara’s account.     —Michael C. Bender and Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.
