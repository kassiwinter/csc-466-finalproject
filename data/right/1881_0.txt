                 | March 12, 2021 12:21 PM                Antifa protesters burned U.S. flags, stormed a bank, and clashed with police outside a federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday.       The original protest, intended as a demonstration against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, escalated when agitators began smashing a federal courthouse and burning American flags, according to the Daily Mail.            Protesters could be seen in videos posted on social media setting fires around the courthouse.       SENATE COMMITTEE SHOULD EXAMINE ALL TYPES OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE      “Antifa set fire to the federal courthouse in downtown Portland,” journalist Andy Ngo tweeted. “There are people inside.”            In another video, federal agents could be seen deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls into the crowd as they attempted to restore order.                   Rioters also attempted to break into a Chase bank and appeared to be kept at bay by an armed security guard.
