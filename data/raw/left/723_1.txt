This gets them a guaranteed spot in the Good Place!              The coronavirus pandemic has left many without jobs, making it difficult to pay for rent.                   Thankfully, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, who own a couple of residential buildings in Los Angeles, are taking notice of this and are waiving tenants' rent fees for April.                       TMZ reported that Dax's sister, who is the manager of Kristen and Dax's company Pringus Property LLC, emailed tenants over the weekend to let them know the great news and "promised to work with residents going forward as best as possible."                       This news comes after many landlords are under fire on Twitter for not waiving tenants' fees.                                                              This email went from an Indy landlord (RJR) to tenants this week. Talk about bad takes. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬                      01:33 AM - 19 Mar 2020                                                                                    When this is all over, remember how landlords behaved - and let's build a society without them.                      08:06 AM - 17 Mar 2020                                                                                    Landlords will not hesitate to evict people during any crisis.
My hope is that @LinaHidalgoTX, @RodneyEllis, and @AdrianGarciaHTX do all they can to freeze rent, mortgages, &amp; utilities until #COVID19 crisis is over.
Our county leaders need to house the homeless.
