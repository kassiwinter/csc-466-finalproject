More than 400 millionaires and billionaires will reportedly ask Congress not to cut their taxes.The group, which includes doctors, lawyers and chief executives, plans to send a letter to Congress and ask that their taxes not be cut under the GOP tax overhaul, The Washington Post reported.The letter asks Congress not to pass a bill that "further exacerbates inequality." It also says the tax bill should not add to the country's debt.The letter, put together by Responsible Wealth, a network that promotes progressive issues, says the GOP plan should increase taxes on the wealthy.Some people who have signed onto the letter include Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, fashion designer Eileen Fisher, billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros and philanthropist Steven Rockefeller.“I think a tax cut is absurd,” said Bob Crandall, a former American Airlines chief executive who signed the letter. Republicans are “saying we can’t afford to spend money, but we can afford to give rich people a huge tax break. This makes no sense,” Crandall said.House Republicans are nearing an initial victory on tax reform.
