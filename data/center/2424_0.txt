Clinton supported the trade deal as a member of the Obama administration, and her husband signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada into law as president.The Democratic nominee’s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs employees were another point of concern in the primaries that reflected worries among liberals that the Clintons are too closely tied to the financial industry.“We all know that Democrats adopted this progressive platform because of Bernie’s movement and that the Clinton circle accepted many of those things even though they don’t support them,” said Jonathan Tasini, a liberal economist and Sanders supporter who launched a primary challenge to Clinton in 2006 but is backing her in the general election.“I know with certainty that we’ll have epic battles on our hands with a Clinton administration on policy,” he said. “But that doesn’t run contrary to me wanting to see her do everything she can to defeat Donald Trump. That’s the motivating force right now.”Polls show liberal voters have coalesced behind Clinton since the Democratic National Convention last month.A Monmouth University survey released this week found Clinton receiving 92 percent support from Democrats, up from 88 percent last month and 85 percent in June. And a CNN survey that found Clinton receiving 94 percent support among Democrats also showed her with 86 percent support of former Sanders backers.At the same time, liberal groups have begun launching petitions and email campaigns to keep the pressure on Clinton to hold steady in her support of the progressive policies she embraced during the primaries.A coalition of 15 left-leaning groups sent a letter to Clinton on Wednesday in an effort to discourage her from putting former Wall Street executives in her Cabinet if she wins the White House.That follows pressure from DFA and another liberal group, Credo Action, which have been circulating petitions urging Clinton to use her planned major economic speech on Thursday near Detroit to announce opposition to a lame-duck session vote on the TPP.“We expect Clinton's Thursday economic speech to include numerous big progressive priorities,” Green said.
