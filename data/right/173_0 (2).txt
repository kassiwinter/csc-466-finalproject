      President Joe Biden will meet face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time as commander in chief next month.      The rivals will meet on June 16 in Geneva, Switzerland, as part of Biden's first presidential trip abroad to the United Kingdom and Europe, according to the White House.            "The leaders will discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the U.S.-Russia relationship," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday in a statement.      BIDEN TIME RUNNING OUT FOR REFORMS AS CONGRESS MISSES GEORGE FLOYD ANNIVERSARY DEADLINE      The meeting comes after the FBI blamed Russian-based cybercriminal group DarkSide for a ransomware attack on a major U.S. pipeline managed by Colonial Pipeline and following the Biden administration rolling out a slew of sanctions on Russia for allegedly undermining U.S. elections, other cyberattacks against the U.S. government and companies, and the country's treatment of dissidents and journalists, such as Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.       Biden also expelled 10 Washington-based Russian diplomats, some of whom the White House contends were spies.      Biden has indicated he wants a "stable and predictable" relationship with Putin but has warned the Russian leader he is prepared to introduce harsher penalties in response to future aggressive behavior. The two have already spoken on the phone twice since Biden's inauguration.
