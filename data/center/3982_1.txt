WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a southern border wall if Congress doesn’t fund it, following a Friday meeting with congressional leaders that both Mr. Trump and Democratic lawmakers described as contentious.It isn’t clear how Mr. Trump would fund a wall under that scenario, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly face legal challenges if he were to attempt such a move.                                                 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer leave the White House after meeting with President Trump.

Mr. Trump said he hoped the shutdown “doesn’t go on even beyond a few more days,” but also said he told congressional leaders that the shutdown could last for months or even years if Democrats don’t agree to fund the border wall.               In the meeting, House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said they lobbied Mr. Trump to fully reopen the government and then return to the debate over funding a border wall, saying such a move would give relief to affected federal workers. Mr. Trump rejected that approach.          Due to the partial shutdown, which started before Christmas, about 420,000 employees, deemed essential, are working without pay, while 380,000 federal employees have been placed on unpaid leave, or furlough. The first full missed paycheck for federal employees is Jan. 11.     Mrs. Pelosi described their meeting as “lengthy and sometimes contentious.” In one tense exchange during the meeting, Ms. Pelosi interrupted Ms. Nielsen, who was reciting statistics related to the border, according to a White House official. “I reject your facts,” Ms. Pelosi said. “These aren’t my facts,” Ms. Nielsen claimed. “These are the facts.”     Mr. Trump has said he won’t sign any bill funding the government that doesn’t include billions in funding for a border wall, a condition Democrats have rejected. The Democratic House passed bills this week that would reopen the government, but the GOP-controlled Senate is waiting for Mr. Trump’s blessing on any deal.     At his impromptu press conference Friday, Mr. Trump opened by characterizing the talks with Democrats as “very productive” and said White House officials and congressional staffers were set to meet over the weekend to continue the discussions.     The White House added late Friday that it had scheduled a meeting with staff from House and Senate leadership on Saturday morning.      Vice President      Mike Pence,        Homeland Security Secretary         Kirstjen Nielsen    and Mr. Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law         Jared Kushner    will lead the weekend talks on the White House end.     Later in his remarks, the president spoke of a possible lengthy shutdown and also floated the idea of bypassing Congress. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country,” he said, adding: “I may do it.” But he said he preferred to negotiate with lawmakers to obtain funding.     Mr. Trump didn’t offer any specifics on how declaring an emergency would allow him to build the wall. In the event of the declaration of national emergency, U.S. law allows the use of funds in the military budget that have been appropriated for construction projects to be used for projects directed by the administration.     A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee called the move “legally dubious” and said it would “invite a legal challenge from Congress.”                                         The government released a blockbuster jobs report despite a trade war with China and a partial government shutdown.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) attended the meeting but was absent from the press conference. Mr. Trump said that was because Mr. McConnell was “running the Senate.” The Senate adjourned at 11 a.m., before the White House meeting started.     A spokesman for the senator said he was unaware there would be a news conference. Some GOP senators, including         Susan Collins    of Maine and         Cory Gardner    of Colorado, have said they would support a spending bill to lift the shutdown without a deal on funding for the border wall, calling for those discussions to continue after the government reopens.     Mr. Trump opened Friday’s meeting with lawmakers with a 15-minute profanity-laced rant about impeachment, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Trump also told lawmakers he didn’t like the word shutdown and preferred the word “strike,” one of the people said.     Inside the White House, officials privately say a deal could be at least a week away, raising the possibility this may be the longest-ever lapse in federal spending. The longest shutdown in U.S. history under current rules lasted 21 days in 1995.     White House officials acknowledge that they have been outmaneuvered on the messaging over the shutdown, and don’t expect Democrats to let up.     Another challenge for White House negotiators is that only Mr. Trump has the authority to forge a deal, former White House chief strategist         Steve Bannon    said. “Only he speaks for Trump at the end of the day,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s 100% him.”     While Mr. Trump has repeatedly continued to call in public for about $5 billion in wall funding, Mr. Pence and top White House officials two weeks ago approached Mr. Schumer with a compromise: $2.5 billion in funding for the wall, according White House and Senate officials.        
Related        Mr. Schumer told the group—Mr. Pence, Mr. Kushner and acting White House chief of staff         Mick Mulvaney    —that the figure wouldn’t pass in the Senate. “Well, legislating is hard,” Mr. Pence told them, a White House official said. Another person familiar with the meeting said that Mr. Pence indicated that he wasn’t surprised Mr. Schumer couldn’t accept the offer.     The White House agreed to submit that proposal in writing, but never heard back from Mr. Schumer, the official said.     When the White House met with congressional leaders again on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer expressed his frustration over dealing with the White House. He pointed out the early offer from Mr. Pence, but noted that Mr. Trump continued to use the $5.6 billion number. “You never came up,” Mr. Pence told Mr. Schumer. “So the ask is now $5.6 billion.”     Mr. Trump, sitting with his arms folded, nodded, according to a person familiar with the exchange.     At the hourlong news conference, Mr. Trump ran through a laundry list of issues that he said could be solved with a border wall, from human trafficking to helping federal workers who haven’t been paid during the shutdown. He said he was considering a “see-through wall made of steel” along the border and added, without offering proof, that past presidents have told him they regretted not building a border wall first.     Mr. Trump took questions for so long during an overcast and chilly 45-degree day that he turned around at one point and joked that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who was standing next to him without a coat, must be cold.     “Here, take mine,” Mr. Trump said. The president didn’t remove his overcoat.     —Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.     Corrections & Amplifications   A government funding lapse in September 2013 lasted 16 days.
