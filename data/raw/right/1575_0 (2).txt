With as many times as outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid mentioned the Koch brothers in Senate floor speeches this year, you'd think that they were the ones who spent the most money during the 2014 midterm elections. Think again. Out of all the billionaires who donated money to causes or campaigns for the midterms, the top two were Democrats and they outspent everyone else on the list, combined. David Koch isn't even near the top. More from POLITICO: Billionaire Tom Steyer's pet issue is global warming. With the amount of money Steyer spent, a whopping $74.3 million, and the results he received in return, he got trounced. Michael Bloomberg has of course been focused on gun control. Neither one of these topics is popular with the majority of American voters and the results of the election, a Republican landslide, prove it. I look forward to the left continuing their charade about money being a problem in politics.
