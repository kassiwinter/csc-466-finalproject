                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON — President Obama says the nation must do more than just remember its fallen heroes on Memorial Day.                                                                                                                                                      In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama says the country must care for the loved ones the fallen leave behind. He says the country must also make sure that all veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned.                                                                                                                                                      Obama says that, above all, the armed forces must have the support needed to carry out their missions at home and abroad.                                                                                                                                                         In the Republican address, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe thanks the nation for its prayers and support following Monday’s deadly tornado in his home state. He recalls past natural and man-made disasters in Oklahoma and says that while the state was hard hit, “we’re not knocked out.”                                                                                                                                                                                                     Copyright © 2022 The Washington Times, LLC.
