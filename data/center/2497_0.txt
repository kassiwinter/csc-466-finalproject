    U.S. employers hired in September at nearly the same modest pace as the prior month. The economy added 156,000 jobs last month, compared with a revised 167,000 in August. The jobless rate rose a tick to 5%, but wages also improved. Here’s how economists and analysts reacted to Friday’s report.     "A blah September jobs report gives no impetus for anything on the economy's to-do list: There's no sign of an overheating economy that would justify a rate hike; no ground swell of construction hiring that would finally hint at a return to a normal pace of housing starts; no big wage gains that would give hope for renewed productivity gains. Just a stubbornly average report at a time when the economy is looking for a jolt of the spectacular." —Nela Richardson, Redfin      "Even allowing for the weakness of productivity growth, however, the Fed isn’t going to be rushing into action when wage growth is that tepid." —Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics     “If the Fed wants to take from this report that the economy is robust, expanding, and in need of higher policy rates there is certainly enough in here to support such action. They have, after all, essentially convinced themselves and some others that as along as total payroll growth is above 150,000 per month this suggests strong economic growth.” —Steve Blitz, M Science          “The September employment report presents more of the same: modest economic data that disappoints a little bit.” —Jason Schenker, Prestige Economics     “There's jobs out there and people are coming off the sidelines looking for work, which shows the economy still has traction and isn't in danger of going off the rails yet.” —Chris Rupkey, MUFG Union Bank     "While unemployment fell for those with college degrees, it jumped for adults with a high-school degree or less. The least well-off took a step back in September." —Jed Kolko, Indeed     "The September employment data met expectations, roughly speaking....The results keep the Fed on track to raise rates in December." —Curt Long, National Association of Federal Credit Unions     "The number in the report that may raise some eyebrows is the unemployment rate....More individuals continue to return to the workforce as labor market conditions have tightened." —Jim Baird, Plante Moran Financial Advisors     "It is quite likely that the odds of an interest rate hike in December will be re-priced a tiny bit lower by investors following these numbers, especially given recent market volatility. In reality though attention is far more focused on what might happen come Nov. 8.” —James Athey, Aberdeen Asset Management     RELATED     U.S. Added 156,000 Jobs in September; Jobless Rate Rose to 5%     Hilsenrath: Jobs Data Ensures No Fed Rate Increase in November     September Jobs Report by the Numbers     The September Jobs Report in 10 Charts     Interactive: Job Market Tracker     Jobless Claims Hover Near Four-Decade Low (Oct. 6)     ADP Private Payrolls Rise 154,000 in September (Oct. 5)        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
