SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador—Attorney General         William Barr    said his review of the origins of the Russia investigation is focused on U.S. intelligence gathering before the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened its formal inquiry in July 2016 and could lead to rule changes for counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.“Government power was used to spy on American citizens,” Mr. Barr told The Wall Street Journal, in his first interview since taking office in February. “I can’t imagine any world where we wouldn’t take a look and make sure that was done properly.” He added: “Just like we need to ensure that foreign actors don’t influence the outcome of our elections, we need to ensure that the government doesn’t use its powers to put a thumb on the scale.”     Mr. Barr’s first few months on the job have been dominated by controversy surrounding his handling of special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    report and its aftermath, including his vocal defense of President Trump, whose actions he determined didn’t constitute a crime. Mr. Barr began his own investigation into the early stages of the Russia probe, a move Democrats and some former law-enforcement officials said was a politically motivated attempt to appease Mr. Trump and his Republican allies. Mr. Barr denied that criticism.           In his Wednesday interview, he declined to elaborate or offer any details on what prompted his concerns about the genesis of the Russia probe.     Mr. Barr spoke to the Journal on board a government plane en route to El Salvador, where he is seeking ways to step up international cooperation against the street gang MS-13.     Former Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein    and FBI Director         Christopher Wray    have said in recent weeks they believed the investigation that was opened in July 2016 was appropriate or they had seen no evidence that any illegal activity had taken place. Mr. Wray has distanced himself from Mr. Barr’s use of the term “spying” for legally permissible FBI surveillance.     Mr. Barr, meanwhile, has continued to use the word, saying he didn’t mean it pejoratively, though he has been criticized for using language that echoes Mr. Trump’s Russia probe rhetoric.

Mr. Barr didn’t offer a timetable for the completion of the review. He is working closely with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Mr. Wray.     Mr. Barr didn’t specify what changes to protocol he is considering. FBI agents are governed by hundreds of pages of rules and guidelines about how they conduct investigations, including those involving political campaigns. But the circumstances surrounding a counterintelligence probe involving a presidential campaign posed novel questions for the bureau.     “We went to the books that we had available to us. There is some guidance, and we applied the law….It’s just very difficult,’’ Jim Baker, who was the FBI’s general counsel at the beginning of the Russia inquiry, said in a Lawfare podcast last week.                                         The House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress after he defied their request for an unredacted Mueller report.

In 2008, Mr. Durham investigated the CIA’s destruction of videotapes showing the torture of terrorism suspects and later looked at whether agency officials broke any laws.     Mr. Barr wouldn’t specify what pre-election activities he found troubling, nor would he say what information he has reviewed thus far or what it has shown. He said he was surprised that officials have been so far unable to answer many of his questions.     “I have more questions now than when I came in,” he said, but declined to detail them.

Mr. Barr invoked Vietnam-era intelligence abuses like the surveillance of antiwar activists as a reason to raise these questions.      Mr. Trump and his congressional allies have praised Mr. Barr’s work as an acknowledgment of their allegations that Trump associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance and that federal law-enforcement officials were politically biased against the president in a way that could have affected their work. Former officials have defended their actions as appropriate given the alarming nature of the information they had.     The special counsel’s report detailed extensive efforts by the Russians to interfere in the 2016 election, but it didn’t establish a conspiracy with the Trump campaign. It also detailed efforts by Mr. Trump to influence the investigation but didn’t reach a conclusion on whether he obstructed justice.      Mr. Barr’s review comes as the Justice Department’s inspector general is also examining whether law enforcement appropriately obtained surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign aide. Another U.S. attorney, John Huber, was also asked to look at issues related to the Russia investigation and several other allegations against the FBI by Republicans, but Mr. Barr said he put that Russia-related inquiry on hold while the inspector general does his work.

Multiple former FBI officials have testified that the bureau opened the counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 into people affiliated with the Trump campaign after receiving information from the Australian government that a foreign-policy adviser to the campaign, George Papadopoulos, appeared to know about Russian plans to use “dirt” they had on Democratic presidential candidate         Hillary Clinton.         Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian government intermediary and served a two-week sentence, has since alleged he felt he was the victim of inappropriate investigative efforts by the U.S. government.     An FBI informant,         Stefan Halper,    and a woman who identified herself as his research assistant, for example, both met with Mr. Papadopoulos soon after the opening of the investigation, and pushed him to say whether Russia was helping the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Papadopoulos’s book, “Deep State Target.” Mr. Halper hasn’t commented on the allegations.     The FBI also obtained a warrant to monitor the electronic communications of another Trump foreign-policy adviser,         Carter Page,    after he left the campaign, in part by using information provided to them by         Christopher Steele,    a former British agent and past reliable source, who at the time was being paid by Democrats to conduct his research.     Former officials have defended their actions as appropriate, given the circumstances. In June 2016, the Democratic National Committee said it had been breached by Russian government hackers, as leaked emails from Democrats started appearing online.      “The case was about Russia, period, full stop. That was the focus of the investigation,” Mr. Baker, the FBI’s former general counsel, said on the Lawfare podcast. “It would have been highly, highly inappropriate for us not to pursue it,” he said.
