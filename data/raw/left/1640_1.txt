Yet another source confirms 2014 was the Earth's warmest year on record.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) this week agreed with NASA, NOAA and the Japanese Meteorological Agency, all of which made their announcements last month.The WMO, a United Nations agency, reported the average global air temperature in 2014 was 1.03 degrees above the long-term average of 57.2 degrees. That puts 2014 slightly ahead of both 2010 and 2005, the previous warmest two years."Analysis of the datasets indicates that 2014 was nominally the warmest on record, although there is very little difference between the three hottest years," WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said in a statement."The overall warming trend is more important than the ranking of an individual year," Jarraud said. The WMO noted 2014's record temperature happened even without the warming effects of an El Ni√±o event in the Pacific."Fourteen of the 15 hottest years have all been this century," he said. "We expect global warming to continue, given that rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the increasing heat content of the oceans are committing us to a warmer future."The only major group unable to officially declare 2014 as the hottest year is the U.K.'s Hadley Center, which gets data from the U.K. Met Office and the University of East Anglia. The Hadley Center said it's not possible to definitively say which of several recent years was the warmest.
