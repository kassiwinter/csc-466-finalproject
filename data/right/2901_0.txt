Mr. Kushner has been the target of increasing questions regarding his relationship to the foreign government after failing to disclose previous meetings in a security clearance form. This includes the meeting he attended with Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who they believed to have incriminating information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.                                                                                                                                                         Mr. Kushner said in his statement that he did not read the initial email that prompted the meeting. Mr. Trump Jr. has since released the emails relating to the meeting.
