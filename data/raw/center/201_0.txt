                                                A man who was spotted asking for beer money on ESPN's "College GameDay" broadcast has apologized for racist tweets that were uncovered by The Des Moines Register.The Register reported that it uncovered two racist jokes in Carson King's previous tweets, noting that one compared black mothers to gorillas and another made light of black people killed in the Holocaust.The tweets were from 2012, when King was 16 years old.King told local NBC affiliate WHO 13 that a reporter for the Register contacted him after his initial appearance on "GameDay" went viral and resulted in more than $1 million being deposited in his Venmo account by strangers.King apologized for the tweets in a statement delivered at a press conference Tuesday, before the publication of the Des Moines Register report, where he noted that he still plans to donate the money he received to charity."I cannot go back and change what I posted when I was a 16-year-old. I can apologize and work to improve every day and make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. And, I am so very thankful for the generosity of the thousands of people who have donated to our fundraising push for the Stead Family Children’s Hospital," he said, according to NBC.NBC noted that Anheuser Busch representatives have reportedly informed King that the company will sever its relationship with him after fulfilling a public agreement to donate to a charity on his behalf.“Carson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics," the spokesperson told NBC.
