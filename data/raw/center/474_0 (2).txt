 Several Hollywood figures are throwing their weight behind Gavin Newsom, as the California governor fights a recall election in the state.Voters in the Golden State are now just two weeks away from the gubernatorial recall election that will determine whether the sitting governor will remain in office for the rest of his term or lose his seat to one of his many challengers.All registered voters will receive a mail-in ballot ahead of the day on September 14 and a number of politically engaged celebrities are already using their platforms to support Newsom's effort."I know not all of you live in CA, but trust me, the #recall election there will affect you too, eventually," tweeted Bette Midler. "So, if you know someone in #California, nag someone in California! #KnowSomeoneNagSomeone. #VoteNoRecall."
Meanwhile, Charmed star Alyssa Milano urged her followers to return their mail-in ballot as soon as possible."CALIFORNIA-don't get complacent! Don't assume somebody else will vote," she tweeted. "We need each of you to #VoteNo and #StopTheRepublicanRecall if we're going to protect the state from a Trump clone. Please vote NO and return your ballot as soon as you can."
Marvel star Mark Ruffalo also reminded his followers of the voter registration deadline, tweeting: "CALIFORNIA: There's a Special Election on September 14th to determine whether to recall Governor Newsom. Are you registered to vote? The voter registration deadline is TODAY. Visit https://registertovote.ca.gov #StopTheRecall."
Actress Amber Tamblyn added: "I'm a California native born and raised. Please, my fellow Californians, this is NOT the right choice or the way forward.
