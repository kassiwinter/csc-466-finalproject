PROVO, Utah—The recent flurry of court rulings legalizing and then halting gay marriage in Utah has whipsawed residents of this predominantly Mormon city, a conservative enclave that saw its first-ever gay pride celebration only last summer.For same-sex couples here who say they endure stares and whispers while walking hand in hand, news that they could suddenly marry was almost unbelievable, said Todd Markham, who wed his partner, Addison Rose, during the brief 18-day window when same-sex marriages were allowed. Meanwhile, city leaders here say they have been receiving emails and calls from residents. "Many people feel that their family values are being attacked," said Gary Winterton, a Provo city councilman.     The last three weeks have been a whirlwind for the entire state, beginning with a federal judge's Dec. 20 ruling striking down Utah's 10-year-old gay-marriage ban. Then, this past Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court put a halt to same-sex weddings while that ruling is appealed. On Wednesday, Utah's governor announced that the state wouldn't recognize the 1,300 same-sex marriages already performed. On Friday, the federal government announced it would honor those unions.               The Justice Department's move gives same-sex couples married in Utah the same federal status as those wed where gay marriage is legal—currently 17 states and the District of Columbia. It means they qualify for certain federal benefits and would be able to jointly file tax returns.     But they won't be able to enjoy state benefits normally afforded to married couples following Republican Gov. Gary Herbert's decree to put recognition on hold during the state's appeal. Adding to the confusion, the state's attorney general said he couldn't come to a conclusion on the legal status of the unions.      As the first deeply conservative state where gay marriage became legal, albeit briefly, Utah is being watched from around the country. National gay-rights advocacy groups are jumping into the legal battle, and attorneys in lawsuits challenging gay marriage bans in some other states have referenced U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's opinion that the state ban was unconstitutional.      While same-sex couples here have gone from elation to uncertainty, opponents of gay marriage have been stepping up their efforts in wake of the recent rulings, organizing meetings around the state. Utah is home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a leading voice against same-sex marriage. The state, which is more than 60% Mormon, had passed its gay-marriage ban with support from 66% of voters in 2004.      A 2012 poll by the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University found that 72% of Utah voters oppose gay marriage. The center also found 43% supported civil unions, which provide some legal benefits to the couples, up from 25% in 2004.     In brief official statements since the ruling, the Mormon church has reaffirmed its position that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.     Just before Judge Shelby's ruling, Salt Lake City couple Michael Ferguson and Seth Anderson, both 32 years old, had planned to take part in a protest at the Salt Lake County Clerk's office. When the couple instead raced to the county building to get married after the ruling, the clerks at first thought the men were engaging in the planned protest.     The turn of events was as unfathomable as it was sudden for the clerks and the two men, who both grew up as Mormons.     "If five years ago, when I was this closeted Mormon boy, you told me, 'You're going to be marrying the man you love in Utah,' I would've thought you were crazy," said Mr. Ferguson.     To the many opponents of gay marriage here, the ruling was equally stunning.     "It would be the opposite equivalent of Ronald Reagan getting elected mayor of San Francisco—you would say, 'What just happened?' " said Paul T. Mero, president of the Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank in Utah, about the legalization ruling. Mr. Mero said Judge Shelby kicked "the voice of the people to the curb."     The state attorney general is pressing an appeal of Judge Shelby's ruling with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and is expected to take the case to the Supreme Court, if necessary. The appeals court is considering the case on an expedited basis, and written arguments are due next month.     In Provo, the home of Brigham Young University, residents have been gathering in neighborhood meetings to discuss the flurry of events, said Mr. Winterton, the councilman. "We want to make sure we're always accepting of people, and on the other hand, we want to make sure that we do what we can to protect our values of the traditional families that we believe in," he said.     Michael Mathie, 44, and Tyler McCraley, 32, were among the hundreds of same-sex couples to get a marriage license in Salt Lake County after the ruling, but planned a wedding for Saturday instead of marrying immediately.      They have canceled the ceremony, said a crestfallen Mr. Mathie, a designer and event planner, who called the legal turn of events "a big blow."     But, he said, "our families would've killed us if we did it without them."     —Andrew Grossman contributed to this article.
