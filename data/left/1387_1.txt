Kim Hjelmgaard, and William M. WelchSeveral Arab countries have offered to carry out airstrikes against Islamic State militants, along with the United States, State Department officials said Sunday.The offer was disclosed by officials traveling with Secretary of State John Kerry, but the Arab countries were not identified.The officials briefed the Associated Press and others on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic developments.In Washington, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said the administration will find countries willing to send combat troops to fight the Islamic extremists, who have taken control of large parts of Syria and Iraq. He said it was too soon to identify the countries.McDonough, speaking on Fox News Sunday, defended the idea of training and arming Syrian rebels. Since the U.S. is not sending ground troops, he said, "we ought to make sure that the Syrians are taking this fight, which is their fight," to the Islamic State.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said his nation is preparing to contribute 600 troops and up to 10 military aircraft to the campaign against the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS.Kerry is in Paris for a meeting Monday on providing aid to the new Iraqi government after spending the week in the Middle East rounding up support against the Islamic State extremists.With a war-weary U.S. public reluctant to send American troops into the conflict, President Obama announced Wednesday that the United States will ramp up airstrikes and try to build an international coalition to degrade and destroy the group.The Islamic State released a video late Saturday showing a militant beheading a British aid worker, David Haines, 44. It was similar to recent videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.In London, British Prime Minister David Cameron held an emergency meeting of his military and security chiefs, calling the Islamic State militants "monsters."Cameron said the Islamic State, which released the video of the killing, poses a "massive" security threat that cannot be ignored."They are not Muslims, they are monsters," he said. He hailed the slain Haines as a "British hero."He added: "Step by step, we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy (the Islamic State) and what it stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way — but with an iron determination."After Sunday's meeting, Cameron did not announce new military measures. He did say that British forces would continue offering logistical help to the U.S. and that counterterrorism efforts will increase because the Islamic State group is planning attacks against Britain.Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it saw no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released Saturday showing Haines, kneeling beside a masked militant who speaks in British-accented English.The 2½-minute video is titled "A Message to the Allies of America" and shows Haines delivering a direct message to Cameron.The video also contains a threat to Alan Henning, another British national being held by the extremist group.Haines, a father of two who grew up in Perth, Scotland, but who settled in Croatia after working for several humanitarian agencies there and in Libya and South Sudan, was abducted last year in Syria.His brother, Mike, released a statement mourning his family's loss."David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair," Mike Haines said.Contributing: The Associated Press
