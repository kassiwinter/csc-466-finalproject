                 | February 26, 2020 09:35 AM                Senate Democrats plan to seek $8.5 billion in new federal funding to battle the coronavirus outbreak after condemning President Trump’s $2.5 billion request as inadequate.      Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “is preparing a detailed Senate request” for the money, a top aide told the Washington Examiner.            “Expect Schumer’s request to be finalized this morning and sent to appropriators,” the aide said.       Democrats on Tuesday dismissed the Trump administration's $2.5 billion emergency funding request as far too low to prepare the nation to combat the virus in an adequate manner, given its spread in several countries. Democrats point out Congress appropriated $7 billion to battle the spread of the H1N1 virus 11 years ago.      Congress is preparing to take up the supplemental spending measure soon, but the final number will have to be negotiated between Democrats and Republicans in both chambers.       The House, run by Democrats, has not yet proposed a spending figure and is likely to take up the legislation first, as is customary.      Senate Republicans on Tuesday agreed with Democrats that Trump’s request may be too low.      Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said health officials would “need more money” than the funding requested by the administration.      Shelby said no amount has been decided but said Congress “would more than adequately fund it, because we cannot make a mistake.”      Lawmakers said they expect Congress to act quickly to approve the money.
