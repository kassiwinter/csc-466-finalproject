President Obama's decision to maintain foreign aid to Egypt -- at least for now -- is being disputed by some lawmakers in both parties."We need to suspend aid to the new government until it does in fact schedule elections and put in place a process that comes up with a new constitution," said Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who opposed Obama in the 2008 presidential election, also called for a cutoff of aid after the Egyptian military removed President Mohammed Morsi last week and installed an interim government."Regardless of what anyone thinks about Mohammed Morsi, he was elected by a majority of Egyptians last year," McCain said.The White House, meanwhile, is reviewing last week's events to determine if it is the kind of "coup" that would legally require the end of aid. The law forbids assistance to countries in which an elected leader is deposed by a military coup."It would not be in the best interest of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs to Egypt," said White House spokesman Jay Carney.The U.S. provides about $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt.Carney also said "this is a complex and difficult issue with significant consequences," and noted that millions of Egyptians backed the military in Morsi's removal.Other members of Congress -- such as Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations -- agree with the administration that it's too early to cut off Egypt.
