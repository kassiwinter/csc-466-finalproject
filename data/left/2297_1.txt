Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz panned Bernie Sanders' response to reports of violence at the Nevada Democratic state convention over the weekend, calling it "anything but acceptable." Wasserman Schultz was speaking on CNN on Tuesday night, after a day in which the Sanders campaign exchanged pointed public statements with the DNC and the Nevada Democratic Party over allegations that the campaign encouraged "extra-parliamentary behavior â€” indeed, actual violence" at the convention, in the words of the state Democratic Party.The DNC chairwoman was asked whether she had spoken with Sanders on Tuesday about the convention. She said she had not but that Sanders' 10-minute discussion with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was sufficient. "I was comfortable that one conversation was enough," Wasserman Schultz said during the interview. "Unfortunately, the senator's response was anything but acceptable. It certainly did not condemn the supporters for the violence and added more fuel to the fire."After the DNC and the Nevada Democratic Party said that Sanders needed to publicly denounce his supporters' conduct at the convention, the Vermont senator accused party leaders of favoring Clinton's campaign over his. "If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned," Sanders said in his statement. Chaos ensued Saturday in Nevada after Sanders supporters became incensed at the idea that the senator was being treated unfairly in the delegate allocation process.
