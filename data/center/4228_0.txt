WASHINGTON—House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        faces a narrowing set of options to avert growing calls within her Democratic caucus for the initiation of impeachment proceedings against President Trump.Mrs. Pelosi has fended off such calls for months, counseling patience and assuring lawmakers that the full suite of oversight tools in the House’s arsenal would be the best course to hold Mr. Trump to account for efforts to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. She has also warned of the electoral risks for Democrats of launching an impeachment inquiry. But Tuesday’s escalation in the battle between the executive and legislative branches—the defiance of a House Judiciary Committee subpoena by former White House counsel         Don McGahn,    on Mr. Trump’s orders—pushed some key Democrats further down the path toward impeachment.      “I think we’re at an inflection point,” said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D., Pa.), the vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who on Tuesday announced that she supported beginning an impeachment inquiry. “We’re no longer just dealing with a president who obstructed the Mueller inquiry. He’s now obstructing Congress at every turn.”                Behind closed doors Monday night, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) laid out the strategic advantages of formally opening an impeachment inquiry, according to a person in the room. Some lawmakers believe that starting the impeachment process, a power explicitly granted to the House in the U.S. Constitution, could put House Democrats in a stronger position in court to overcome the Trump administration’s attempts to resist congressional subpoenas.      Mrs. Pelosi and her leadership lieutenants pushed back against that suggestion, and she will make her case again Wednesday morning at a caucus-wide meeting to discuss the current state of the House’s multiple efforts to investigate Mr. Trump. Their options include holding Mr. McGahn and Attorney General         William Barr,    who has refused to hand over the unredacted report from Mr. Mueller, in contempt.

Mrs. Pelosi has warned that Democrats risk overshadowing the bread-and-butter issues that her party is expected to rely on in the 2020 elections, and that Mr. Trump was “goading us to impeach him.” In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released in early May, 49% of registered voters said Congress shouldn’t hold impeachment hearings for Mr. Trump, while 17% said hearings should begin, and 32% said Congress should keep investigating.     Even if the House were to impeach Mr. Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would be highly unlikely to convict him.

Karen Bass    (D., Calif.), a member of the Judiciary panel and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. “When you’re dealing with a completely lawless administration, then at some point in time you’re going to have to act. I would not act today, but that doesn’t mean we’re not going to be forced to act very soon.”     Republicans say that Democrats are re-litigating the same issues that the Mueller probe examined, in an effort to damage Mr. Trump politically. “Here we go again. The theater is open,” said         Rep. Doug Collins    of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, at the hearing Tuesday. “There was no collusion. There was no obstruction charges. There’s nothing here.”     Impeachment—a form of indictment that is a precursor to removing a president from office—is the most politically momentous step that the House can take, and one laden with peril. A GOP effort to remove President Clinton from office backfired in the late 1990s, when voters punished Republicans at the polls and the Senate subsequently failed to convict him.      The epicenter of the current drive towards impeachment is the House Judiciary panel, where Democrats were further aggravated Tuesday by the failure to appear by Mr. McGahn, who spoke for many hours to Mr. Mueller’s investigators.                                                 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler speaks at Tuesday’s hearing.

He didn’t provide specific details on his next steps.     But an expected next move is for the House Judiciary Committee to vote to recommend that the House hold Mr. McGahn in contempt, repeating an action that the panel already took against Mr. Barr.      Separately on Tuesday, the Judiciary panel issued subpoenas to former White House communications director         Hope Hicks,    and to Annie Donaldson, who served as Mr. McGahn’s chief of staff. Both Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson spoke to Mr. Mueller’s investigators, and Ms. Donaldson kept notes during her tenure at the White House. Ms. Donaldson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Ms. Hicks declined to comment.     While the Mueller report didn’t establish there was a conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia to affect the 2016 election results, it said Mr. Trump made several efforts to impede the special counsel’s probe, including instructing Mr. McGahn to have Mr. Mueller removed. Mr. Mueller decided not to pursue an obstruction charge against Mr. Trump, citing in part Justice Department guidance that a sitting president can’t be indicted.     Democrats on the House Judiciary panel and Mr. Mueller haven’t reached an agreement over how much of his potential testimony before the panel may be public or behind closed doors, according to a person familiar with the continuing talks. Mr. Mueller’s team is in part concerned about a public testimony devolving into a partisan shouting match, the person said.     Opening an impeachment inquiry could allow House Democrats to more easily overcome the Trump administration’s efforts to not comply with congressional investigations. “By focusing on impeachment, it would be armor-plating every inquiry,” said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington who has represented clients in impeachment inquiries.
