Authored by Paul Jospeh Watson via Summit News,Facebook-owned Instagram has announced that will ban all QAnon accounts, including ones that don’t promote violence, while refusing to remove ISIS propaganda accounts that celebrate 9/11 under the justification that “people may express themselves differently.”In an update to its policy announced yesterday, Facebook said that it was moving beyond a measure taken back in August that removed QAnon accounts which contained “discussions of potential violence.”“We’ve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by certain groups, which diverted attention of local officials from fighting the fires,” said the social media giant.Facebook specified that it would “remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content.”Many pointed out the hypocrisy of Antifa accounts still being allowed on the platform despite the movement’s involvement in numerous violent riots over the last six months.But not Antifa, even though they're literally a terrorist organization with cells in every major city, complete with uniforms and flags. https://t.co/mQAewCzGKW
— Mark Dice (@MarkDice) October 6, 2020While banning all QAnon content, Instagram has simultaneously refused to remove literal ISIS propaganda accounts that celebrate 9/11.As the Sun reveals, one such account posted an image of the World Trade Center being hit by a plane along with the caption, “One of the most beautiful scenes.”As recently as Sunday the Abogasm_1990 account posted an execution clip, and was followed by “20 other pro-IS accounts with more than 7,700 followers.”However, even after The Center for Countering Digital Hate reported the accounts to Instagram, the social media network refused to remove them, saying no breach of guidelines had occurred.Partially defending the content, Instagram explained that as “a global community we understand people may express themselves differently.”“It is unbelievably irresponsible, but sadly unsurprising,” said CCDH chief exec Imran Ahmed.So mere discussion of QAnon is completely banned, but actual glorification of terror attacks against the United States are just part of free speech, according to Instagram.* * *In the age of mass Silicon Valley censorship It is crucial that we stay in touch.
