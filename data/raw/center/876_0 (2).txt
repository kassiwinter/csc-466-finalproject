The U.S. job market chalked up solid progress in June, bolstering evidence that the economy might be strong enough to grow with less help from the Federal Reserve and sending bond investors rushing to sell.American employers added 195,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said Friday, and tallies for April and May climbed by a combined 70,000. Wages rose, the report said, and many of the jobs added were service ones such as store clerks and restaurant waiters. The jobless rate, derived from a separate survey, held steady at 7.6%. Employers have now added an average of more than 200,000 jobs a month this year. The gains are respectable but not enough to dramatically shrink the unemployment rate.                                                                                                                                                     Still, Friday's labor data deepened expectations that the Fed will start to slow its bond-buying stimulus in September. That rattled the bond market, where many investors already have suffered losses since May because of rising interest rates.               The Fed has been buying $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage bonds each month, boosting prices and tamping down yields across fixed-income markets. Investors fear how far prices will fall and yields will rise when the Fed stops buying, and labor-market data is the key indicator the central bank is monitoring.     In the first eight minutes after release of the jobs report, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose by 0.10 percentage point—a spike in the normally placid government bond market—and continued to rise to 2.718%, the highest level since August 2011.     "A huge bond bubble was created, and that will take some time to resolve itself," said         Tom di Galoma,    head of fixed-income rates sales at ED & F Man Capital Markets Ltd. in New York.                                                 The U.S. added 195,000 jobs in June as the recovery shows signs of growing with less Fed assistance. Here, a paperboard plant in Baltimore, Ohio.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Investors saw stronger-than-expected job gains as further proof that the Fed is on track to begin to tapering its massive bond-buying program later this year. But some skeptics wonder if the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates, which already are pushing up borrowing costs for companies and consumers.     Rates on a 30-year mortgage have climbed from 3.45% in April to more than 4% in June, according to         Freddie Mac.    The 30-day average yield on new bonds sold by companies with "junk" credit ratings hit 7.72% in June, up from 5.79% in April, according to S&P Capital IQ LCD.     Friday's bond-market turbulence could drive more cash out of the bond market, said Gregory Nassour, manager of a $45 billion mutual fund at Vanguard Group Inc. that buys short-term, investment-grade bonds. Last month, investors in bond-focused mutual funds withdrew about $60 billion from such funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.

U.S. stocks declined Friday morning but rebounded later in the day as traders focused on fresh signs of strength in the U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 147.29 points, or 0.98%, to 15135.84.      "The labor market is looking up," said         Eric Lascelles,    chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. "Overall, I think you're really splitting hairs if you come away with anything but a positive conclusion from this one."                                         The Labor Department's strong June employment report—the addition of 195,000 jobs — has improved the odds the Federal Reserve will begin to pull back on its $85 billion-per-month bond-buying program by the end of 2013. WSJ's Sudeep Reddy explains.                                                                                                     Manufacturer and software designer Proto Labs Inc. is among those hiring. Chief Executive         Bradley Cleveland    said the Maple Plain, Minn., company, which also has operations in Europe and Japan, is "setting records for orders and revenue." Through March, Proto Labs had 649 employees world-wide and is looking to fill 32 openings.     Despite making steady progress in 2013, the job market has seen its four-year recovery from the recession move at a glacial pace. The severity of the 2007-09 downturn—the U.S. lost millions of jobs and the unemployment rate surged at one point to 10%—has translated into a slow comeback that has yet to significantly whittle the ranks of the long-term unemployed.          Although June's estimates will be revised in coming months, the initial reading included a host of positive signals. Average hourly earnings for private employees, which translate into spending power for consumers, climbed 10 cents to $24.01, up 2.2% from a year ago.      However, that may have more to do with overtime pay than real wage increases, said         Peter Cappelli,    a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and director of its Center for Human Resources. The Labor Department distinguishes regular pay from overtime only for manufacturing jobs.      "I don't see a lot of wage pressure yet on the economy," Mr. Cappelli said. "No one's talking about raising wages."      The labor-force participation rate edged up to 63.5% from 63.4%, signaling that more people may have perceived better prospects and entered the job market.      While a rising labor-force participation rate implies greater confidence, it also creates "a little bit of dilemma" for Fed policy makers, said         Kevin Logan,    chief U.S. economist at HSBC Bank in New York, because "if the labor-force participation rate starts to increase, that would tend to" keep the unemployment rate from falling swiftly.           
A Historical ViewU.S. unemployment since 1948                    Mike Starich,    president of Orion International Consulting Group LLC, which places former members of the military in jobs, says companies are cautious, but they continue to hire strategically. Business for the Cary, N.C., recruiting firm has been flat in 2013, he said, compared with customary 10% year-over-year growth. However, things have been gathering steam in the past two months, he said.     Orion places workers in industries including oil and gas, power generation, utilities and manufacturing. One bright spot has been wind energy. The business "really evaporated" in 2012, but is growing now and likely to get "a lot healthier" in 2014, Mr. Starich said. Orion is supplying mechanics and electricians to maintain and service wind turbines run by three large operators.     Hiring gains in sectors were broad-based, powered by leisure and hospitality, retail and health care. Temporary-help services, often seen as a hiring bellwether, added positions. An improving housing sector helped spur jobs in construction.      Overall government jobs contracted, with federal and state losses more than countering gains at the local level. Some economists saw only mild effects of the so-called sequester—the sweeping federal budget cuts that were triggered in March—in the job numbers. Manufacturing jobs, which fell in May, declined again in June.                                                                                                                                                      "I think the economy has been incredibly resilient," said         Andrew Wilkinson,    chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. Factors that likely hindered employment growth during the first half of 2013 included the sequester, tax increases in January, as well as fiscal turmoil in the euro zone and pockets of weakness in Asia. "A lot of the headwinds facing employers are now known," Mr. Wilkinson said. "I don't think that they will put off their hiring intentions much longer."     Such optimism is building at Bremen Castings Inc., said         J.B. Brown,    president of the Bremen, Ind., company. "We're seeing a lot" of inquiries come in about new business, he said, even though "we're not as busy as we were."      Bremen, a family-owned foundry and machine shop, makes metal parts for agricultural machinery, heavy trucks, railroad equipment, lawn mowers and other purposes. The firm's workforce numbers 262, compared with a peak of 310 in August.      "We are down people because it has been a little slow," Mr. Brown said. But he is actively seeking management and technical workers, because it is hard to find and retain both. "We have plenty of ads out there now," he said. "We're always looking for good people. We'll snap them up."      Write to         Brenda Cronin at brenda.cronin@wsj.com and Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
