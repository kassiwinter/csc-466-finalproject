WASHINGTON—President Biden ordered a U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, following renewed scrutiny of the possibility that the outbreak of the virus might have started with a laboratory leak in China.The White House has come under pressure to carry out its own investigation after China told the World Health Organization that it considered Beijing’s part of the investigation complete, calling for efforts to trace the virus’s origins to shift into other countries. Mr. Biden, who wants a report within 90 days, said that U.S. intelligence has focused on two scenarios—whether the coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. He said that there is a divergence among officials in the American intelligence community, or IC, on how the virus might have emerged.     “While two elements in the IC lean toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter—each with low or moderate confidence—the majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,” Mr. Biden said in a statement Wednesday. He refrained from outlining the positions of specific intelligence agencies.          The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday on a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care.

The first officially documented case of a Covid-19 infection was in early December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. So the timing of the intelligence about the sick researchers, if fully corroborated by the new investigation, is deemed by current and former U.S. officials to be potentially significant.      “I have now asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days,” Mr. Biden said. “As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China.”     In the coronavirus pandemic, more than 590,000 Americans have died, out of some 3.4 million deaths world-wide, though officials say the count may be much higher.     Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman         Zhao Lijian    said at a regular press briefing on Thursday that “the theory that the virus was leaked from a Chinese lab is ‘very unlikely,’ and this was clearly written in the WHO joint research report. This is an authoritative, formal and scientific conclusion.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is the target of a smear campaign on the virus’s origins, though it didn’t say by whom.                                         The World Health Organization’s mission to Wuhan said the coronavirus most likely spread naturally to humans through an animal.

A WHO-led team of scientists visited China earlier this year to explore the origin of the virus and afterward called a lab accident “extremely unlikely.” Still, with the other origins hypothesis—that the virus spread from animals to humans—undocumented, some scientists, some governments and the head of the WHO have urged further investigation into the possibility of a lab leak.     China told the WHO’s decision-making body on Tuesday that its portion of the origin-tracing study was finished and the focus should turn to other countries. At that meeting         Xavier Becerra,    the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, pressed the WHO to oversee a second round of studies under rules that “give international experts the independence to fully assess the origins of the virus.” He didn’t specifically mention a lab.     Some former U.S. officials said that it could be challenging to conduct a thorough inquiry without additional information from China on research that was going on at the Wuhan institute of Virology, or WIV, the medical records of staff there and more information on whether the virus might have been circulating in Wuhan earlier than the first confirmed cases in December 2019.      “President Biden’s directive to the intelligence community is important, but it does not explain how the intelligence agencies can arrive at a definitive conclusion when China is hiding the data,” said Anthony Ruggiero, the top National Security Council official for biodefense during the Trump administration and a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a conservative think tank.      U.S. intelligence agencies have long failed to make the detection of international pandemics a priority, according to former officials, though aides to Mr. Biden said last year that they planned to ask the intelligence community to give new emphasis to global issues.      But Andrew Weber, who served during the Obama administration as the assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said that it was noteworthy that Mr. Biden had asked U.S. government laboratories to contribute to the intelligence inquiry.     “The labs have deep biological expertise, especially Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,” added Mr. Weber, who is now a consultant to that facility.        
More on the Covid-19 Pandemic        Another potential source of information for the inquiry Mr. Biden ordered is intelligence from friendly governments. On Monday, White House spokeswoman         Jen Psaki    said that the information that three Wuhan institute researchers had sought hospital care had come from a foreign entity and that the U.S. needed additional information to independently corroborate it.     The White House has also come under pressure from lawmakers to mount an inquiry. On Wednesday night, the Senate passed a bill introduced by Republican Sens.         Josh Hawley    of Missouri and         Mike Braun    of Indiana requiring the director of national intelligence to declassify information on the origin of Covid-19. Sens.         Robert Menendez    (D., N.J.) and         Jim Risch    (R., Idaho) have also sponsored legislation that calls on the administration to provide a detailed assessment on the origin of Covid-19 and work at the WIV, including any differing views among U.S. intelligence agencies.     Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said that China’s refusal to cooperate with international efforts to investigate the pandemic’s origin “can only delay” efforts to better understand the source of the coronavirus. He said it was important to have an objective assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies and underscored the need to “avoid any premature or politically motivated conclusions.”     During its visit to China earlier this year, the WHO team was largely confined to reviewing research conducted by Chinese scientists. Some members expressed frustration that they weren’t given full access to the data Chinese counterparts used to conclude there was little evidence of Covid-19 in China before the cases in December 2019.     In March, the WHO-led team recommended another, second phase of research, but that work has yet to begin.     Mr. Biden said Wednesday, “The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence.”     The White House declined to provide additional information Wednesday, including whether it would take action if China doesn’t participate in an inquiry.
