At least that’s premise of the Chicago-based company’s latest marketing stunt. The company says it has bought a plot of vacant land on the Mexican border and “retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.”  “Donald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans,” the company, founded by Max Temkin, wrote on its website. “He is so afraid that he wants to build a twenty-billion dollar wall that everyone knows will accomplish nothing.”  Temkin and his team asked fans of the game, which styles itself as “a party game for horrible people,” to send $15 to be part of the gag. Temkin wrote in a tweet that 150,000 donors signed up within nine hours of the campaign, which began Tuesday. Each will get a map of the land, a “certificate of our promise to fight the wall, some new cards, and a few other surprises,” the company said.   A mockumentary to promote the viral scheme on the Cards Against Humanity website refers to the plan as “a crazy holiday marketing campaign.”   The White House did not respond Wednesday. The offer to join the gag is sold out, according to Cards Against Humanity.  kjanssen@chicagotribune.com   Donald Trump          Latest News                Most Read
