Nebraska on Wednesday became the seventh state since 2007 to scrap the death penalty, the latest sign of weakening support for capital punishment in statehouses across the country.The move was driven by a bipartisan group of legislators, who argued that the death penalty had grown inefficient and ineffective. Nebraska hadn’t executed anyone since 1997, and until recently had struggled to get the drugs needed to carry out executions. On Tuesday, Republican Gov.         Pete Ricketts    —who lobbied to retain capital punishment in the state—vetoed a bill that would make a life sentence the stiffest available criminal penalty in the state.     But Wednesday afternoon, the state’s legislative house voted 30-19 to override the governor’s veto.               Sixteen Republicans joined with 13 Democrats and one independent in support of the override. All 19 votes in support of Mr. Ricketts’ veto were lodged by Republicans.     The vote shows how the politics around the death penalty have shifted in recent years, amid a spate of executions that haven’t gone as planned, shortages of drugs needed to carry out lethal injections, and fears that the system ensnares people who aren’t guilty.        
Previous Coverage        The vote makes the state the first in years under Republican control to abolish capital punishment, and exemplifies just how much conservatives’ thinking has changed on the topic.     Once universally hailed by conservatives as an indispensable tool for prosecutors, the death penalty is now also seen by many conservatives as a costly and unmanageable government program.     “It’s not pro-life, it’s not limited government, and doesn’t deter crime,” said         Marc Hyden,    a coordinator with Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, which was launched in 2013.     Americans are still broadly supportive of the death penalty. The most recent Gallup poll on the topic, from last year, revealed that 63% of Americans still support the death penalty’s use in murder convictions , a level consistent with those found in the last decade or so.     Death-penalty supporters in Nebraska advocated a “mend it, don’t end it” approach. “Repealing the death penalty sends the wrong message to Nebraskans who overwhelming support capital punishment and look to government to strengthen public safety, not weaken it,” said Mr. Ricketts in a statement following his veto Tuesday.     The repeal won't apply to the 10 inmates currently on death row in Nebraska. An 11th inmate died of natural causes on Sunday after spending 29 years in prison.     Thirty-two states currently have the power to sentence inmates to death. The number will fall to 31 later this year when the Nebraska repeal takes effect.      Since 2007, the death penalty has been abolished in six states—Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York. Governors in both Washington and Oregon have issued moratoriums on executions in recent years, citing concerns that the use of the death penalty is inconsistently administered. A bill that would have abolish the death penalty in Delaware failed in that state’s House earlier this month.      Thirty-two states currently have the power to sentence inmates to death.
