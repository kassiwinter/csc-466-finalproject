Opening a rare Sunday session of the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are continuing talks to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government--but gave no hint of progress in the negotiations."We’re in conversation today," Reid said on the Senate floor. "I’m confident the Republicans will allow the government to open and extend the ability of the county to pay its bills. And I'm going to do everything I can throughout the day to accomplish just this."
