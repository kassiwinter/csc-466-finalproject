WASHINGTON—Justice         Ruth Bader Ginsburg    underwent a heart procedure Wednesday after doctors discovered a blockage in her right coronary artery. Justice Ginsburg, 81 years old, “experienced discomfort during routine exercise” Tuesday night and was taken to the hospital, the Supreme Court said. A stent was placed in the artery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center. The court said she was released Thursday morning. A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Justice Ginsburg expects to return to the bench Monday, when the court hears its next cases.     Justice Ginsburg, a 1993 Clinton appointee, has experienced a variety of health problems during her tenure, including colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009. In each instance, she has recovered quickly and returned to her post without missing cases. She also suffered the loss of her husband, law professor Martin Ginsburg, in 2010, but was on the bench the next day.               On a court that generally discloses little information about personal matters, Justice Ginsburg often has been more forthcoming than most justices regarding her health, releasing regular updates during her most recent bout with cancer.     While she is the court’s eldest member, several of her colleagues aren’t far behind in age. Justices         Antonin Scalia    and         Anthony Kennedy,    both Reagan appointees, are 78, while Justice         Stephen Breyer,    a Clinton appointee, is 74.     Two justices who retired in the past decade,         Sandra Day O’Connor,    84, and         John Paul Stevens,    94, remain in apparent good health and maintain active schedules. But many justices have died in office, most recently Chief Justice         William Rehnquist,    who stayed on the bench even as thyroid cancer ravaged his body, succumbing in September 2005 at age 80.     Uncertainty over Justice Ginsburg’s health has prompted some liberal academics to urge her to retire, so that President Barack Obama might appoint a like-minded successor. In resisting those calls, she has chided liberals for believing a nominee with her record—she led the American Civil Liberties Union’s women’s rights project in the 1970s—could be confirmed by the Senate, which will pass to Republican control next month.     “Who do you think could be nominated and confirmed at this point in time that you would rather see on the court than me?” she said, in an October interview.                                          Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is recovering from a heart procedure. WSJ’s Jess Bravin discusses how the court may shift if Justice Ginsburg retires.

She has for years worked out with a personal trainer in the Supreme Court gymnasium. She felt chest pains during one of those sessions Tuesday night, leading to her hospitalization.     A stent is a tiny wire mesh device that is threaded into the heart via a catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist. It is deployed with a balloon to open a blockage and prop open a diseased coronary artery. It is generally used to relieve serious chest pain symptoms or to open an artery when a patient is suffering a major heart attack.      It is a widely used procedure with generally few complications. Patients typically are prescribed a dual blood-thinner regimen to reduce the risk of a clot forming within the device. Research presented earlier this month at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association suggested that at least 30 months of such treatment provides the best chance of avoiding future heart problems.     As a law professor and litigator, Justice Ginsburg was among the foremost advocates for women’s legal equality in the 1970s, helping win several landmark Supreme Court cases that pared back sex discrimination. She served 13 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. While there she developed a close friendship with an ideological opposite, her colleague then and now, Justice Scalia. She is the second woman, after Justice O’Connor, to sit on the high court.     On the Supreme Court, she has been a consistent liberal voice, and counts among her proudest achievements the 1996 decision requiring the public Virginia Military Institute to admit women. More recently, as the court has shifted to the right, Justice Ginsburg has emerged as the leader of the four-member liberal minority, writing strong dissents from rulings that have rolled back the Voting Rights Act and carving out religious exemptions for for-profit employers from Affordable Care Act regulations that require contraceptive coverage for women employees.     Although not known for an outsize personality like Justices Scalia or         Sonia Sotomayor,    Justice Ginsburg in recent years has maintained an active public schedule and attracted a minor Internet following, where she is portrayed in various guises by fans.
