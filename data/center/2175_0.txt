Regular order began returning for Democrats Saturday. Republicans still aren’t sure whether their version of regular order even exists any longer.The one thing that was settled as voters spoke in two states—Democrats in Nevada and Republicans in South Carolina—is that there now is no doubt about the identity of the front-runners in the 2016 presidential campaign.         Hillary Clinton    has re-established herself, as she was always supposed to, as the Democratic favorite. And whether Republican party leaders like it or not,      Donald Trump        now is indisputably the favorite to win the GOP nomination. On the Republican side, Mr. Trump continues to remake both the Republican party and what a winning coalition within it looks like. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, he enjoyed significant strength among blue-collar, non-college-educated voters in South Carolina. They used to be a GOP afterthought, but increasingly seem to be its core.          Meanwhile, there is little consolidation in the anti-Trump lanes, and still too many of them to suit party establishment figures eager to stop Mr. Trump. This is at least a three-man race going forward, with Mr. Trump joined by Sens.         Ted Cruz    of Texas and         Marco Rubio    of Florida. Technically, for now, it is actually a five-man race, with Ohio Gov.         John Kasich    and retired neurosurgeon         Ben Carson    hanging around.               Only former Florida Gov.         Jeb Bush    took South Carolina’s results as a signal to quit the race. Mr. Kasich should gird himself, though, for he is about to come under enormous pressure to do the same, to allow the anti-Trump vote to consolidate.          By the end of Saturday night, the reality was simply this: It isn’t clear who is the real alternative to Mr. Trump. South Carolina, with its large population of evangelical Christians, was supposed to be the ideal spot for Mr. Cruz, yet he failed to win. Mr. Rubio made a nice comeback from an embarrassing finish in New Hampshire, but he still hasn’t shown that he can actually win anywhere.     Big money and big establishment support will be flowing to Mr. Rubio in coming days; the establishment will effectively anoint him the alternative to Mr. Trump. In his post-South Carolina speech, he wrapped himself in the cloak of         Ronald Reagan,    and hit a generational-change note by declaring that he will lead the “children of Reagan” into a new era of conservative power. But it is far from clear that will be enough.     For the Democrats, the situation is more simple. Mrs. Clinton didn’t win Nevada’s caucuses impressively, but she didn’t have to. She just had to avoid raising new—and damaging—questions about her viability before Democrats vote in South Carolina next week. She should win big there, because of a big African-American vote that is the foundation of her candidacy. Her opponent, Sen.         Bernie Sanders,    nearly conceded that state in his own concession speech Saturday.

On March 1, Democrats move on to a series of Southern states that simply don’t figure to be friendly territory for him. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia all vote that day, and in each of them the African-American share of the population tops 15%. Texas also rolls in on March 1, and a third of its population is Hispanic, and that also figures to be a friendly Clinton audience.     Less obviously, Nevada suggested one other Clinton asset. Until now, being the establishment choice hasn’t been a good thing for much of this election cycle. But it proved to be in Nevada; older, more moderate, mainstream Democratic voters were the ones who showed up in force there for her.     Still, Mrs. Clinton continues to face the same problem she has had weighing her down since day one, which is voters’ lack of confidence in her honesty and integrity. As Democratic pollster         Peter Hart    put it to the Journal this week: “She is running against herself.”     Mr. Sanders still has an army of energized supporters and a surprisingly fat bankroll, and states he can win on March 1: Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota and perhaps even Oklahoma. So things are far from decided. But for the Democrats, unlike for Republicans, a return to something resembling normalcy at least seems possible.     Write to Gerald F.
