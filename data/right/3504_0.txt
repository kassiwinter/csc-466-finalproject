President Donald Trump called out Harley-Davidson for moving some of its production overseas due to tariffs placed on the U.S. by European countries.“Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse – be patient! #MAGA,” Trump tweeted Monday. Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag.
