The U.S. flew F-22 stealth fighter jets to South Korea Sunday for joint exercises, a further demonstration of advanced military capabilities meant to deter provocations from Pyongyang.The deployment comes amid an intensifying back-and-forth between Pyongyang and Washington, with North Korea issuing ever-more-pointed threats and the U.S. responding with its own tough language and displays of sophisticated hardware. In recent days,         Kim Jong Eun,    the young and outspoken leader of North Korea, has posed in front of maps portraying missile strikes on Hawaii and the mainland U.S. and has threatened to launch rockets at the U.S. and its bases in the Pacific. North Korea has said it is trying to place nuclear warheads on its missiles, but it isn't clear how far they have advanced in this effort.      Mr. Kim's behavior and the U.S. response, which come after a new government has just taken office in the South, amount to the Korean peninsula's tensest state in years. It drew a reference Sunday from Pope Francis, who in his first Easter message called for a spirit of reconciliation on the peninsula.                                          How far did B-2 stealth bombers travel for a "practice run" in South Korea? Why is North Korea threatening missile strikes against U.S. cities like Austin, Texas? WSJ's Jason Bellini has the Short Answer.                                                                                                     The arrival of the F-22 fighters follows U.S. displays of air power last week that included B-52 bombers and B-2 stealth bombers. The F-22s are ordinarily stationed in Japan at Kadena Air Base but flew to Osan Air Base in South Korea for the continuing exercises.          The F-22s, among the most expensive and advanced weapons in the Air Force's arsenal, are capable of evading radar and air-defense systems. The U.S. hasn't used them in combat but has deployed them in the United Arab Emirates and Japan as a deterrent against Iran and North Korea.     In a conflict with North Korea, F-22s would likely be the first aircraft used. The hard-to-detect fighters could be sent in to take out air defense missiles and radars in advance of bombers aimed at missile launch sites or other targets. They also could be used to escort nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers, should these be used in a strike.     The use of F-22s in the training exercise with South Korea, which the military calls the Republic of Korea or ROK, is a signal the U.S. is eager to showcase its most potent weaponry to North Korea.

"Despite challenges with fiscal constraints, training opportunities remain important to ensure U.S. forces are battle-ready and trained to employ airpower to deter aggression, defend the ROK and defeat any attack against the alliance," the U.S. military command in South Korea said in a statement. Earlier, U.S. defense officials had pledged further demonstrations of American military capability in the face of continuing threats from North Korea to attack the U.S., South Korea and allies in the Pacific.     The annual military exercises with South Korea have angered North Korea, particularly as the U.S. has put its most advanced capabilities on display. The B-2 stealth bomber flights over South Korea last week demonstrated the ability to deliver nuclear weapons from bases in the U.S.     Senior North Korean leaders are meeting this week, and U.S. officials are watching closely to see whether the North continues its threats to strike at American bases in the Pacific.     On Friday, North Korean state-run television announced Mr. Kim had signed off on war plans to attack the U.S. The government also appears to have organized a large protest in Pyongyang, where North Koreans held anti-American placards including ones that read "Death to the US imperialists."     North Korea on Saturday referred to entering a "state of war" with South Korea.      Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, called the tough statements out of Pyongyang "unconstructive." She said the U.S. remains prepared to defend its allies and is taking additional measures against the threat from North Korea.     "We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies," she said. "But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats."     The authoritarian regime's Supreme People's Assembly is set to convene for a single day on Monday to rubber-stamp budget and personnel decisions. Observers will study the personnel moves for indications of who the rising and falling stars are and how their profiles might indicate shifting influences on policy.     U.S. officials have said long-range North Korean missiles are capable of hitting Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories in the Pacific.     Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican who heads the House Homeland Security Committee and sits on the intelligence panel, said Sunday the greatest threat remains an attack by the North on South Korea or U.S. bases in the Pacific. He said Mr. Kim could be trapped by his own rhetoric into thinking he needs to attempt a strike.     "I think the real threat is to what North Korea might be boxing itself into," Mr. King said in an ABC News interview." He added: "Kim Jong Eun is trying to establish himself. He's trying to be the tough guy."     U.S. defense officials believe North Korea is following similar patterns as in the past, ratcheting up tensions in a ploy to begin direct bilateral talks with Washington or win more international aid. But Seoul has signaled it could respond more forcefully than in the past to any new North Korean military provocation.      Mr. King opposed direct talks with North Korea, saying he didn't "see any purpose" in them. "This is not even a government," he said. "It's sort of like an organized-crime family running a territory. He's brutal, his father is brutal, his grandfather was brutal."                                                 South Korean soldiers near the North Korean border on Sunday.

In addition to the bombers and fighters, the U.S. has said it would expand the number of ground-based interceptors it has deployed to counter long-range North Korean rockets.      The U.S. also is speeding deployment of additional advanced-warning radar in Japan and has drafted an extensive framework of possible responses for South Korea should its neighbor mount an attack or provocation.     Some administration officials have voiced reservations about the deployments of advanced U.S. bombers and fighters, arguing they risk further escalating the situation. But the South Korean government, U.S. officials have said, has asked for demonstrations of America's nuclear deterrence.      The current U.S.-South Korean exercises, known as Foal Eagle, are scheduled to continue for several more weeks.     Write to         Julian E.
