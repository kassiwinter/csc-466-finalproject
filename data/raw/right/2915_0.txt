    WASHINGTON – President Trump has tapped his daughter-in-law to combat “fake news” and broadcast only positive stories coming out of the White House.
Lara Trump, a former TV producer at “Inside Edition,” launched the first online broadcast Sunday and talked about the glowing week Trump had from donating his salary to education programs to a booming stock market.
“I’m Lara Trump and that is the real news,” she said at the end of a two-minute video posted on Trump’s Facebook page.
It appears the Trump news channel is produced by his reelection campaign as Lara Trump is speaking against the backdrop of his campaign website – DonaldJTrump.com.
Lara Trump, pregnant and married to middle son Eric, expressed frustration that more of the president’s accomplishments didn’t get into the spotlight.
“I bet you haven’t heard about all the accomplishments the president had this week because there is so much fake news out there,” Lara Trump said.
But it was a tough week for the administration.
Obamacare repeal failed, the new communications director went on a nasty tirade and was later dumped and Trump ousted his chief of staff.
Lara Trump is not a government employee. Her husband, Eric, runs the Trump Organization with Trump’s eldest son Donald Jr. The family have routinely relied on their vast social media followings to paint a rosy picture of the White House and the family’s successes.
Mayor de Blasio also tried to sidestep the traditional media by releasing a highly-produced musical video about all his 2016 accomplishments. But he came under harsh criticism for using his taxpayer-funded staff and Broadway performers to literally sing his praises about affordable housing and filling potholes.
“It’s not an ad. You can say it all day long. It’s not an ad,” de Blasio said to criticism he’s using taxpayer dollars for his reelection campaign.
There is no word yet on how often Lara Trump will produce “real news” segments.
