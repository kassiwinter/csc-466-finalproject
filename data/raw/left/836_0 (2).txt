Some top political appointees in the Obama administration are using secret government e-mail addresses, and several federal agenciesÂ have so far failed to disclose their addresses to the Associated Press despite a three-month old request, the AP reported Tuesday morning.Those making use of secret addresses include Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the wire service said.AP requested the addresses using a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year. The AP article published Tuesday morning says the Labor Department initially asked the wire service to pay $1 million to cover the cost of researching the request and providing the information that was being sought.
