      All-time heat records were shattered this week in Western states as temperatures rose 10 to 30 degrees above average and caught more than 40 million people in the sweltering weather.       Death Valley, California, reached 124 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, making it the hottest place in the country and, as experts suggested, perhaps the most blistering spot in the world. High temperatures in Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nevada, and Arizona also broke heat records.                                        Billings, Montana, broke its all-time heat record by 10 degrees, reaching 108 on thermometers. Similarly, Chula Vista, California, reached temperatures of 89 degrees, 13 degrees higher than its previous record.       'BE PREPARED': PHOENIX RESIDENTS WARNED OF RECORD HEAT WAVE AS TEMPERATURE TOPS 110 DEGREES      Much of the Western United States is under a drought warning. Nearly all of Utah is under an "exceptional drought" classification. Most of Arizona and California have "exceptional drought" and "extreme drought" warnings, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.       "High chances for records to be tied/broken the next several days," the National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote on Tuesday. "Extreme temperatures such as these can extract a heavy cost, from an economic and health perspective. Please stay safe."       The NWS referred to the jump in temperatures as "persistent and extreme." The government agency predicted the heat wave will continue over the next few days and urged residents to stay hydrated and remove children and pets from parked vehicles.       "The persistent and extreme heat wave being felt across the western U.S. is set to continue and even expand over the next couple of days. A strong upper-level ridge over the Southwest is expected to remain in place through Friday, while only slightly weakening," the NWS wrote on Wednesday.

Highs into the 110s and low 120s are likely throughout the Desert Southwest," officials added.       The conditions have also led parts of Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota to be under warnings for fire weather.                       Fire weather will remain active across the West today and tomorrow. Dry and windy conditions will lead to several areas of elevated fire weather. Another concern will be dry thunderstorm activity in the Southwest and central Rockies, which could promote fire starts in dry fuels. pic.twitter.com/rskRuYLHd9â€” NWS Storm Prediction Center (@NWSSPC) June 16, 2021
