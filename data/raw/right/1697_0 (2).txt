While President Barack Obama claimed that he found out about Hillary Clinton's private email from news reports (Presidents: they're just like us!), White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today that the president and Clinton had indeed exchanged emails using Clinton's private address.
“The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,” Earnest said. “I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.”
Earnest then attempted to explain away Obama's earlier comments, saying that just because the president claimed he had no idea about Clinton's email address does in fact not mean that they had not exchanged emails.
“The point that the president was making is not that he didn’t know Secretary Clinton’s email address, he did,” Earnest said. “But he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act.”
Now, call me crazy, but shouldn't the President of the United States be concerned with the possibility that his Secretary of State is potentially violating federal law? Given that Pres. Obama possesses degrees from some of the most prestigious universities in the country, I'm assuming he's capable of reading an email address. It's quite strange to me that neither he nor anyone else connected with Clinton's State Department bothered to question why she was using a non-governmental email address during her tenure.
This story may stink to high heaven, but I have a feeling it's only just beginning.
