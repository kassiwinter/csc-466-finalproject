                                                  President Trump, speaking at the White House on Tuesday, said he is bringing the economy back from the coronavirus slide.

The past week has brought a spate of difficult headlines for the Trump campaign. Polls continued to show him facing a large deficit against presumptive Democratic nominee      Joe Biden,        including a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll that gave Mr. Biden an 11-point advantage.      The summer resurgence of the coronavirus continued, and more school districts around the country showed unwillingness to fully open to in-person teaching this fall despite the president’s persistent urging that they do so. Public polling shows majorities disapproving of the president’s handling of the pandemic, as well as his handling of racial tensions.     With such trend lines running in the wrong direction, Mr. Trump nudged aside his campaign manager,         Brad Parscale,    and replaced him with his deputy, Bill Stepien.                                         The last time a Democratic president won in Texas was in 1976, but there are some early signs that the state could be competitive in this year’s elections. WSJ’s Gerald F. Seib explains.

In the Journal/NBC News poll, a 54% majority of voters said they approved of Mr. Trump’s handling of the economy, the highest reading yet registered on that question, and far above the 37% who approve of his handling of the virus and the 33% who approve of his handling of race relations.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWould an improving economy be enough to give President Trump a re-election victory? Join the conversation below.        Mr. Trump is playing to that strength. In a spontaneous and rambling White House monologue in which he essentially summarized his case for re-election, he said he is bringing the economy back from the coronavirus slide, extolled a rising stock market and said the election of Mr. Biden would bring a collapse in both.               In events at a UPS facility in Georgia and at the White House, Mr. Trump particularly emphasized his administration’s efforts to reduce regulations to speed business activity. In an accompanying fact sheet, the White House asserted that the president’s efforts have cut regulatory costs by $50 billion and will do so by at least that much again this year. The Trump team pointedly contrasted his deregulatory approach with the big initiative of the week from Mr. Biden: a $2 trillion proposal to combat climate change. The plan has grown from the $1.7 trillion version he proposed last summer—a sign the former vice president is feeling pressure from the left wing of his party to move faster and further on government initiatives to combat greenhouse gases.
