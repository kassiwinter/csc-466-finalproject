New Jersey police on Monday captured the man wanted in connection with a series of bombs placed around the New York City area as officials said no others are being sought in what they now call “an act of terror.”          Ahmad Khan Rahami    —who was born in Afghanistan and is a U.S. citizen—was taken into custody in Linden, N.J., after a gunfight with police who discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar. Mr. Rahami was shot in the leg and was being treated Monday afternoon at a Newark hospital, New Jersey officials said. During the shootout, one officer was shot in his bullet-resistant vest, while another was injured by broken glass. Announcing the arrest, New York Police Commissioner         James O’Neill    said, “It’s been an extremely busy two days... and it came out successful.’’                                         Elizabeth, N.J., Mayor Chris Bollwage explains how the family of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in bombings in New York and New Jersey this past weekend, first became familiar to officials when they opened a chicken restaurant in 2002.

New York City Mayor         Bill de Blasio    said authorities aren't pursuing other suspects, but said the city’s police would remain on high alert and urged the public to remain vigilant about unattended bags in public places.          “We have every reason to believe this was an act of terror,’’ Mr. de Blasio said.               William Sweeney,    the head of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said his agents haven't found evidence pointing to a terror cell operating in the area, but the probe continues to examine all aspects of Mr. Rahami’s life and contacts.     The FBI and New York Police Department had issued alerts Monday morning seeking the public’s help in finding the 28-year-old Mr. Rahami, who investigators believe was recorded on surveillance video near the site of Saturday’s blast—which injured 29 people in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood—and near a homemade bomb discovered four blocks away.     Mr. Rahami was also being sought in connection with a pipe bomb that detonated in Seaside Park, N.J., earlier that day. Officials said they had forensic evidence tying him to that bomb. No one was injured in that blast.                                         Police in Elizabeth, N.J., exchanged gunfire with Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in this weekend's bombings in both New York and New Jersey, before apprehending him Monday morning.

Mr. Rahami’s family lives in that northern New Jersey city, which is adjacent to Linden.     Officials said a key piece of evidence from one of the unexploded bombs—a fingerprint that matched to Mr. Rahami—helped them zero in on him by Sunday afternoon.     Investigators suspect Mr. Rahami realized Sunday that the FBI was closing in on him and tried to hide. They also believe he dumped a set of bombs outside the Elizabeth, N.J., train station as he sought to evade law enforcement, officials said.     Photos: Man Arrested in Connection With N.Y.

No one was injured by the blast.     The ‘’Wanted” poster issued by the FBI doesn’t explicitly call Mr. Rahami a suspect, but several law-enforcement officials say he is the person they believe is behind the bomb plot. The officials are working to determine if any other individuals may have been involved.

After Mr. Rahami was identified earlier Monday, authorities raided the home of the man’s family in northern New Jersey, officials said, one of several searches being conducted in the area as the terrorism investigation intensified.     In a fresh sign of the urgency officials feel in trying to stop additional bomb attacks, alerts were sent to New Yorkers’ cellphones urging them to contact authorities if they see Mr. Rahami or have any information about him.     The attacks—coming as world leaders gathered in New York City for the annual United Nations General Assembly meeting—heightened concern that similar assaults could be mounted elsewhere, especially in public places with large crowds that are difficult to protect.     In a tragic example of the difficulty in protecting crowds in a public place, a man dressed as a security guard in St. Cloud, Minn., injured nine people in knife attacks late Saturday at a shopping mall, police said. He was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer.     In televised remarks on Monday, President         Barack Obama    said that the investigation into bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend is moving rapidly and pledged full federal support to the governors of both states.     Mr. Obama said he has been closely monitoring the situation from New York, where he’s attending the U.N. meetings. While federal officials are investigating the stabbing in Minnesota as an act of terrorism, he said there is no connection between that incident and the bombings in New York and New Jersey.
