                                                                                                                                         President Trump called the latest spending bill “ridiculous” while complaining about border wall funding Thursday morning and demanded Republicans “finally get tough.”                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Trump demanded to know why border wall and security funds were left out of the newest bill, and how Congress planned on paying for it after the midterms. He also accused Democrats of “obstructing law enforcement and border security.”                                                                                                                                                      I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms? Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH!

A majority of the money — $647 billion — went to the Pentagon, which would include funds for a pay raise for troops.                                                                                                                                                                 Three other federal departments were funded by the bill. The Department of Health and Human Services received $90 billion of funding, the Education Department was given approximately $71 billion, and the Department of Labor got around $12 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Congress funded Mr. Trump’s border wall and security measures with their July bill, including $5 billion in funding from the House.                                                                                                                              At the beginning of September, Mr. Trump once again floated threats of shutting down the government if Democrats worked to prevent Congress from spending more on border security.                                                                                                                   • David Sherfinski contributed to this article.
