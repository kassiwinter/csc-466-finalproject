                                          President-elect Joe Biden received the first shot of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine during a televised event Monday.

After pushing up the long-sleeve shirt on his left arm, Mr. Biden received the first of two doses after top public health officials recommended that he be fully vaccinated before his Jan. 20 inauguration. He was joined by his wife, Jill Biden, who received the first course of the vaccine earlier in the day, his transition team said.      “We owe these folks an awful lot,” Mr. Biden said of the medical professionals at ChristianaCare Hospital in Newark, Del. Mr. Biden, wearing a black face mask, sat for the first course of the         Pfizer    -BioNTech vaccine near a sign that encouraged mask-wearing with the words: “Wearing is Caring.”     The president-elect’s inoculation came a week after the start of the first U.S. Covid-19 vaccinations, the most significant mass-immunization campaign since the 1950s.                Mr. Biden said he was “doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to worry about.”     Mr. Biden said President Trump’s administration “deserves some credit, getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed.” He said he hoped Americans would listen to medical experts and “wear masks during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Wear masks, social distance. And if you don’t have to travel, don’t travel.”     Vice President-elect      Kamala Harris        is scheduled to be vaccinated next week in preparation for the new administration.     Covid-19 Vaccines     Mr. Biden became the latest American leader to get the vaccination, following Vice President Mike Pence last week along with congressional leaders and other lawmakers. It remains unclear if Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump, both of whom contracted Covid-19 in the fall, will receive the vaccine in the coming weeks.      One of Mr. Biden’s incoming White House advisers tested positive for the virus last week. Mr. Biden’s transition team said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D., La.), who will serve as senior adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement, “was not in close contact” with Mr. Biden during a campaign trip to Georgia last week on behalf of two Democrats competing in the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections.

Dr. Fauci said last week that Mr. Biden should be vaccinated as soon as possible.     The federal government approved use of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner         BioNTech SE    earlier this month. U.S. health regulators cleared the use of         Moderna Inc.’s    Covid-19 vaccine Friday, a move that should increase the availability of supplies this week.     About 40 million doses are expected to be available this month and the initial doses are slated to go to the nation’s front-line health-care workers and elderly residents of long-term-care facilities. Much of the public won’t receive the shots until the spring or summer 2021.     Dr. Fauci was scheduled to get vaccinated Tuesday along with other Trump administration public health officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary         Alex Azar,    the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in a tweet.
