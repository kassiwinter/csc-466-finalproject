           Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is calling for Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to resign after she urged supporters to harass Trump administration officials, the Washington Examiner is reporting.
Biggs's call came in the form a resolution he introduced in the House to censure Waters and push her to apologize for her remarks.
Over the weekend, Waters said people should seek out Trump administration members out in public and shout them down. She echoed that call during a television interview.
"Rep. Waters comments could directly and unnecessarily lead to public unrest, physical violence, and physical injury," Biggs' resolution stated.
It said harassment is "never an acceptable method of disagreement." The resolution claimed Waters' comments "do not contribute anything positive to the public dialogue."
In the resolution, Biggs also said Waters should issue a statement that says, "physical violence and harassment is not an appropriate reaction for members of the public to express disagreement with their elected officials."
And it said she should resign so "an individual more befitting of the respect of the people of the United States" could represent her district.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
