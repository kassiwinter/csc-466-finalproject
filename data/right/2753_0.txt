By now, you've likely heard a thing or two about the election in Georgia's 6th district. The special election is being heralded as a test on the Trump administration (although it's probably not), and tensions are relatively high for Democrat Jon Ossoff. On Tuesday, voters learned a fun new twist about their candidate: he actually can't vote for himself as he doesn't live in the district.
While it's not required that a person live in the district they represent, this is kind of an amusing wrinkle to the whole story.
Appearing on CNN, Ossoff admitted that he doesn't live in the 6th district as the lives with his girlfriend of 12 years (!) while she goes to medical school at Emory. Ossoff did, however, grow up in the district and plans on moving there if he wins the election on Tuesday. The host of the show also made things slightly awkward by asking Ossoff when he plans on marrying his girlfriend.
And, for what it's worth, most of his money is coming from not only outside of the district, but outside of Georgia. But please, tell me more about how "politics is local."
.@ossoff, w/ 97% of money from out of Georgia, using the "all politics is local" phrase on CNN this morning is something elseâ€” Brent Scher (@BrentScher) April 18, 2017
If nobody achieves 50 percent of the vote, the election will go into a runoff in June.
