Donald Trump's spokesman acknowledged on Friday that the White House was now cheering U.S. job growth figures that Mr. Trump routinely dismissed on the campaign trail as misleading: "They may have been phony in the past," press secretary Sean Spicer said with a smile, "but it's very real now."Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) March 10, 2017     The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy had created 235,000 jobs in February, Mr. Trump's first full month in office, and the official unemployment rate had ticked down to 4.7%.          The job growth exceeded analysts' expectations and surpasses the average over the past three months, 209,000, and the 179,000 monthly pace September through November. The unemployment rate has now been consistently below 5% since April, and the U.S. economy has been adding jobs since October 2010.     Soon after the report was released, Mr. Spicer wrote on Twitter:     Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump     — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) March 10, 2017     The president himself retweeted from his personal account a message from the Drudge Report declaring: "GREAT AGAIN: +235,000."     During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump regularly dismissed the Department of Labor figures as "phony," suggesting they underrepresented the unemployment picture. He favored what he referred to as "real unemployment," which could be one of several alternative measures of labor underutilization that include discouraged workers not actively seeking employment and others marginally attached to the labor force. Those are higher than the official unemployment rate because they take into account more people who aren't working in fulltime jobs.     "You see what's happening with real unemployment, not the phony unemployment numbers that you read, real unemployment -- people that can't get jobs and have given up looking for jobs," Mr. Trump said in September in Waukesha, Wis.     In March, he said in an interview: "If you look at our phony numbers of 5% unemployment, even opponents would say that, and would agree to that fact that the jobs that we have are bad jobs."     In June 2015, in his speech announcing he was running for president, he said, "Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20%. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."     House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady made an even more stark about-face in his statement from this February's jobs report from that of a year earlier, when month-over-month job growth was even stronger, a point made by Sam Stein of the Huffington Post.     "This is a great report," the Texas Republican said in a statement promising that Mr. Trump and House Republicans would add to the momentum. "The fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction."     A year earlier, when the economy under Democratic President         Barack Obama    added 242,000 jobs, Mr. Brady wrote: "While it’s good news that more Americans have joined the labor force, it’s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages."     Asked at the Friday press briefing about Mr. Trump's past remarks, Mr. Spicer said that he had spoken to the president on the matter and Mr. Trump had asked him to pass along the message that the jobs numbers were phony under Mr. Obama but "very real" while he was in the White House.     Under Mr. Obama, the Democrats routinely cheered the good jobs news and the ever-growing record streak of job growth, while acknowledging the persistently low labor force participation and weak wage growth.     On Friday, newly installed Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez wrote: "Thanks, Obama! Trump has had about as much to do with job growth since January 20th as he does with the Washington Wizards’ winning record: absolutely nothing."
