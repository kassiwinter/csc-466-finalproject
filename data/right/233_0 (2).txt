White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed the G-7 in May, saying the WHO is the “appropriate body” for such an investigation. Biden has ordered the U.S. intelligence community to conduct a 90-day “review” of existing evidence on whether COVID-19 originated from a Chinese lab. The White House has said the U.S. review can happen alongside a potential WHO investigation. “This is something that was ongoing. This is something that has been going on since March. The WHO doing their thing and the I.C. doing what they’re doing currently is not mutually exclusive. This is something that can happen at the same time,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said May 27.
