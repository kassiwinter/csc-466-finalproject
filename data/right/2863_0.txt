President Trump's travel order will begin to go into effect Thursday, just a few days after the Supreme Court upheld parts of the controversial policy, which temporarily bars visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. The partial travel restrictions going into effect will have new rules for visa holders. Those seeking to visit the U.S. must prove they have a "close" relative here. Grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles don't count.Visas that have already been approved will not be revoked, but instructions issued by the State Department say that new applicants from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen must prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the U.S. to be eligible.Journalists, students, and workers who can prove they have invitations or employment contracts in the U.S. are exempt. Only those with "formal, documented" professional ties will be granted entry.Last week, Trump reversed an Obama era policy that sped up visa processing for applicants, leading The Hill to predict the 45th president is quietly enacting his "extreme vetting" agenda. The Supreme Court will hear the Trump travel ban case in October, which affects those traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Until then, considering how Trump's original travel order went into effect, airports are hoping Thursday's rollout will be a bit smoother.
