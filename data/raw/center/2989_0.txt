The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong.In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There have been a "number of people" injured, police saidMedia caption, Witnesses describe the explosion at Parsons GreenEmma Stevie, 27, who was on the train when the explosion happened, said she was caught in a "human stampede" and crush on the station steps as people rushed away from the train."I wedged myself in next to a railing, I put myself in the foetal position," she said."There was a pregnant woman underneath me, and I was trying really hard not to crush her."I saw a poor little boy with a smashed-in head and other injuries. It was horrible."Media caption, BBC presenter Sophie Raworth was near Parsons Green station minutes after the incident happenedAt Parsons GreenImage source, ReutersImage caption, Witnesses have described seeing at least one passenger with facial injuriesBy Jennifer Scott, BBC NewsLondon has again fallen victim to a terror attack, targeting commuters on their way to work and visitors venturing out into the city.With 22 people treated in hospital, this bustling part of zone two was left confused and shocked, waiting anxiously for an explanation. Olaniyi Shokumai was riding the Tube on the way to a training course, with his headphones plugged in and listening to music - just as he would on any other journey. After the train pulled into Parsons Green station, however, things became far from ordinary."I looked to my left and I saw lots of people running out. There were a lot of people just stamping on each other and I saw someone jumping over [them]."There was a woman on the floor and she couldn't breathe. I thought, 'This has got to be serious for people to do that.'"
