The vote was 232 to 197, with all Democrats joined by 10 Republicans, in a House chamber protected by National Guard troops stationed throughout the Capitol and its grounds. Democrats’ push to impeach Mr. Trump just before he is set to leave office reflects many lawmakers’ deep anger at Mr. Trump’s monthslong campaign to challenge the results of the election, making false claims about election fraud and trying to twist the arms of state officials as well as Vice President Mike Pence to stay in power, culminating in his supporters’ violent actions.     “We know that the president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion, against our country,” House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) said. “He must go—he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”               Republicans, some of whom criticized Mr. Trump’s actions, said Democrats were rushing to impeach because of their longstanding animosity toward the president and would just further divide the country.         Live Updates        House Minority Leader         Kevin McCarthy    (R., Calif.) said Mr. Trump “bears responsibility” for the Capitol riot but said he opposed impeachment, calling for censure instead. “A vote to impeach would further divide this nation, a vote to impeach will further fan the flames, the partisan division,” he said.     The Republican president on Wednesday urged his supporters not to engage in violence. He has accepted no responsibility for the Capitol riot and has denied wrongdoing, calling the efforts to remove him from office over his comments a continuation of what he has termed a Democratic witch hunt.     In video comments released on the White House Twitter account after the vote, Mr. Trump didn’t mention impeachment but called on Americans “to overcome the passions of the moment, and join together as one American people.” He also said his movement has no room for mob violence and asked followers to ease tensions ahead of the inauguration.          “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country, and no place in our movement,” he said.     In a statement Jan. 6 during the Capitol attack, in which he urged the rioters to go home, Mr. Trump said: “We love you, you’re very special.”     House Democrats’ article of impeachment accuses Mr. Trump of incitement of insurrection and alleges that he “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ‘If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.’”     The president and some aides watched the vote unfold on TV on Wednesday, an adviser said. Mr. Trump viewed the number of Republican votes for impeachment as not as bad as expected, according to people familiar with his thinking. Mr. Trump entered his final week without one of his closest confidantes,         Hope Hicks,    according to a person familiar with the matter. Her plans to leave predated the riot, the person said.     Rep.         Liz Cheney    (R., Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican, was the only member of her party’s leadership to back impeachment. The other Republicans who voted to impeach were geographically and ideologically diverse: Reps.         Anthony Gonzalez    of Ohio,         Jaime Herrera Beutler    of Washington,         Dan Newhouse    of Washington,         John Katko    of New York,         Adam Kinzinger    of Illinois,         Peter Meijer    of Michigan,         Tom Rice    of South Carolina,         Fred Upton    of Michigan and         David Valadao    of California.     The 10 votes from the minority party are the most for any presidential impeachment, topping the five Democrats who voted for some impeachment articles in         Bill Clinton’s    1998 impeachment.

The final congressional word on Mr. Trump’s legacy will rest in the hands of the Senate, set to be split 50-50 later this month, where a two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr. Trump. Some GOP senators have signaled they could join Democrats, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he hadn’t decided how to vote on the matter.     It isn’t known when a trial would start, though Mr. McConnell said any vote would take place after Mr. Biden becomes president on Jan. 20. If the Senate convicts Mr. Trump, it could also vote, at a lower threshold, to ban the president from ever seeking office again, as he has publicly contemplated.      In a statement late Wednesday, Mr. Biden didn’t take a position on Mr. Trump’s impeachment, though he called for those responsible for the violence to be held accountable. He also indicated that he doesn’t want impeachment to be Congress’s sole focus as his administration begins.      “This nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,” he said. “I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.”     Wednesday’s vote was held seven days after rioters invaded the Capitol building, halting the joint session of Congress held to certify Mr. Biden’s win and sending lawmakers and aides fleeing from the chambers with just moments to spare. The vote comes 13 months after Mr. Trump’s first impeachment in late 2019, over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden. No Republicans joined Democrats in voting for those two articles of impeachment, and only one GOP senator voted to convict, on one count. Mr. Trump denied wrongdoing.     The action marks the fastest impeachment vote assembled in the nation’s history and makes Mr. Trump the first president to be impeached in two separate proceedings. House Democrats introduced the article of impeachment Monday and passed it Wednesday after unsuccessfully urging Mr. Pence and members of the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to push Mr. Trump out of office.      Unlike past impeachments, there were no depositions or investigations by congressional committees. Instead, many lawmakers cited firsthand accounts of the attack, as well as public statements by the president, in arguing for impeachment, saying Congress must send a message.     “President Trump used a litany of lies about a stolen election, and willfully incited an armed insurrection with the intent of stopping the peaceful transfer of power,” said New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee.                                                  Members of the U.S. National Guard gathered on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol Tuesday.

Chip Roy (R., Texas) called the president’s actions impeachable, but said the article of impeachment was flawed and he would vote no.     “Let us condemn that which must be condemned and do so loudly,” he said on the House floor. “But let us do it the right way—with deliberation, and without disastrous side effects.”     But Ms. Cheney said the president’s actions demanded a stiff response. Mr. Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,” she said.      Reflecting the splits in the caucus, Ms. Cheney faced backlash from some GOP colleagues, who circulated a petition for a special meeting to determine whether she should step down from her leadership post. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), an influential conservative, said he was looking to see whether lawmakers could trigger a second vote on her leadership position. “I think she’s totally wrong,” he said.     Mr. Jordan said Democrats were trying to relitigate the 2016 election by doing a last-minute impeachment. “This is more than about impeaching the president of the United States. This is about canceling the president and canceling all the people you guys disagree with,” Mr. Jordan said to Democrats on the House floor Tuesday night.     In the 2019 impeachment, officials from the White House counsel’s and legislative affairs offices worked to rally votes against impeachment and formed a “war room” on the Hill with several lawmakers. But White House officials were notably absent ahead of Wednesday’s vote. White House counsel Pat Cipollone considered resigning in the wake of the riot, according to people familiar with the matter, and he and other top Trump advisers aren’t expected to serve on the president’s defense team for impeachment, one of the people said.     Since the riot last Wednesday, federal officials have said they were examining more than 160 cases and weighing sedition charges in some of them and are treating the breach like an international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation. A police officer and a rioter were killed in the rampage and three others died of medical emergencies.                                         VIDEO ANALYSIS | The Wall Street Journal analyzed hours of video and audio from the Capitol riot to better understand how a mob of thousands overran police and attacked the U.S. Capitol. Photo illustration: Laura Kammermann                                                                                                     Dozens of big U.S. companies, including         AT&T Inc.    and         Walmart Inc.,    have suspended political donations to Republicans who objected to last week’s certification of the results of the presidential election. The conservative Koch network’s Americans for Prosperity, and the affiliated super PAC, will evaluate future support of politicians based on their actions last week, its chief executive said. The riot interrupted the certification for several hours.     Following Wednesday’s vote, the case moves to the Senate. While Mr. McConnell made clear he doesn’t plan to start a trial immediately, it isn’t clear when it would start. The Constitution dictates that it begin the day after the House sends an impeachment article to the Senate. It wasn’t immediately known when the House would take that step.     Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.)—who will take control of the Senate later this month after two new Georgia senators are seated and Vice President-elect      Kamala Harris        becomes the tiebreaking vote—encouraged Mr. McConnell to call the Senate back early and said he plans to hold a trial even if Mr. Trump is out of office.     “Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again,” he said.     Mrs. Pelosi named nine impeachment managers on Tuesday night who would be in charge of taking the case to the Senate for an impeachment trial. The lead impeachment manager is Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who co-wrote the article the House passed on Wednesday.                                                 President Trump called on Americans ‘to overcome the passions of the moment, and join together as one American people.’                  Photo:            The White House                                                                                                             Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
