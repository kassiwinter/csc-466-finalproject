WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    is poised to nominate         Ashton Carter,    a former top Pentagon official known more as a technocrat than as a military strategist, to be the nation’s next defense secretary, according to administration and other government officials.The pick, defense officials say, signals more continuity than change in administration defense policy. Selecting Mr. Carter is among the least disruptive changes Mr. Obama could make. It would allow a former deputy secretary who understands the inner workings of the Pentagon to quickly take command of its sprawling bureaucracy. The move also comes after the top contender took herself out of the running for the job held by Defense Secretary         Chuck Hagel,    who was forced to announce last month that he is stepping down. Administration officials complained Mr. Hagel was disengaged from national-security debates, more comfortable with submitting memos than with participating in heated discussions. Defense officials said Mr. Hagel was frustrated with senior White House officials’ micromanaging his policy portfolio.     Mr. Carter, 60 years old, a summa cum laude graduate of Yale University and former Harvard University professor, will be far more comfortable wading into the intellectual debates that surround national-security decision making in the Obama administration, according to his friends and allies.               The installation of a defense secretary who is an expert on Pentagon budgets and procurement will likely solidify the position of Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as the most potent voice on military strategy in the Obama administration.     Gen. Dempsey’s cautious approach to the use of the military has helped shape the administration’s approach to fighting Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, a role he will likely continue to fill until his term ends in September.     Mr. Carter’s nomination could come later this week, and he will face questioning early next year from Sen.         John McCain    (R., Ariz.), the next chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.     On Tuesday, Mr. McCain said he was inclined to support Mr. Carter’s nomination. Mr. McCain noted the criticism that former defense secretaries         Robert Gates    and         Leon Panetta    have leveled at the White House, saying it micromanaged the military. Mr. McCain predicted similar frustrations for Mr. Carter.        
More        “I don’t see any difficulty—except that he understands he is the last man standing and he’ll have no influence on decisions affecting national security,” Mr. McCain said. “That’s all centered in the White House.”     The White House has repeatedly denied charges of micromanaging the Pentagon. Mr. Carter wasn’t available for comment.      There was a flurry of activity by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents last week as they vetted Mr. Carter for the top job, say people familiar with the matter, contributing to speculation that he was the top White House pick.     Administration officials cautioned that the choice of Mr. Carter hasn’t been finalized. Some of the customary vetting of his background still needs completing, they said, giving Mr. Obama a chance to potentially change his mind.     The White House’s leading candidate to succeed Mr. Hagel, former Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy, withdrew her name from consideration last month. Mr. Carter was named early on, along with Ms. Flournoy, as a potential choice, but after she bowed out, administration officials added other names to the list of potential successors to Mr. Hagel. They included former Navy Secretary         Richard Danzig    and former Assistant Secretary of State         Kurt Campbell.         Administration officials said deliberations over the next defense secretary were being held among a small group of the most senior aides to Mr. Obama, including White House Chief of Staff         Denis McDonough.         Mr. Carter has an intimate knowledge of how the Pentagon is run and will be able to begin working on an agenda quickly, according to people close to him. He may also bring a more casual style to the Pentagon. He has a fondness for chewing gum, and a distaste for neckties—a practice at odds with the formality of the Pentagon’s halls.     Mr. Carter’s expertise is different from the credentials the White House said last month it was seeking in its new Pentagon chief. Administration officials, including Press Secretary Josh Earnest, said Mr. Obama was replacing Mr. Hagel in part because he wasn’t the best person to lead the department as the war against Islamic State militants moved to the front burner.      While Mr. Carter has held Pentagon policy jobs in President         Bill Clinton’s    administration, he is better known for management, acquisition, and budget expertise than for war-fighting.     On Tuesday, Mr. Earnest talked up Mr. Carter, while stopping short of saying Mr. Obama had made a final decision. He said Mr. Carter fulfills the criteria Mr. Obama is seeking in a nominee and noted he received unanimous support during his last Senate confirmation.     Mr. Carter has a “detailed understanding” of how the Defense Department operates and deserves “strong bipartisan support,” Mr. Earnest said.     If chosen and then confirmed, Mr. Carter would face a host of challenges in the final years of the Obama administration, including combating Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, ending the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan and overseeing a shrinking Pentagon budget.     The choice of Mr. Carter is also expected to boost some of the initiatives championed by the current Pentagon deputy, Robert Work, including an effort to develop new strategies and technologies to preserve the U.S. advantage on the battlefield.     Mr. Carter has been in and out of government in a variety of roles. While out of government, he has served on number of advisory boards, providing counsel to both Democratic and Republican administrations.     Mr. Carter has worked closely with the only deputy defense secretary to rise to the top job,         William Perry,    who served in the Clinton administration.     In addition to his academic positions at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he has been a senior partner at the consulting firm Global Technology Partners and worked with the Aspen Strategy Group.     —Dion Nissenbaum and Janet Hook contributed to this article.
