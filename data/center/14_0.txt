A magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked Southern California Friday night, sending tremors that could be felt in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and nearly 400 miles north in Sacramento. The quake caused fires, power outages and collapsed buildings, officials said.The powerful quake struck around 8:20 p.m. local time and was centered near Ridgecrest, Calif., a community of 29,000 people on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada where a 6.4 temblor had hit Thursday morning. The latest quake lasted about 30 seconds and was the strongest in Southern California in 20 years. A series of aftershocks followed.          Mark Ghilarducci,    the director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said at a press conference Saturday that state officials didn’t yet have a full tally of injuries from the quake but most were minor to moderate. About 200 people stayed in shelters Friday night because of the earthquake and aftershocks, he said.      State and local emergency responders spent Saturday doing systematic assessments of property structures and checking for gas leaks in communities near the epicenter. Transportation officials have also been able to reopen roads that had been damaged or had closed because of rock slides.               The overall damage from the earthquake wasn’t as severe as what officials had anticipated.          “The damage that we are seeing this morning in the light is not as extensive as one could have expected,” Mr. Ghilarducci said. Still officials were monitoring the weather to ensure that wildfires wouldn’t break out.      In response to Friday’s quake, Gov. Gavin Newsom formally requested a presidential emergency declaration for direct federal assistance to aid the affected communities.     The governor also declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County, where Trona, a community of about 1,800 people, is located. The town, about 25 miles east of Ridgecrest, suffered significant damage and fires in Friday’s earthquake, according to state and local officials. The governor had previously declared a state of emergency for Kern County, where Ridgecrest resides, after Thursday’s quake.     “On behalf of all Californians, I offer my heartfelt support to those affected by tonight’s earthquake near Ridgecrest,“ the governor said in a statement Friday night. ”The State of California will continue to offer support to aid residents in the region.”     Over the next week there is a 3% chance that an even more powerful earthquake could come and an 11% chance that an earthquake nearly as powerful could come, said Robert de Groot, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey.      “It’s called stress transfer, if you release stress somewhere you increase it somewhere else,” Mr. de Groot said.     USGS said in a statement Saturday that millions of people in the region felt the shaking from the latest quake. The federal agency said it issued a red alert for economic losses from the quake, estimating the financial toll to be at least $1 billion. Past events with this alert level have required a national- or international-level response, according to the USGS.

Friday’s quake rocked buildings in Los Angeles, interrupted a Los Angeles Dodgers game and led Disneyland to evacuate rides.     Kashawn Cole, 33 years old, said she, her husband and her two children left their home in Trona after the quake on Friday and drove to her brother’s home in Ridgecrest.      “I was sitting outside when the quake hit,” she said in an interview Saturday. “I watched as cracks broke on my yard.”     Ms. Cole said her home was damaged and she had no power or water. She doesn’t plan on going back home.     “I don’t want to go back. I love Trona, but it’s the earthquakes,” she said. “My children are terrified.”     Kern County Fire Department Chief David Witt said during a press conference Saturday that local responders were going from house to house in Ridgecrest to inspect properties, but so far they hadn’t found major collapses or anyone trapped.           “We do feel like there is damage but we don’t know the extent of it yet,” he said.     In a press conference Friday night, Chief Witt said that his department had been inundated with emergency calls for medical assistance but so far there had been no fatalities. At least 1,800 people were without power in the area, he said.     Mr. Ghilarducci said Saturday that most of Ridgecrest’s power had been restored but Trona was still suffering extensive outages.     University of Michigan Prof. Ben van der Pluijm, who teaches in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science, said the two earthquakes are related but occurred within two nearby fault systems. That may explain why two relatively large quakes happened in such a short period time.     “Usually an earthquake releases energy and it takes a while to build up again,” he said. “This certainly surprised many of us.”     The activity doesn’t indicate a higher risk for a very large earthquake along the San Andreas fault which is about 100 miles west from the eastern California shear zone, where these took place.     —James Fanelli contributed to this article.
