                 | August 27, 2019 08:39 AM                 | Updated Aug 27, 2019, 02:36 PM                 As fires rage in the Amazon rainforest, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration rejected $20 million in aid from the G-7 that was pledged to fight them.       Bolsonaro’s chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, suggested that the funds be used elsewhere.             “We are thankful, but maybe those resources would be more relevant to reforest Europe,” the 64-year-old Lorenzoni is quoted as saying.       French President Emmanuel Macron has been outspoken about the need for the international community to coalesce around helping fight the blazes, which are up 84% from last year, according to the Brazil’s own space agency. During the G-7 summit, a gathering of representatives from the world’s seven largest economies, Macron announced it was making $20 million in aid available to the country to fight the fires.       Bolsonaro criticized the idea of international aid and said he worried it would signal an attack on his country’s sovereignty. He said an alliance would be denigrating Brazil to “a colony or no man's land.”       Lorenzoni further mocked Macron, 41, over France’s own highly publicized fire that partially gutted the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.       “Macron is unable to avoid a preventable fire in a church that is at a World Heritage Site and he wants to show us what is for our country? He has a lot to look after at home and the French colonies,” Lorenzoni said. “Brazil is a democratic nation, free and never had colonial or imperialistic practices which might be [the] objective of Frenchman Macron.”       Protests broke out in countries across the world recently in response to Bolsonaro’s handling of the fires. Bolsonaro drew considerable backlash after he made baseless claims that environmental groups and nongovernmental organizations might have set the blazes.       Local media in Brazil has reported that farmers, feeling emboldened by the government’s looser oversight of the environment, have set fires to clear land for further development. In addition to an increase in fires, there has been an escalation of deforestation in the South American country.       UPDATE: Bolsonaro didn't completely close the door on accepting the aid while speaking to reporters Tuesday. After reporters asked him about Lorenzoni's comments, Bolsonaro questioned, “Did I say that? Did I?”       “First of all, Macron has to withdraw his insults. He called me a liar. Before we talk or accept anything from France ... he must withdraw these words then we can talk,” Bolsonaro said, according to Reuters. “First he withdraws, then offers (aid), then I will answer.”       President Trump tweeted support for Bolsonaro and claimed that the Brazilian leader was working to combat the fires.       "I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!"
