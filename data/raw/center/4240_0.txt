WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court sidestepped major abortion cases Tuesday, letting stand a lower-court ruling that Indiana can’t ban abortions for the purpose of selecting sex or race, or to avoid having a disabled child. It did, however, allow the state to regulate the disposal of fetal remains.The court’s unsigned opinion appeared the product of a delicate compromise over perhaps the most divisive issue on the docket—one that has resonated more loudly since the majority’s position on abortion fell into question following the retirement last year of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who had joined liberals to reaffirm women’s constitutional right to end their pregnancies. With President Trump’s appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Kennedy seat, opponents of abortion rights have accelerated efforts to restrict the procedure, with some hoping the court may be ready to overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing abortion rights.     In recent months, lawmakers in several Republican-led states have proposed bills that are designed to challenge Roe in court, and governors have been more willing to sign them. Alabama enacted a near-total ban on abortion, with an exception that applies only when a woman faces a serious health risk; the Legislature rejected exceptions for victims of rape or incest. And four Southern states plus Ohio have banned abortions after six to eight weeks of pregnancy, or when a fetal heartbeat can be detected.               On Tuesday, days after Missouri’s GOP governor signed a bill banning abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood said its St. Louis facility, the state’s only abortion clinic, may have to close if the state health department doesn’t renew its license on Friday. The health department had no comment.        
Share Your ThoughtsWhat do you think of the Supreme Court justices’ evident caution, to date, in taking on major abortion cases? Join the conversation below.        The Supreme Court isn’t likely to rule on those new laws anytime soon, but several abortion cases are in the pipeline that could lead to a major ruling as early as next year.      Tuesday’s decision stressed that the justices weren’t ready—for now—to consider whether either Indiana law violates the Constitution, much less whether Roe should stand. Instead, the three-page opinion offered procedural reasons for the different, if perhaps temporary, outcomes for each provision.     Justice Clarence Thomas, writing separately, made that point. “Although the court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever,” he wrote.     Tuesday’s case stems from legislation signed in March 2016 by then-         Gov. Mike Pence,    now the vice president. Last year, in a suit brought by Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, the Chicago-based Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the two provisions unconstitutional.     Mr. Pence’s office issued a statement commending the court “for upholding a portion of Indiana law that safeguards the sanctity of human life by requiring that remains of aborted babies be treated with respect and dignity.”     “We remain hopeful that at a later date the Supreme Court will review one of numerous state laws across the U.S. that bar abortion based on sex, race, or disability,” the statement continued. “Countries across the globe prohibit selective abortion—and the United States should do the same.”     Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, criticized the Indiana law, saying: “While this ruling is limited, the law is part of a larger trend of state laws designed to stigmatize and drive abortion care out of reach. Whether it’s a total ban or a law designed to shut down clinics, politicians are lining up to decimate access to abortion.”     A previous Indiana law gave women “the right to determine the final disposition of the aborted fetus.” If they left that task to the abortion facility, it was required to bury the remains or cremate them by “incineration by a crematory, or incineration as authorized for infectious and pathological waste.”     The 2016 bill restricted the latter option. In legal filings, Indiana said the measure was based on the state’s “moral and scientific judgment that a fetus is a human being who should be given a dignified and respectful burial and cremation.”     The Seventh Circuit said the regulation was based on an erroneous premise, in that Roe v. Wade had determined that “the word ‘person,’ as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the unborn.” For that reason, it found, “the State’s interest in requiring abortion providers to dispose of aborted fetuses in the same manner as human remains is not legitimate.”

But while the Indiana law might survive that test, the court said it could be vulnerable under another—that it imposes an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to an abortion, the standard set out by the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was seen then as a compromise that narrowed abortion rights without overruling Roe.     Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote separately to say the court should have let the Seventh Circuit decision stand, as the result likely would be the same under the undue-burden approach. She cited an opinion by the Seventh Circuit’s chief judge, Diane Wood, who noted the disposal requirement could impose “a higher out-of-pocket dollar price for the procedure” and chill women from seeking abortions “because of the potential stigmatizing impact of these measures.”                                         The president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen, criticizes President Trump for his statements on late-term abortions, in a conversation at the WSJ Future of Everything Festival in New York City.                                                                                                     Justice         Sonia Sotomayor    said she would have rejected Indiana’s appeal in its entirety.     The court rejected without noted dissent Indiana’s effort to reinstate the ban on selective abortions. But there, too, the court stressed it wasn’t ruling on the constitutionality of the restriction, but rather choosing to move at deliberate speed.     “Only the Seventh Circuit has thus far addressed this kind of law,” the court said. “We follow our ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals.”     In his separate opinion, Justice Thomas agreed that “further percolation may assist our review.” But he spent most of his 20 pages linking family-planning advocates to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century—something the Supreme Court itself endorsed in 1927, when it upheld a Virginia law authorizing involuntary sterilization of individuals the state deemed “imbeciles.”     “From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics,” Justice Thomas wrote.     Based on pseudoscientific prejudices, the eugenics movement sought to “improve” the human race by preventing people considered inferior from reproducing. Indiana passed the first eugenic sterilization law in 1907, and more than half the states eventually followed. Eugenics became a cornerstone of Nazi ideology and was widely repudiated following World War II.     Justice Thomas’s assertions regarding the link between eugenics, birth control and abortion “are not quite in line with history,” said Adam Cohen, whose book on the 1927 case, “Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck,” Justice Thomas cited repeatedly in his opinion.     While some early 20th century family-planning advocates believed in eugenics, some eugenics supporters opposed abortion, Mr. Cohen said. More fundamentally, he said, “sterilization laws were about the government deciding, while abortion laws are about the woman deciding.” He added: “She is not thinking about the future of the race, she is thinking about whether to have a particular child.”     Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
