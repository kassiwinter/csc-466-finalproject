      	President Trump is no longer contagious, according to his doctor.
“This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” his physician, Sean Conley, wrote in a memo released by the White House Saturday night.
The memo comes 10 days after Trump first experienced symptoms of his COVID-19 diagnosis and as the president readies to return to the campaign trail.
Trump has been fever-free for “well over 24 hours” and has seen “all symptoms improv[e],” the physician wrote.
Conley, though, does not mention if the president has tested negative for the virus — only stating that there is “no longer evidence of actively replicating virus.”
