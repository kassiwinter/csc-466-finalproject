The Justice Department’s internal watchdog referred its finding that former FBI Deputy Director         Andrew McCabe    had misled investigators to federal prosecutors to determine whether he should be charged with a crime, according to people familiar with the matter. It is unclear when the referral was made or if the investigation is likely to result in any charges. Representatives for the Justice Department declined to comment.     Mr. McCabe’s lawyer, Michael Bromwich, said he was advised of the referral within the past few weeks, has met with the U.S. attorney’s office, and believes the referral is “unjustified.”          “We are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration, the US Attorney’s Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute,” Mr. Bromwich said in a statement.

Mr. McCabe was fired last month, a day before he was eligible to retire from his post with full benefits, based on the inspector general’s findings. He has said he never deliberately misled investigators and cited the “chaos” of the period when President      Donald Trump        fired Mr. Comey, and Mr. McCabe unexpectedly became acting director of the FBI.     According to the inspector general’s report, Mr. McCabe had authorized a lawyer in his office to speak to a Journal reporter and provide details about a telephone call Mr. McCabe had with a senior Justice Department official, but later told agents from the FBI’s inspections division he didn’t know who had given information about the call to the Journal. The inspector general’s report said Mr. McCabe provided a similar impression to Mr. Comey. Mr. McCabe has disputed those findings, saying he didn’t intend to mislead anyone and corrected the record when he realized his errors.     “At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted—and for that I take full responsibility,” Mr. McCabe wrote in a column for the Washington Post last month.     His dismissal drew scrutiny in part because Mr. McCabe was a frequent target of Mr. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump tweeted in March that Mr. McCabe “knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.”     Last week, Mr. Bromwich said Mr. McCabe’s legal team was “actively considering” filing civil lawsuits against Mr. Trump and “senior members of the administration” that would allege wrongful termination, defamation and constitutional violations.     The inspector general’s report also concluded that Mr. McCabe engaged in misconduct by sanctioning the disclosure to the Journal reporter, saying that violated the FBI’s media policy. Mr. McCabe has said he had full authority to make decisions about speaking to reporters.      Inspectors general serve as watchdogs for government agencies, and are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but don’t automatically change with administrations in order to maintain independence from the agencies they are tasked with investigating.      The Justice Department’s inspector general,         Michael Horowitz,    was nominated to the post in 2011 by Democratic President         Barack Obama.         Mr. Horowitz had previously spent a decade as a prosecutor in Manhattan and as an official at Justice Department headquarters in Washington. He also worked as a lawyer in private practice and served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission after being appointed by former Republican President         George W. Bush.         Mr. McCabe, after rising swiftly through the ranks at the agency, was tapped by Mr. Comey in January 2016 to serve as his deputy, putting him at the center of sensitive investigations into Mr. Trump and Democratic presidential candidate         Hillary Clinton.         Mr. McCabe’s wife,         Jill McCabe,    had run for state office in Virginia the prior year as a Democrat with the financial help of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an ally of the Clintons, leading to criticism that Mr. McCabe should have recused himself from the probes.     The FBI has said that Mr. McCabe played no role in his wife’s campaign and that Mr. McCabe received clearance from the FBI’s ethics office to oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton.
