                                                                                                                                         GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Sunday flatly denied that he’s “tapping into the anger” of voters across the country — a charge that has been made by his Republican primary rivals, political pundits of all stripes, and even President Obama.                                                                                                                                                      In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Trump said his campaign is built not on anger but on the idea that, with the proper leadership, the nation’s problems can be solved quickly.                                                                                                                                                      “People are angry. They are angry,” the billionaire real estate mogul said. “I’m not tapping into the anger, and some people have said I’m doing that, and certainly I’m not doing it intentionally. I just know it can be turned around, it can be turned around quickly. But I’ll tell you what — if you have another four years of, like, a Hillary [Clinton], that kind of mentality and thinking, we’re not going to have a country left.”                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Trump remains far ahead of his Republican primary rivals. The latest Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Mr. Trump with the support of 36.5 percent of likely Republican voters, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz coming in second, with 17.8 percent.                                                                                                                              Mr. Cruz is, however, on Mr. Trump’s heels in the crucial state of Iowa, which holds its caucuses on Feb. 1.                                                                                                                                                                 Still, Mr. Trump continues to boast about his sizable lead in national surveys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 “It’s a very strong domination and it’s a very big lead,” he said.
