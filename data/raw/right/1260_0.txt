 On his way out the door as Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta has lifted the ban on women serving in combat roles on the front lines of our wars. More from AP: 
Senior defense officials say Pentagon chief Leon Panetta is removing the military's ban on women serving in combat, opening hundreds of thousands of front-line positions and potentially elite commando jobs after more than a decade at war.
The groundbreaking move recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff overturns a 1994 rule banning women from being assigned to smaller ground combat units. Panetta's decision gives the military services until January 2016 to seek special exceptions if they believe any positions must remain closed to women. Question: Does this mean women will now be required by law to sign up for the draft at the age of 18? Equal rights, equal fights.
