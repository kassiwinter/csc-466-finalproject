The pay-go provision, which requires a point of order against any bill that raises the deficit or reduces a surplus, could create additional hurdles in accomplishing progressive legislative priorities in areas including climate change.The House on Thursday approved the rules package, with Ocasio-Cortez's "no" vote joined by two other lawmakers.
