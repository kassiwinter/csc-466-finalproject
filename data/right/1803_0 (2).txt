  	Former Hewlett-Packard head Carly Fiorina is reportedly set to announce her candidacy for the presidency as a Republican on Monday, making her the only other woman in the race besides Hillary Clinton, at least for now.
Fiorina has scheduled a “town hall” online via Periscope where she’ll take questions following her announcement.
The next day, the former tech executive speaks at TechCrunch in New York City. After that, she embarks on a tour of the early-nominating states: She stops in Iowa on Thursday, New Hampshire on Friday and South Carolina on Saturday.
Also, Fiorina’s new book will be released on Tuesday. Fiorina’s share of all proceeds from the book are going to a charitable foundation, according to a spokesperson for the candidate.
