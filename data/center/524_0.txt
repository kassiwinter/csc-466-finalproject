In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of "extortion and blackmail" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren Sánchez.A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a "long period".What have the Saudis and Bezos said?The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy issued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince."We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out," the embassy said.Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts' statement, but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggi's fiancée, along with the tag #Jamal:Phone hacking 'all too common'Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporterA hack such as this was "horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered," says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone.From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps.Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year, a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files. Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments.But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities?Timeline of Bezos-Saudi disputeJun 2017 - Jamal Khashoggi flees Saudi Arabia and goes into self-imposed exile in the USSept 2017 - Khashoggi starts writing for the Washington Post, criticising the polices of Mohammed bin SalmanApr 2018 - Mr Bezos attends a dinner with the crown prince and they exchange numbers1 May 2018 - Mr Bezos receives an encrypted MP4 video file allegedly sent from the crown prince's personal WhatsApp account.
