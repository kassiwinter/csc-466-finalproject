Do you want us to send them back or keep working?” Whitefish Energy tweeted to the mayor Wednesday.“They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to the work for the public sector,” she tweeted in response.“The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Cruz added in comments to Yahoo News.Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee have also raised questions about the scope of the deal.“The size and terms of the contract, as well as the circumstances surrounding the contract’s formation, raise questions regarding PREPA’s standard contract awarding procedures,” Reps.
