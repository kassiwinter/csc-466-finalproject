                                                                                                                                         Officials announced Thursday that first Texas nurse to contract Ebola while treating a Liberian patient is scheduled to be transferred to a leading research center in suburban Washington.                                                                                                                                                      Nina Pham, 26, will be taken to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.                                                                                                                                                      Ms. Pham, who is in good condition and reported she is “doing well,” tested positive last weekend for the deadly virus that has ravaged West Africa, killing more than 4,000.                                                                                                                                                                    She had been treating Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who traveled to Dallas from Liberia and became sick with Ebola. He died last week.                                                                                                                              A second nurse, 29-year-old Amber Vinson, tested positive this week. She traveled on a commercial airplane one day before she showed symptoms Tuesday, raising fears the virus could spread beyond the Dallas hospital.                                                                                                                                                                 Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, said NIH’s director assured him the Bethesda campus is equipped to care for Ms. Pham without risk to the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 “I’m confident that all necessary steps and precautions will be taken to treat this patient and prevent the further spread of the disease,” he said.
