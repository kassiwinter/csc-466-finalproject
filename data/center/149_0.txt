Manchin rejected that bill as too broad, although even with his support, the measure would likely fall short of the 60 votes it would need to pass the 100-seat Senate.Murkowski said she had not received much reaction from other Republicans about the statement.Republican Senator Roy Blunt, who is retiring at the end of his term in 2022, told reporters he thought some Republicans could support voting-rights legislation, although it would be important to look at the formula determining how jurisdictions qualified for additional scrutiny. He said he would be willing to participate in those talks.Four Republican-led states, including Georgia and Florida, passed measures this year that voting rights activists say disproportionately burden or discourage voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled. Similar measures are pending in several other states.The lawmakers driving those measures often cite as a justification former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread voter fraud.That claim was widely rejected by numerous courts, state election officials and officials in Trump's own administration.Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization that fights voter suppression, said of the Manchin-Murkowski letter: "Generally speaking, this is a positive step."Democrats later this year are expected to reintroduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which reinstates Section 4 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and updates the formula for which jurisdictions are covered."Getting agreement, getting more Republican support and getting something by the court that would pass muster, I think those are all very high hurdles," said John Fortier, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Makini Brice
