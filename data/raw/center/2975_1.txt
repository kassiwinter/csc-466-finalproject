Jane Pauley asked Clinton on "CBS Sunday Morning.""Yes," Clinton responded. "As an active politician, it's over."I am done with being a candidate," she added. "But I am not done with politics, because I literally believe that our country's future is at stake."Clinton's comments come days before the release her new book, "What Happened," which accounts her experience in the 2016 presidential election. The former Democratic nominee reflects on her shocking loss to President Trump in the 2016 campaign and ultimately takes responsibility for the defeat. However, she points to outside factors that she said played a role in her loss, such as alleged Russian election meddling and the federal probe into her private email server. Clinton even openly questions the actions taken by former President Obama and former Vice President Biden during and after the campaign. Despite her loss, Clinton told Pauley she takes pride in having run a traditional campaign, compared to Trump's unconventional campaign. "We have a reality show that leads to the election of a president. He ends up in the Oval Office. He says, 'Boy, it's so much harder than I thought it would be. This is really tough. I had no idea.' Well, yeah, because it's not a show. It's real. It's reality for sure," she said.
