If the president announces his nominee by the end of this week, that would leave just under 40 days to get the individual confirmed before the results of the Nov. 3 election roll in.                                                                                                                   Typically, confirmations for the high court take two to three months. However, in 1993, Justice Ginsburg was confirmed in just 42 days.
