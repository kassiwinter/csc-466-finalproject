    Another senator has come forward and called for the vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court to be delayed until after his accuser speaks with members of the Judiciary Committee.
“I think that would be best for all involved, including the nominee,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told Politico on Sunday.
He urged committee members to hear Christine Blasey Ford’s side of the story first before holding a vote, despite not being one himself.
“If she does want to be heard, she should do so promptly,” Corker said.
His comments echoed those of fellow republican lawmaker Sen. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) — who is a member of the committee and is “not comfortable voting” either.
“We need to hear from her,” Flake told Politico. “And I don’t think I’m alone in this.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also said he is willing to speak with Ford first before calling for a vote.
“[I]f Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,” Graham said in a statement. “If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled.”
