       Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he has plans to give 40,000 factory jobs to Central American migrants in Mexico.       “This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said Friday. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”             Such a deal would provide a solution to some of the tens of thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum in the U.S. but have been sent back into Mexico as they await court dates on their asylum claims.       Finding a solution to securing the U.S.-Mexico border and dealing illegal immigration remains a hot topic in the U.S. Mexico promised to curb illegal immigration into the U.S. after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country if they did not stop the surge.
