    By telling a racially mixed audience in Virginia on Tuesday that the Republican ticket's economic plans would "put y'all back in chains," Vice President Biden sparked the latest campaign controversy.                                                     Vice President Joe Biden.

The Obama campaign defended Biden and said his words were meant to counter Republican promises to "unshackle" the economy from regulations. Biden himself later said he had intended to use the word "unshackle," and that "it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America" that is "outrageous."  Courtesy of C-SPAN's online archive, here is a clip of Biden's "chains" comment.      And here is a clip of new GOP vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan talking about the need to "unshackle our economy" when he delivered the Republican response to President Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address.
