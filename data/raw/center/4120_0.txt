WASHINGTON—President Trump vetoed a congressional resolution disapproving of his national-emergency declaration, asserting his authority to tap funding for barriers on the southern border even though the money hadn’t been appropriated by lawmakers.“Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. “And I’m very proud to veto it.” He was flanked by Vice President      Mike Pence,        law-enforcement officials and parents of children who were allegedly killed by immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally.     The veto is the first of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and lawmakers face a tall order in overriding it, which would require a two-thirds majority in each chamber of Congress. Democratic leaders in the House are planning a vote this month, and the initiative still faces legal and other challenges.               The Senate on Thursday voted 59-41 to pass a resolution terminating Mr. Trump’s declaration, with 12 Republicans joining Democrats in challenging Mr. Trump on his signature policy issue. That followed an earlier House vote in which a handful of House Republicans also joined Democrats in objecting to the president’s sidestepping congressional control of the purse. Some Republicans also warned Mr. Trump’s precedent could be embraced by future Democratic presidents to bypass Congress on their priorities, such as climate change.     Mr. Trump intends to use $6.7 billion from the military and other sources, only some of which are contingent on declaring the national emergency, to build more barriers on the border with Mexico. He issued the declaration on Feb. 15 after signing legislation that funded the government through September, legislation that provided $1.38 billion for 55 miles of border barriers. That deal came on the heels of a five-week partial government shutdown.     Though an override of Mr. Trump’s veto seemed unlikely Friday, the dynamic could be altered when details become known of which military-construction projects Mr. Trump intends to draw from and lawmakers look to protect interests in their states. Lawmakers had demanded to see the list of military projects that would be stalled, but the Defense Department didn’t provide it before Thursday’s vote.     Many Republicans have been critical of the idea of siphoning funds away from military projects to build the wall, arguing Mr. Trump could tap other pots of federal funds.     The House is set to hold a vote March 26 on overriding the veto, but it isn’t expected to succeed. The House rejection of the emergency passed late last month with 245 votes, some 45 votes short of the needed two-thirds. The 59 votes it received in the Senate were short of the 67-vote threshold that would be needed there.     “The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president’s lawless power grab, yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress and the will of the American people,” House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) said Friday.      The White House wants to use the emergency declaration to divert $3.6 billion from military funding to the wall. It separately wants to tap $2.5 billion from the Defense Department’s effort to fight illegal drugs and $600 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.     Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to build a wall across the border that would be paid for by Mexico, has had a hard time fulfilling that promise, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress during his first two years. He has pressed members of his own party to back him and cast opposition to the declaration as tantamount to being opposed to national security.     Mr. Trump on Friday denounced the resolution as “reckless” and a “vote against reality,” and he portrayed a border overrun by people and illegal drugs—a characterization critics say is alarmist.     Democrats have agreed to increase funding for border security but have called an extended border wall an unnecessary use of funds.     Mr. Trump also has rebuffed plans by Republicans to defuse the issue by agreeing to language limiting future declarations. One late attempt to seal such a deal came Wednesday evening when Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and         Ben Sasse    of Nebraska made an unscheduled visit to the White House as Mr. Trump was having dinner.        
More        Mr. Graham tweeted Friday after the veto, “President Trump is right to declare an emergency on our southern border and he’s right on the law allowing him to reallocate funds to secure our southern border.”     Former President Obama vetoed 12 bills, of which one was overridden by Congress. In 2016, lawmakers overrode Mr. Obama’s veto of legislation that would let Americans sue foreign governments over terrorist attacks.     —Natalie Andrews and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.
