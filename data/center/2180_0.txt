                                          A new WSJ/NBC poll released Wednesday shows Americans are just as divided as the 2016 presidential candidates over whether the Senate should vote on an Obama Supreme Court nominee.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of registered voters found that 43% preferred the Senate to vote this year on Mr. Obama’s choice to fill the unexpected opening, while 42% said the position should remain vacant until 2017, when a new president could nominate a replacement. The remaining 15% had no opinion.      The survey found voters were split deeply along party lines, with 71% of the Democrats favoring Senate consideration of an Obama nominee and 73% of Republicans supporting no action until the next president assumes office.     Voters who identified as independent were almost evenly divided, 43% to 42%, on whether senators should take up a court pick this year.               The president is expected to announce his selection in the coming weeks, but the nominee could face long odds in a Republican-controlled Senate, which approves judicial candidates.     The stakes are high for each party, in terms of both politics and law.     The Supreme Court has held a slim conservative majority for decades. Mr. Obama could affect the direction of the law for years to come if he successfully places a lifetime appointee to succeed Justice Scalia, a leading conservative.     Because Justice Scalia’s death came in the middle of a heated election campaign, how voters react to each side’s maneuvers over the court vacancy could have a significant impact on who wins the White House, not to mention control of the Senate.          Within hours of the news that Justice Scalia had died while on a trip in western Texas, Republican presidential candidate         Ted Cruz    and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the vacancy shouldn’t be filled by Mr. Obama in his final year in office. Mr. Obama the same day said he would nominate a successor and that the Senate had a responsibility to give that person a hearing and a vote.     Senate Republicans haven’t reached a firm conclusion on whether to hold hearings to evaluate the president’s eventual nominee.     It is rare in modern times for a justice to die in office, moreover for it to happen during an election year. Most have left the court through retirements, often timed to increase the likelihood that a like-minded president could appoint a a successor.
