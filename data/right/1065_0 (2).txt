                                                                                                                                         Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, said Thursday that people are able to “window shop” for health care on the federal government website at this point, but that “the store is open and we’ve locked the front door.”                                                                                                                                                      “I think it’s probably more than a glitch,” she said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I think it’s really important that people get in the store, because if they don’t get in the store, the prices continue to go up for everyone who’s going to shop late. So how do we fix this, and how do we get around what has become the most popular political two-by-four in a decade, and that is Obamacare and the misinformation about Obamacare that continues to be so prevalent out there?”                                                                                                                                                      Ms. McCaskill said she believes that they can get it fixed, but wouldn’t say whether she would vote for a proposal from Sen. Mary Landrieu, Louisiana Democrat, that would allow individual insurance plans to be grandfathered in so people can keep what they have.                                                                                                                                                         “It may be the Landrieu bill; it may be something else,” she said. “I don’t know if it’s going to pass, and I don’t know if what we vote on will ultimately be the Landrieu bill.”
