WASHINGTON—      Nancy Pelosi        was elected House speaker as the 116th Congress convened Thursday and Democrats passed bills aimed at ending the partial government shutdown, but those measures were expected to stall in the GOP-controlled Senate. The Democrats’ takeover of the House opened a new and contentious era of divided government in Washington, giving Mrs. Pelosi and her party a platform to challenge President Trump as the early stages of the 2020 race for the White House take shape.

Mrs. Pelosi won the speakership for the second time—no one else has lost and reclaimed the gavel since 1955—with 220 votes to 192 for Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the newly installed GOP leader. Fifteen members voted for other candidates and three members voted present.     The House passed on Thursday night a series of bills that would reopen the government after 13 days. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he wouldn’t hold votes on the Democratic bills, and there are few signs of a resolution to the standoff as Democrats resist Mr. Trump’s demand for $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.          Mrs. Pelosi, the only woman ever to serve as speaker, takes the reins with an ideologically diverse Democratic caucus that won its majority in part by opposing Mr. Trump’s policies. Democratic lawmakers, who now take over the House’s oversight machinery, have said they would use their authority to review the Republican president’s tax returns and probe his business dealings.     Mrs. Pelosi has resisted calls from some members of her caucus to open impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, saying the House would wait for the results of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump and Russia have denied any wrongdoing.     On the legislative front, House Democrats plan to focus on measures to lower prescription-drug prices, ramp up spending on the nation’s infrastructure and overhaul ethics and campaign-finance rules in Washington.     Mr. Trump, whose 2016 campaign included a trillion-dollar infrastructure package, has said he was willing to work with Democrats on infrastructure legislation. The president congratulated Mrs. Pelosi in a surprise news briefing at the White House Thursday afternoon.     “It’s a very, very great achievement, and hopefully we’re going to work together, and we’re going to get lots of things done, like infrastructure and so much more,” Mr. Trump said.     Democrats are also expected to bring up legislation that expands background-check requirements for firearm purchases, said         Rep. Mike Thompson    (D., Calif.), chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, a body of Democratic lawmakers who support changing the nation’s gun laws.     Democrats also plan to intervene in a federal court ruling that found the Affordable Care Act to be unconstitutional.              Rep. Maxine Waters    (D., Calif.), the new chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has said she would make housing finance a priority. She will also have oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and could try to spur changes at the agency, which Democrats set up in 2010 and believe has been neutered by the last two years of GOP control of Congress and the White House.     “We enter this new Congress with a sense of great hope and confidence for the future, and deep humility and prayerfulness in the face of the challenges ahead,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a speech to the House, describing the Democrats’ mandate as lowering health-care and prescription-drug costs, protecting individuals with pre-existing medical conditions and “rebuilding America with green and modern infrastructure.”     Mrs. Pelosi, 78 years old, was first chosen to lead the caucus in 2002 and served as the first female speaker from 2007 to 2011. The Baltimore-born daughter of a congressman, she rose through California party politics, starting as a campaign volunteer, and was first elected to Congress in 1987. Her election Thursday makes her the first person to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn, a Texas Democrat, in 1955.     Democrats largely elided the divisions that had riven them leading up to Mrs. Pelosi’s election. Many wore blue buttons proclaiming “Madame Speaker” and started calling Mrs. Pelosi affectionately by her initials, NDP.     Clusters of newly elected lawmakers took pictures on the House floor, an infraction of the chamber’s rules, ahead of casting their first votes. Rep. Jahana Hayes (D., Conn.) fixed the hairstyle of fellow freshman lawmaker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). Lawmakers from both parties passed around children and grandchildren.                                         President Trump stuck to his demands for a border wall Wednesday, saying he’s willing to continue the government shutdown for as “long as it takes.” Democrats, making little progress on negotiations, criticized the president’s tactics.

Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), nominating Mr. McCarthy for speaker, praised him for bringing up legislation last year that would fund the border wall that has become the sticking point in the negotiations, drawing a standing ovation from House Republicans.     Democrats, meanwhile, focused on legislation they passed Thursday that is aimed at reopening the government but without the funds the White House is seeking for a border wall. It includes a package of six full-year spending bills that would fund most of the shuttered part of the government through September. Separately, they passed a short-term extension of current funding through Feb. 8 for the Department of Homeland Security.      Voting for Mrs. Pelosi as speaker, new Rep. Veronica Escobar (D., Texas) said she cast her vote for “Nancy No Wall Pelosi.”     Mr. McConnell has said the Senate, where the GOP holds a 53-47 edge, won’t consider any legislation that isn’t guaranteed a signature by the president. Mr. McConnell, who has led his party in the Senate since 2007, has two more seats than before last year’s midterm elections. He has largely put the onus of negotiating on Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats, whose votes will be needed to pass spending legislation through the chamber.     The new Congress is the most diverse in terms of race and gender, and both chambers will include more members hailing from their parties’ more ideologically extreme wings.        
More        The incoming Democratic ranks include the first two Muslim women, Reps.         Rashida Tlaib    (D., Mich.) and         Ilhan Omar    (D., Minn.). Ms. Tlaib wore a thobe, a traditional Palestinian garment, while Ms. Omar became the first lawmaker to wear a head scarf in Congress. Democrats were expected to change the chamber’s rules later Thursday to clarify that while hats aren’t permitted on the House floor, the restrictions wouldn’t apply to religious headdresses.     House Democrats now include 89 women out of 235 members. The House GOP now includes 13 women out of 199 members.     The incoming lawmakers constitute the least politically experienced House of Representatives in the chamber’s history, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. Among the freshmen of the 116th Congress, just 32% have state-level political experience and 15% have local-government experience.                                                 The 116th Congress is the most diverse in terms of race and gender.
