            September 19th, 2012   06:58 AM ET        	9 years agoCNN Political Reporter Peter Hamby  Washington (CNN) - New poll numbers out Wednesday from three key battleground states underscore the danger of that leaked fundraising video for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.
According to fresh New York Times/CBS News/Quinnipiac polling, majorities of likely voters in Wisconsin, Virginia and Colorado say that Romney's policies favor the rich.

In Wisconsin, 55% of likely voters say a Romney administration would benefit wealthy people. In Virginia, 56% say the same. In Colorado, the number is 54%.
The number of voters in those swing states who think Romney's policies would favor the middle class? Just about 10%.
Contrast that with President Barack Obama's numbers on the same question.
In all three states, a plurality say Obama's policies favor the middle class. Only a sliver of voters say the president favors the rich, while roughly a quarter say he favors the poor.

The new polls were taken before video surfaced of Romney privately telling a group of rich donors that nearly half the country is "dependent on the government" - and that's precisely the problem.
The Romney video reinforces what people already think about the candidate, and that only helps the Obama campaign push the now-familiar narrative that Romney is a rich plutocrat who is of touch with the concerns of regular people.
