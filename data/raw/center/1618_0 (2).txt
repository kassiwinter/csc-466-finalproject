WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Friday it would examine Oklahoma’s lethal-injection protocol, bringing new scrutiny to drug formulas states have adopted as pharmaceutical manufacturers have refused to provide narcotics for U.S. executions. Among other issues, the court will examine whether Oklahoma’s drug protocol—a new formula the state adopted after a bungled execution in April 2014 drew international criticism—complies with the constitutional prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.”        
Related        Friday’s order accepting the case comes barely a week after the court allowed Oklahoma to execute         Charles Warner,    one of the four condemned men who had filed the suit. “My body is on fire,” Mr. Warner said after the injection began, according to an Associated Press reporter who observed the Jan. 15 execution.     Four liberal justices dissented from the Jan. 15 decision to permit Mr. Warner’s execution. While the court will hear a case if four justices agree, it takes five to stay an execution. It is unknown which justices voted to take up Friday’s appeal, but they almost certainly include the four justices who would have stayed last week’s execution:         Ruth Bader Ginsburg,         Stephen Breyer,         Sonia Sotomayor    and         Elena Kagan.                   Attorneys for the three remaining plaintiffs said they would seek to have their executions—scheduled for Jan. 29, Feb. 19 and March 5—stayed while the Supreme Court considers their case. Arguments are expected in April.     Oklahoma Attorney General         Scott Pruitt,    said the execution protocol “has successfully been implemented in Oklahoma, as well as more than 10 similar executions in Florida. We will continue to defend the constitutionality of this protocol in order to preserve [the Department of Corrections’] ability to proceed with the sentences that were given to each inmate by a jury of their peers.”     “As we prepare to litigate this case in front of the Supreme Court, we must not forget the victims and their families, who have waited a combined 48 years for justice,” Mr. Pruitt said.     According to the state’s legal papers, inmate         Richard E. Glossip,    52, was convicted of arranging for “the beating death of his employer”;         John M. Grant,    53, “stabbed a correction worker to death”; and         Benjamin R. Cole,    49, “bent his nine month-old daughter in half, breaking her spine, killing her.”      In 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the use of a three-drug lethal-injection “cocktail” consisting of sodium thiopental to induce unconsciousness, pancuronium bromide to paralyze the muscles and potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest.      “The proper administration of the first drug ensures that the prisoner does not experience any pain associated with the paralysis and cardiac arrest caused by the second and third drugs,” Chief Justice         John Roberts    wrote for a three-justice plurality.     Since then, however, international opposition to capital punishment led the injectable-drug manufacturer       Hospira Inc.,    of Lake Forest, Ill., to discontinue production of sodium thiopental and to refuse to sell other drugs for executions.      “Hospira makes its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve, and, therefore, we have always publicly objected to the use of any of our products in capital punishment,” a company policy statement says.      As a result, states have been unable to use the lethal formula the Supreme Court approved in 2008. “States that employ capital punishment have struggled to obtain the necessary chemicals to conduct executions, largely due to political or extra-legal pressures exerted by opponents of the death penalty,” Oklahoma said in legal papers. “As a result of this war of attrition, the selection of drugs available to the states has dwindled.”     The drug shortage has spurred some states, such as Wyoming, to consider switching to prior means of execution, such as the firing squad.     In April’s bungled execution of         Clayton Lockett,    who awoke after he was supposed to have been knocked out and took about 45 minutes to die, Oklahoma used a formula of 100 milligrams of the sedative midazolam, followed by vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. For Mr. Warner’s execution, the state quintupled the midazolam dose.     “Today, states are not using that three-drug protocol and instead are using experimental drug combinations. The drug protocol used in Oklahoma is not capable of producing a humane execution, even if it is administered properly,” said         Dale Baich,    an attorney representing the condemned men.
