COLOMBO, Sri Lanka—A series of blasts tore through churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter morning, killing at least 290 people and wounding more than 400 in coordinated attacks on tourists and the country’s minority Christian community.At least eight explosions, most blamed on suicide bombers, took place across the country. Restaurants and houses of worship that moments earlier were hosting holiday feasts and joyful services were plunged into chaos, filled with rubble, broken furniture, shards of glass and the wounded and dead. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings. Authorities said the government had received warnings about a South Asia-based Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath, possibly targeting religious sites or political figures. But officials said the warnings weren’t specific enough to effectively act upon and didn’t include hotels or tourist sites as potential targets.     At least 37 international tourists were killed, according to police, including U.S., Chinese, Danish, Pakistani and Belgian visitors. The U.S. State Department said several Americans died.               Eight people were arrested in connection with the bombings, said authorities, who didn’t provide details about those in custody.

Facebook,    WhatsApp, Viber and other social media services were blocked as officials expressed concern about the spread of misinformation and rumors.     Sri Lanka, an island nation of 21 million people dominated by a Sinhalese-speaking Buddhist majority, was torn for decades by a brutal civil war between the government and a Tamil-speaking militant group, known as the Tamil Tigers, which was among the first to employ suicide bombings. The country also has a number of religious minorities, including Muslims, who make up about 10% of the population, and Christians, about 7%.

The civil war ended in 2009 when the government crushed the Tamil insurgency. But tensions rose last year when a Sinhalese Buddhist leader who was president when the war ended made a bid to return to power as prime minister. His bid was ruled unconstitutional and he ultimately backed down, but the country has remained on edge ahead of a presidential election later this year.     After Sunday’s attacks, scenes of destruction and suffering were broadcast by local news stations from churches, one in the capital, Colombo, one just north of the capital and a third in Batticaloa, in the east of the country.                   Father Edmond Tillekeratne,    director of the Catholic archdiocese social communications center at St. Sebastian’s Church in the city of Negombo, north of the capital, said bodies of worshipers were still scattered around the church. At least 600 people had been inside for Easter service, he estimated, when the explosions occurred.     “The whole roof was shattered and there was flesh all over the walls and even outside the church,” he said, adding that the explosion seemed to come from the crowd.     In a video posted on social media, rescue workers could be seen speaking with parishioners at St. Sebastian’s amid the carnage. The ceiling above was blown apart and the morning sky could be seen through most of it. Other videos showed bloodied bodies draped across pews and piled atop each other in between them.     Damage was also reported at three hotels in Colombo popular with foreign tourists, the Shangri-La, the Kingsbury and the Cinnamon Grand. Sri Lanka has a vibrant tourism industry, with some 2 million visitors arriving annually from around the world in recent years.     Another blast occurred in a tourist district near the city zoo in Colombo, and another near a housing complex on the capital’s outskirts.     “We heard a deafening noise and a shock wave knocked us onto the ground. Initially I didn’t know what to do,” said         Sujeewa Perera,    who was passing by the Cinnamon Grand with a friend near Colombo’s seafront when the blast went off at one of the hotel’s restaurants. “There were people screaming and running everywhere. Someone helped me into a passing vehicle that dropped me off at the hospital. I still don’t know what happened to my friend.”     Hours after the blasts, people were still working to clear bodies from the attack sites. Helped by priests, they combed through torn clothing, fragments of wood from destroyed pews and building debris in search of survivors, and then to remove the dead.

No one was hurt.     The attacks began about 9 a.m. local time, with six of the blasts taking place almost simultaneously. Analysts said that targeting so many locations simultaneously with such deadly results indicated sophisticated planning.     “That eight separate suicide bombings took place within a matter of hours suggests the presence of a sophisticated terrorist infrastructure in the country,” said         Kamran Bokhari,    director of the Center for Global Policy, an independent think tank in Washington.     The attacks brought widespread international condemnation.          President         Trump    offered condolences in a tweet Sunday morning and European Commission President         Jean-Claude Juncker    said it was with horror and sadness that he heard of the attacks. Pope Francis said, “I entrust to the Lord those who have tragically died and pray for the wounded and all those who suffer as a result of this dramatic event.”     Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo    also denounced the killings. “Attacks on innocent people gathering in a place of worship or enjoying a holiday meal are affronts to the universal values and freedoms that we hold dear, and demonstrate yet again the brutal nature of radical terrorists whose sole aim is to threaten peace and security,” he said.     “We can confirm that several U.S. citizens were among those killed,” Mr. Pompeo said. “The U.S. Embassy is working tirelessly to provide all possible assistance to the American citizens affected by the attacks and their families.”
