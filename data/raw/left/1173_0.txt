The U.S. Postal Service is well prepared and has ample capacity to deliver America’s election mail for the upcoming general election in November.On any given day, the Postal Service delivers more than 425 million pieces of mail, and our best estimates are that election mail will account for less than 2% of all mail volume from mid-September until Election Day. Given our available processing capacity, we can easily handle the anticipated increase in election mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic, without impact to on-time performance.In recent weeks, the Postal Service has taken steps to improve our efficiency — including ensuring that our trucks meet operational deadlines and requiring that overtime be earned as the result of unexpected volume or other factors, pursuant to our normal overtime analysis — which is vital given our financial situation. Contrary to media accounts and other accusations, there have been no edicts to delay the mail or eliminate overtime. Rather, we are ensuring that our operations run on time and on schedule, which will avoid unnecessary overtime and transportation costs. We are making these changes methodically and in ways designed to ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of America’s mail — including election mail.The Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process by doing everything we can to handle and deliver election mail, including ballots, in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.The only concerns we have about the upcoming election is that many states have designed their election systems without considering the ordinary time frames required by the Postal Service to process and deliver mail. For that reason, throughout this year, we have worked closely with election officials regarding our mailing requirements, delivery standards and best practices for enabling voting by mail.In particular, we are asking election officials and voters to realistically consider how the mail works — and to be mindful of our delivery standards — in order to provide voters ample time to cast their votes through the mail.And we look forward to continued coordination with election officials through November.David Williams is chief logistics and processing operations officer and executive vice president of the U.S. Postal Service, where Thomas Marshall is general counsel and executive vice president.If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page
