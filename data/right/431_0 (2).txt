Manger said Roseberry had recently experienced "losses of family" and said investigators were in contact with his loved ones.      next      A person is apprehended after being in a pickup truck parked on the sidewalk in front of the Library of Congress' Thomas Jefferson Building, as seen from a window of the U.S. Capitol, Thursday, Aug. 19, 2021, in Washington.

Police responded to a call for a disturbance, he said. "The driver of the truck told the responding officer on the scene that he had a bomb. And what appeared, the officer said, appeared to be a detonator in the man's hand," Manger said. "We immediately evacuated the nearby buildings."Manger said law enforcement was in communication with the suspect but did not yet know his motive. He did not answer a question regarding a live stream posted by an alleged suspect.Police negotiators were communicating with him as he wrote notes and showed them to authorities from inside the truck, the Capitol Police said. Officers gave him a phone in an effort to continue communication with him. "My negotiators are hard at work trying to have a peaceful resolution to this incident," Manger said. "We're trying to get as much information as we can to find a way to peacefully resolve this."The USCP announced the suspicious activity on its Twitter page just after 9:40 a.m. local time and urged people to stay away from the area.Associated Press reporter Mike Balsamo tweeted that investigators "are trying to determine whether the suspicious device in the pickup truck is an operable explosive and whether the man in the truck was holding a detonator."Aaron Fritschner, communications director for Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., shared on Twitter screenshots of message alerts he had received from the police agency. One message sent at 9:53 a.m. states, "Madison: Internal Security Threat: move inside office/lock doors, seek cover, and remain silent."A subsequent message said: "Jefferson: EVACUATE. Proceed to your designated assembly area. DO NOT exit out of the west side (First Street) of the building."Other areas in the region were also ordered to evacuate to neighboring buildings, Fox News has learned, but the entire Capitol was not locked down. The city's Metropolitan Police Department was canvassing certain nearby neighborhoods asking residents to evacuate, the department said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPolice have said the investigation is ongoing.
