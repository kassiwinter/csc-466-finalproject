Hillary Clinton swept to four primary victories over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in a showing that makes her the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.Mrs. Clinton’s chief task now shifts from winning more states to unifying a fractured party and persuading supporters of Mr. Sanders to coalesce behind her. Her first step appeared to be turning down the rhetorical temperature, giving Mr. Sanders’s supporters space to move in her direction. Mrs. Clinton took Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut, the three largest prizes of the evening, as well as Delaware, while Mr. Sanders pulled off a win in Rhode Island.                                         Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Bernie Sanders came up short in their primaries Tuesday, but both are arguing they would perform better in November's general election than the current front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

But so far, the Sanders campaign is showing little sign it is ready to step aside and make it easier for her to capture the nomination. The race has exposed deep fissures between Sanders and Clinton backers rooted in age, race and ideology, as Mr. Sanders built a passionate following among young, white, liberal voters.               A new poll shows Mr. Sanders is the most popular person in the race in either party among young voters. The Harvard Institute of Politics survey showed that among 18-to-29-year-olds, 54% viewed him positively, 31% negatively. Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, was the favorite of African-Americans, centrists and older Democrats. In the Harvard poll, only 37% of young voters viewed Mrs. Clinton in a positive light.

Any effort to push out Mr. Sanders, he said, “will trigger the opposite.”     One question facing Clinton allies is when they can become more direct in calling for Mr. Sanders to focus on party unity and concede he can’t win the nomination.     Speaking to cheering supporters in Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton stressed the goal of bringing the party together. “We will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together,” she said.     Mrs. Clinton offered her most direct outreach to date to Mr. Sanders’s backers, saying she shares his priorities like fighting inequality. “Whether you support Sen. Sanders or support me, there’s much more that unites us than divides us,” Mrs. Clinton said.     Mr. Sanders said late Tuesday he was staying in the race, but suggested that he recognized his biggest impact might be in pushing the party’s message to the left. “This campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform,” he said in a statement.                                          Tuesday's primaries in five northeastern states further propelled front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton toward their parties' nominations. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib discusses the key takeaways.

Bernie Sanders, facing some tough races in Tuesday's primaries, told supporters that he's still a better bet than Hillary Clinton to beat Donald Trump, despite long odds in the Democratic delegate count.                                                                                                     Polling suggests the party is becoming less unified, not more. In March, 78% of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied if Mrs. Clinton were the nominee. In April, that fell to 73%, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Asked if they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for president, just 58% of Sanders primary voters said yes, with 40% saying no, according to the April poll.     This has led to some uneasiness among party leaders, who fear that scars from the hard-fought campaign could make it hard to unify the party for the general election. As the race reaches the endgame, bitterness is evident from some rank-and-file Sanders voters.     At a polling place in Providence, R.I., Christine Kolasa, a retired mortgage-banking manager in her 60s, said she had voted for Mr. Sanders and would never vote for Mrs. Clinton in a general election.     “There isn’t enough money in the world to make me vote for Hillary,” said Ms. Kolasa. “She says whatever it takes to get elected.”     Cesar Barreto, 51, a Sanders supporter who voted at a Rockville, Md., polling place, said the Vermont senator should “fight to the very bitter end.” But he said that if it came to a Trump-Clinton match-up, “given the two evils, I’d probably vote for Hillary.”     The candidates came into Tuesday’s contest with Mrs. Clinton leading in pledged delegates 1,428 to 1,153. With superdelegates—party leaders who can support any candidate they choose—added to the mix, her lead stood at a more formidable 1,946 to 1,192.     A total of 2,383 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination. The five states that voted Tuesday have 384 delegates.     Mrs. Clinton entered the evening with an advantage of 275 pledged delegates. Preliminary results from the Associated Press showed she would push that lead to more than 350.

The best way for her to mobilize his supporters, Mr. Sanders said, was for her to adopt pillars of his liberal agenda, including a single-payer health-care system, a carbon tax and free tuition at public colleges. Mrs. Clinton has supported none of these ideas.     Were she to pivot now and embrace Mr. Sanders’s positions, some of her supporters point out, she would be vulnerable to charges of flip-flopping. Such a switch would also make it tougher to win over moderates and independents in a general-election showdown with Republicans.     For her part, Mrs. Clinton bristled at the suggestion that to win over Mr. Sanders and his backers, she needs to adopt his agenda. Recalling her fight with then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, she said, “We got to the end in June, and I did not put down conditions. I didn’t say, ‘You know what, if Sen. Obama does X, Y and Z, maybe I’ll support him.’ ”     She added, “I concluded after it was over in June that Sen. Obama was going to be the nominee and I didn’t want to hurt him.”          Bickering between the Sanders and Clinton camps unfolded throughout the day on Tuesday.     In a CNN interview, Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane Sanders, raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton’s refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms, while parrying calls for Mr. Sanders to release more of his tax returns.     Mrs. Clinton has released tax returns dating back to the 1970s, and during a debate on April 14, Mr. Sanders said he would release past years’ returns, citing the campaign’s busy schedule as the cause for any delays. But the day after that debate, Mr. Sanders released his full 2014 return, and he hasn’t released any since.     Mrs. Sanders on Tuesday placed a new condition on the release of tax records covering earlier years. “What’s interesting is we released the 2014, Secretary Clinton hasn’t released the transcript yet,” Mrs. Sanders said. “Why don’t we wait to see what happens?” Asked by CNN if she was linking the release of tax records to Mrs. Clinton’s release of speech transcripts, Mrs. Sanders said, “Yep.”     At the same time, a fundraising solicitation from the Sanders campaign used harsh language in describing Clinton campaign tactics.      The letter says the Clinton campaign is trying to get Mr. Sanders to tone down his rhetoric and accusing him of aiding Republican front-runner Donald Trump.     The email, from Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, said the Clinton campaign, in describing Sanders campaign methods, has “used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are ‘giving aid and comfort’ to Trump.”          While Mr. Sanders’s path to winning the nomination is growing increasingly narrow by his own admission, staying in the race and continuing to attract money and support could strengthen his hand as he tries to push the Democratic message in a more progressive direction.     Democratic operatives said that whatever the current tensions, the party will unify in the face of a Republican opponent, especially one as polarizing as either of the two leading GOP candidates, Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.     The Democrats’ divisions, they added, are nothing compared with the splits in the GOP, with the top candidates calling each other names and threats of a chaotic Republican convention in Cleveland.      Should Mrs. Clinton win the nomination, Mr. Sanders will support her over the Republican nominee, his advisers say. The question is how ardent will he be in backing her.     Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, a loyal Clinton supporter, recalled getting a phone call from her at the end of the 2008 race telling him she was dropping out and asking him to endorse Mr. Obama. That was a message Mr. Nutter said he heeded.     “I asked her, ‘What do you want me to do?’ ” Mr. Nutter said. “She said, ‘I want you to give him the same support you gave me.’ And from that moment on, I was all Sen. Obama all the time.”          —Richard Rubin, Jennifer Levitz and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
