                 | March 03, 2021 11:52 AM                The Senate on Wednesday is slated to advance a $1.9 trillion spending package after working out a deal with centrist Democrats on stimulus checks and enhanced jobless pay.      Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, had pushed for a reduction in the size and duration of enhanced unemployment. Instead, Democrats and President Biden have agreed to a quicker income phaseout of the next round of $1,400 stimulus checks, which will be capped at individuals earning $80,000 annually. The $400 in weekly bonus jobless pay remains in the bill and would expire at the end of August.            The deal was crafted to help pave the way for Democrats to pass the coronavirus spending bill this week without any help from GOP lawmakers, who say that the bill is too big and full of wasteful provisions unrelated to the pandemic.      Centrists appeared to be pleased with the changes, which would reduce the income cutoff for individuals from $100,000 to $80,000. For couples, the income cutoff for receiving checks would shrink from $200,000 to $160,000.       “I think it’s an appropriate way of bringing this to a successful conclusion,” Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, told Bloomberg.      Not all Senate Democrats were unaware of the changes or necessarily pleased with them.       Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, stressed the urgency of passing the COVID-19 spending bill into law.       “I think people desperately need resources, and we need to get these checks out the door," Cantwell told Bloomberg, adding that the original higher-income cutoff, in her opinion, “is good to go.”      Manchin has been working to shrink weekly jobless bonus pay from $400 to $300 with a June cutoff. He said the government checks could prevent people from returning to work just as the economy is attempting to reopen. He has not yet indicated whether the changes to the stimulus checks are enough to earn his support.      At a briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is "satisfied with where negotiations are" on the spending package.
