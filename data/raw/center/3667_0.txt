Even if it means sacrificing everything."Media caption, Why America's sports stars began to take a kneeKaepernick is one of a number of sports stars, including fellow NFL players Odell Beckham Jr and Shaquem Griffin, to appear in the 30th anniversary "Just Do It" campaign.On Monday the star posted the advert and the slogan on his Twitter account.Gino Fisanotti, Nike's vice president of branding for North America, was quoted by cable sports network ESPN as saying: "We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward." One of the other stars of the Nike campaign, tennis great Serena Williams, expressed her support.Some on social media though have been using the #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt hashtags, a play on the company's slogan. Country star John Rich posted a photo of a pair of socks with the Nike emblem cut off. Kaepernick, 30, remained on a contract with Nike throughout the kneeling row, but it has now been renegotiated to make him part of the anniversary campaign.The league said players not willing to stand for The Star-Spangled Banner could stay in the changing rooms until it had been performed.However the new policy is yet to be imposed as negotiations between the league and the players' union are ongoing.
