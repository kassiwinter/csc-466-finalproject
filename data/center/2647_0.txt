WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump took steps Tuesday to revive two controversial oil pipeline projects that had been rejected by the Obama administration, moves that likely represent the leading edge of a sweeping overhaul of his predecessor’s environmental agenda.Mr. Trump accompanied his actions on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access projects with broader directives that aim to ease regulations on infrastructure projects and American manufacturing, and he ordered his team to craft a plan to maximize the use of American-made materials in U.S. pipelines. The actions were part of a flurry of activity in Mr. Trump’s first few days intended to set a pro-business tone that would contrast with former President         Barack Obama    and possibly with Congress.     Environmentalists have urged rejection of the pipelines as part of a commitment to fighting climate change, while fossil-fuel companies argue the projects are essential for energy security and the economy.               The energy industry welcomed Tuesday’s actions. Shares of the companies behind the projects jumped and the prospect of ramped-up infrastructure projects helped drive up shares of miners and manufacturers, sending some major stock indexes to record levels.

Environmental groups blasted the president’s moves, and activists arranged rallies in major cities across the U.S. to protest the action.     “It’s a dark day for reason, but we will continue the fight,” said Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org and one of the leaders in the Keystone fight. “This is not a done deal. People will mobilize again.”     Some of Mr. Trump’s directives and announcements, while presented in forceful language, lacked specifics, and their ultimate impact remains uncertain.     Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is taking on some of the most powerful symbols within the current political debate. He also issued an order Friday aimed at lifting some requirements of the Affordable Care Act and said Monday the U.S. would withdraw from a 12-nation trade deal.     Of Mr. Trump’s five executive actions Tuesday, two were the presidential memorandums aimed at reviving and expediting approval for Keystone XL and Dakota Access. The projects were designed to help expand infrastructure in response to a North American oil boom, but they both ran into fierce opposition and ultimately were denied permits under Mr. Obama.     If completed, Keystone would send up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Canada’s oil sands to Steele City, Neb., where it would link to existing pipelines to Gulf Coast refineries. The Dakota Access project would carry up to 570,000 barrels of oil a day from North Dakota to Illinois.              Harold Hamm,    chief executive of         Continental    Resources Inc., an oil producer in North Dakota, lauded Mr. Trump for making good on campaign promises he made. “America needs infrastructure built,” he said. “For free markets and everything, I think this sends a critical message.”     While Continental has no oil committed to Dakota Access, Mr. Hamm, an adviser to Mr. Trump during the campaign, said the pipeline will help other producers get their crude to market.      Any concrete action stemming from the memos issued Tuesday pertaining to the pipelines is likely to face legal challenges and may need the backing of others. For example, Nebraska must approve Keystone’s proposed route through that state.

In one of his memos Tuesday, Mr. Trump directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to “review and approve in an expedited manner” requests for approvals on the Dakota pipeline.     On Keystone, Mr. Trump invited its builder, TransCanada Corp., to reapply for a permit and directed the State Department to make a final decision within 60 days of receiving that application. As he signed the document, Mr. Trump said, “We’re going to renegotiate some of the terms, and if they’d like, we’ll see if we can get that pipeline built.”     The other memos put responsibility on the Commerce Department.     One required the department to issue a plan within six months for how pipeline companies should use steel made in the U.S., while another gave the department leadership on expediting federal reviews of infrastructure projects.      The final document also directs the commerce secretary to produce a report on streamlining federal permitting for domestic manufacturers.     “The regulatory process in this country has become a tangled mess,” Mr. Trump said.     Mr. Obama in November 2015 denied a State Department permit Keystone needed to cross the border from Canada into the U.S. after a review that took more than seven years.      In December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit needed to complete the last leg of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, citing concerns by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that it could pollute its water supplies and disrupt its sacred lands.     Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, said Mr. Trump’s action disregards Native American treaty rights and the tribe will take legal action to fight it.     The pipelines themselves are unlikely to do much to broadly affect climate change, improve the U.S. economy or enhance energy security, experts say. Persistently low oil prices raise questions about the economic viability of Keystone in particular.     A spokesman for TransCanada said the firm intends to reapply for a State Department permit.       Energy Transfer Partners    LP, the company behind Dakota Access, didn’t respond to requests for comment.     Shares of TransCanada closed Tuesday up 3.54% to $48.84, while Energy Transfer was up 3.5% to $35.75.     —Paul Vieira, Will Connors, Christopher M.
