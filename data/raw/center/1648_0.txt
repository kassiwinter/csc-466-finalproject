For the last two-plus years, I have been fortunate to interview industry dignitaries, thinkers, entrepreneurs, and leaders for Forbes Insights in the podcast Futures in Focus about the forthcoming world of 2030. 95% of the interviews have been incredibly optimistic, with a cause. 2020 has been an acid test of their ideas, visions, and practices. 2020 could be seen as a catalyst for ideas like EV dominance by 2030. Just look at the market capitalization of Tesla. 2020 has violently accelerated the shift to digital retail.

There have also been calamities. The travel industry (inside and outside of the US) was in the middle of a ten year high in 2019. Can you even remember the blockbuster movies of 2020? Yet early signs from WW 84 and home watching have breathed life back into the idea of blockbusters going straight to pay per view. Remember how boxing has survived on pay per view before. The lesson here is that the future is not as predictable as we may like to think as necessity is the mother of invention for whole industries.  Here are the twenty-one predictions for 2021 headlines for the next three articles, where you will see more specific details and logic for each one.

The urban retreat might not be permanent, but cities will change forever if we don’t do something about it in 2021.

Will college ever be the same as before, or are we at a moment of reckoning for higher education in the US? We are about to find out if 2020 continues through 2021. Indeed change will have to come. The future restaurants may be in the cloud or on trucks for a long time to come. 2021 will be the phoenix year for this. Millennials may be the most financially and career-wise stunted segment from 2020. Recovery may look very different for them as they were meant to come into their own. Digital transformation flips to intelligent systems, very fast. Faster and more prosperous than even the digital transformation of the last ten years.

The focus on sustaining and evolving work culture goes into hyperdrive in 2021 as historical goodwill runs out. In 2021 Digital economy companies will take share from distant markets as their cloud infrastructure enables almost infinite agility for those who get it. 2021 will be a year choices’ have to be made by leaders. 2020 was a year choice’ were thrust upon us. We need to develop new digital frameworks at our core for 2021 for our people, customers, and strategic futures. In 2021 more of us will be tracked in everything we do than ever before.
