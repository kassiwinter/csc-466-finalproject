NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!  An examination of the exit polls sheds light on how a president facing unemployment near 8 percent, debt topping $16 trillion and mounting questions over the Libya terror attack was able to win a second term in office.Obama’s win Tuesday night came from a strong showing among core Democratic constituencies, being more likeable than his opponent, and an economy that voters felt is doing well-enough to give him another four years. Also, the president’s response to Hurricane Sandy in the final days of the campaign was an important factor to many voters.Obama’s key groups made the difference -- both in their makeup of the electorate and, for the most part, their strength of support for him.Non-whites made up 28 percent of the electorate, up a bit from 27 percent in 2008. This group largely backed Obama: 71 percent of Hispanics (it was 67 percent last time), and 93 percent of blacks (down a touch from 95 percent).Republican challenger Mitt Romney won among white voters by 20 percentage points. That’s up from John McCain’s edge of +12 points in 2008. In addition, the share of votes cast by whites was lower (72 percent) than it has been going back to at least 1992.More On This... Click to read the exit polls.Young voters were important to giving Obama his first term. Voters under age 30 showed up again this time: They represented 19 percent of all voters, one point higher than the 18 percent in 2008. Even so, they didn’t back him as strongly this time: 60 percent -- down six points.NationalYoung VotersObama      60%Romney     37%Seniors backed Romney by 56-44 percent, mostly unchanged from 2008.Meanwhile, more Democrats than Republicans voted, 38-32 percent. In 2008, Democrats also outnumbered Republicans by 39-32 percent.Almost all Democrats supported the president (92 percent). That support was equaled among Republicans for Romney (93 percent).Forty-five percent of independents backed Obama, down from 52 percent last time. Half of this swing group preferred Romney (49 percent).Marital status was a more significant factor than gender this year. Women, a traditional Democratic voting group, backed Obama by 11 points -- about the same as by 13 points in 2008. Even so, married women backed Romney by 7 points (an improvement from McCain’s +3 showing).Men backed Romney (52-45 percent), and married men backed him by an even wider margin (60-38 percent).Romney was successful in energizing his base: conservatives accounted for 35 percent of all voters today, one-point higher than in 2008. And he captured 82 percent of them (McCain got 78 percent). White born-again Christians made up 26 percent of the voters today and 78 percent favored Romney (for McCain it was 74 percent).In addition, white Catholics went for Romney by a margin of 59-40 percent. This is a group that has historically backed the winner.About four voters in 10 say Obama’s response to Hurricane Sandy was important to their vote (42 percent), and they backed the president by a better than two-to-one margin. Fifteen percent said it was the “most important” factor in their vote.Mood of the CountryObama’s victory comes despite voter dissatisfaction with how things are going in the country, mediocre economic ratings and a majority opposing his health care plan.Less than half of voters think the country is headed in the right direction (46 percent). Fifty-two percent say things are going in the wrong direction. Still, that’s an improvement from the 75 percent who thought so in 2008.NationalDirection of the CountryRight Direction      46%Wrong Track       52%For reference, when former President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004, it was 49 percent right direction and 46 percent wrong track.Voters who said the country is on the right track went for Obama (93-6 percent), while those who said things are going in the wrong direction went solidly for Romney (84-13 percent).Overall, 23 percent rate the condition of the nation’s economy positively (2 percent “excellent” and 21 percent “good”). That’s three times as many as the 7 percent who rated it positively in 2008.Fully 77 percent of voters gave a gloomier assessment (45 percent “not so good” and 31 percent “poor”).Almost all Republicans (96 percent) and most independents (80 percent) gave the economy a thumbs-down, as did 58 percent of Democrats.Voters are also divided over whether the economy is getting better or worse (39-30 percent).Obama benefited from more voters blaming Bush (53 percent) than him (38 percent) for current economic conditions.NationalBlame For CurrentEconomic ProblemsObama      38%Bush        53%Twenty-five percent said they are better off today than four years ago -- almost identical to the 24 percent who felt that way in 2008. More -- 33 percent -- said they are worse off now. Another 41 percent say there has been no change in their family’s financial situation.Most of those saying they are better off today voted to re-elect the president (84-15 percent). Those who are worse off sided with Romney by 80-18 percent.Results on the role of government favored Romney. Fifty-one percent said they prefer smaller government with fewer services, while 43 percent prefer larger government.These divided views translate into clear vote preferences: voters who want the government to do less backed Romney by a whopping 50-point margin, and those that want it to do more went for Obama by 65 points.A 54-percent majority approves of President Obama’s job performance, while 45 percent disapprove. Almost all of those who approve voted for him today (89 percent), just as those that disapprove backed his challenger (94 percent).In addition, 19 percent of voters felt “angry” about the Obama administration and 30 percent were “dissatisfied but not angry.”  At the other end of the spectrum 24 percent felt “satisfied, but not enthusiastic,” and 25 percent felt “enthusiastic.”On the IssuesThere’s no doubt the economy is the top issue for voters -- here’s what they say is the biggest economic problem they’re personally facing. Voters saying unemployment is the biggest problem sided with Romney. Those who say rising prices go to Obama.NationalMost Important Economic IssueUnemployment      38%Rising Prices       37%Taxes             14%Housing Market      8%Romney had a one-point edge on doing a better job on the economy and likewise on the federal budget deficit (+2).More voters trust Obama than Romney to handle an international crisis (+7 points) and think he would better handle Medicare (+8 points).Nearly half of voters -- 49 percent -- think all or part of Obama’s health care law should be repealed -- something Romney had said he would do. Forty-four percent want to keep or expand the law.A plurality agrees with Obama on what should happen with income tax rates: 47 percent think taxes should increase only on income over $250,000. Some 13 percent say taxes should increase on everyone, while 35 percent don’t think anybody’s taxes should increase.The CandidatesMore voters like Obama: 53 percent have a favorable opinion of him, while 47 percent have a positive view of Romney.NationalOpinion of ObamaFavorable    53%Unfavorable  46NationalOpinion of RomneyFavorable    47%Unfavorable  50%And by 53-43 percent voters think Obama is “in touch” with people like them.NationalIn Touch With People Like YouObama is     53%Romney is    43%People looking for empathy in a candidate mostly back Obama (81-18 percent). Those looking for a candidate who shares their values went for Romney (55-42 percent), as did those who wanted someone with a vision for the future (54-45 percent).Finally, Obama successfully painted Romney as someone whose policies would favor the rich -- 53 percent of voters thought that. Almost all voters think Obama’s policies favor the middle class (44 percent) or poor (31 percent).COLORADOPresident Obama won Colorado, a battleground state that he also won in 2008, with the help of Hispanics and independents.Colorado has a large Hispanic population -- the state ranks sixth in the United States. Hispanics gave the president more support than in 2008 when he received 61 percent to McCain’s 38 percent.ColoradoHispanicsObama      74%Romney     25%White evangelicals also put their support behind the Republican candidate.

Tonight, Obama carried the state for the second time.Ohio voters are more likely to blame the country’s current economic conditions on former President George W. Bush than Obama.
