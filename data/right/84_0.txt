           President Donald Trump will visit the cities where this weekend's mass shootings took place, according to news reports.
El Paso, Texas Mayor Dee Margo said at a news conference Monday the president will visit the city Wednesday, and Federal Aviation Administration adviseries suggest Trump will be in Dayton on the same day.
Margo, a Republican, has been a critic of Trump and earlier this year would not meet with him while he was in El Paso.
But he said Monday he would meet with him under his capacity as mayor and ask Trump for federal help.
"He is president of the United States, so in that capacity, I will fulfill my obligations as mayor of El Paso and hope that if we are expressing specifics that we can get him to come through for us," Margo said.
The mayor also said he will continue to defend the city against attacks against its character, presumably by Trump.
"I don't know how we deal with evil," Margo said. "I don't have a textbook for dealing with it other than the Bible. I'm sorry. We are going to go through this. The president is coming out. I will meet with the president. I guess for people who have lots of time on their hands, I will deal with the emails and phone calls."           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
