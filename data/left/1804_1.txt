WASHINGTON -- Ian Reisner, a gay businessman who hosted an event for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in New York this week, apologized on Sunday after furious backlash from the gay community.Reisner and his longtime partner Mati Weiderpass hosted a "fireside chat" with the presidential candidate, who reportedly softened his notoriously anti-gay tone at the event by claiming that, if one of his daughters were gay, "I would love them just as much.‚Äù News of Cruz's appearance prompted a boycott of the two men's businesses.In a statement posted to his Facebook page on Sunday, Reisner sought forgiveness for his "poor judgement," explaining that he did not do his homework on Cruz's record on marriage equality before agreeing to host the event."I am shaken to my bones by the e-mails, texts, postings and phone calls of the past few days. I made a terrible mistake. I was ignorant, naive and much too quick in accepting a request to co-host a dinner with Cruz at my home without taking the time to completely understand all of his positions on gay rights," he said. "I've spent the past 24 hours reviewing videos of Cruz' statements on gay marriage and I am shocked and angry. I sincerely apologize for hurting the gay community and so many of our friends, family, allies, customers and employees. I will try my best to make up for my poor judgement. Again, I am deeply sorry," he added.Weiderpass posted a photo of Cruz in his home Wednesday night on his Facebook page.Supreme Court Proposition 8 Case
