Europe’s migrant crisis took a deadly turn far from the continent’s coasts Thursday with the discovery in Austria of a truck containing up to 50 decomposing corpses.The bodies were found in an abandoned delivery truck parked off a highway outside of Vienna, on one of the main migration routes from eastern to western Europe, Austrian police said Thursday. While more than 2,300 people died this year trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration, the gruesome discovery in inland Europe cast a sharp light on the European Union’s struggle to deal with increasing numbers of refugees crossing its borders.      The quickening flow and its consequences have sparked a debate about whether and how the influx of migrants into border states should be shared among all EU countries.               Many migrants are now traveling from Turkey to Greece and then across the Balkans to Hungary, a course considered less risky than the often deadly sea route. Around 3,000 people a day are currently being moved through the Balkans, the United Nations’ refugee agency estimates. The route has been used by roughly 10 times as many migrants so far this year as over the same period last year, according to the EU border agency Frontex.      The truck with Hungarian license plates was found near the Austrian village of Parndorf, the site of a popular outlet shopping mall about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Hungarian border. It had been left by the side of the highway for more than 24 hours, Austrian police said. Late Thursday they said they couldn’t yet determine the migrants’ cause of death, adding that preliminary inspection suggested the people suffocated or died of thirst.     Austria’s police said they were in contact with their counterparts in Hungary regarding ownership of the truck, which appeared to be a refrigerator vehicle previously used to transport chickens.

Mr. Faymann emphasized the need for European countries to cooperate, secure the union’s borders, and “fairly share” the refugee burden.     German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also attending the conference, said she was “shocked by the appalling news,” adding that it showed the need for European countries to tackle migration “quickly, and with European spirit.”     “Austria and Germany and many other member states are ready,” she said.     Austrian police late Thursday moved the truck to a former veterinary facility to cool and began removing the corpses, which they said numbered between 30 and 50. The bodies were to be transported to a forensic medical examiner’s facility in Vienna on Friday, the police said.     It wasn’t yet known where the dead migrants were from. Police said that toll records showed the truck left the Budapest area and entered Austria on Wednesday morning.     Hungary expects soon to complete a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia. That prospect has prompted many migrants to rush to enter the country, which is part of Europe’s 26-country zone of borderless travel known as the Schengen Area. Once inside, refugees can move freely in the EU, often passing through Austria.      Under EU regulations, a refugee has to request asylum in the member country he or she enters first. This policy has put pressure on countries with long external EU borders, including Hungary, Italy and Greece.     The German government said Tuesday it would allow refugees from Syria to stay in the country, no matter where they entered the EU. An interior ministry spokesman said the decision was taken for humanitarian reasons and in light of the administrative burden of returning migrants to their country of entry.     Germany registered 44,417 asylum applications from Syrians in the first seven months of this year and sent only 131 Syrians back to their first port of arrival.     Hungary this year has registered 130,379 asylum requests, three times as many as in all of 2014. Of those, 38,827 applications were filed by Syrians, who, if they continue their journey to Germany, would no longer be sent back.     An Austrian police spokesman said they had seen a “steep rise” in trafficking over the past month, adding they were arresting people smugglers almost every day. In some of the country’s overcrowded refugee camps, asylum seekers have to sleep on the ground or in tents under conditions that are “intolerable, dangerous, and beneath human dignity,” the U.N. refugee agency said.     At the Western Balkan conference in Vienna, where the migrant crisis was a main topic, Mr. Faymann and Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz urged new measures to address the refugee plight. Austrian officials said the EU must improve protection of its external borders, better supervise Western Balkan transit routes and improve refugee treatment inside the EU.     Mr. Faymann said Europe must adopt a system of binding quotas for refugees, to spread the migrant burden more evenly across the bloc.      Previous attempts by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to push for such a system of redistribution have failed. The commission plans in autumn to propose a new binding redistribution system in the face of the large influx of migrants.     “This is not an Austrian crisis. This is not an Italian, French, German or a Greek or a Hungarian crisis,” said European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Commissioner in charge of migration, in a joint statement. “This is a European crisis and it requires a collective European response.”     Earlier this week, Austrian police arrested three human traffickers carrying refugees in a van on the same highway. The driver in that incident had dropped off some 34 refugees, including 10 children, on the highway, after crossing the Austrian border from Hungary, police said.     The refugees told police they had been herded in the van and could hardly breathe. They said the driver had refused to stop between the Serbian border and Austria.     —Margit Feher and Valentina Pop contributed to this article.
