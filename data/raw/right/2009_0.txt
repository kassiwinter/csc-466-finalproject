                                                                                                                                         A visibly shaken and angry President Obama on Thursday attacked the American gun lobby, scolded the media and demanded that Congress take concrete action to stop the rash of recent mass shootings, which he said have “become routine” and are the pure result of inaction by lawmakers in Washington.                                                                                                                                                      Speaking in the briefing room at the White House, the president — who offered his 15th statement in the wake of a mass shooting — said the federal government must explain to grieving families why it has virtually nothing to stop tragedies like the one seen on the campus of Oregon’s Umpqua Community College Thursday.                                                                                                                                                      “This is a political choice we make — to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction,” Mr. Obama said.                                                                                                                                                                    A 20-year-old gunman killed at least 10 students and wounded 20 others on the Umpqua campus Thursday. His identity and motive have not been revealed.                                                                                                                              In addition to blasting Congress, the president directed his anger at the gun lobby and the news media. He said he expects Second Amendment activists to again argue we need fewer gun laws, not more.                                                                                                                                                                 “We need more guns, they’ll argue, fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?” he said. “There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know that’s not true.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      On media coverage of mass shootings, Mr. Obama said news outlets should highlight that fewer Americans are killed by radical terrorists than by deranged gunmen in America.                                                                                                                   “I would ask news organizations … tally up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side,” he said.
