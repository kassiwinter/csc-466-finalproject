Tiger Woods underwent emergency surgery Tuesday to repair significant damage to his right leg and ankle, his team said in a statement posted on his Twitter account late Tuesday night.Woods' team said in the statement that the golfer was "awake, responsive and recovering in his hospital room" at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center following the surgery. Woods, 45, sustained the injuries in a one-car crash in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on Tuesday morning.Anish Mahajan, the chief medical officer and interim CEO at the hospital, said in the statement that Woods had multiple open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of his right tibia and fibula, the two main bones in the lower leg. The bones were stabilized "by inserting a rod into the tibia," he added.Woods also suffered injuries to the bones in his right foot and ankle, which were stabilized using screws and pins, and to muscle and soft-tissue in the leg. Mahajan said doctors had to surgically release "the covering of the muscles to relieve pressure due to swelling.""Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by Orthopaedic trauma specialists at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center," Mahajan said.The statement did not explicitly mention any injuries or damage to Woods' left leg. Daryl Osby, the chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said at a news conference earlier Tuesday that he believed both of Woods' legs were seriously injured in the crash.STAY INFORMED:Keep up with updates on Tiger's injury, recovery.
