                                                                                                                                         New Jersey Democrats have subpoenaed documents from Gov. Chris Christie’s office and campaign in their legislative investigation into the bridge-closure scandal, along with records from 18 individuals, according to the complete list released Friday evening.                                                                                                                                                      Subpoenas went out to key senior staffers in Mr. Christie’s official office and his 2013 re-election campaign, as well as to Bridget Anne Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff whose email seemingly ordering the traffic problems in Fort Lee led to the scandal.                                                                                                                                                      The subpoenas specifically listed the governor’s office itself, and Christie for Governor Inc., his 2013 campaign, as targets.                                                                                                                                                                    The subpoenas were issued Thursday, just hours after the New Jersey Assembly voted to create a special investigative committee and give it subpoena authority. Democrats, who control the assembly, issued the subpoenas but withheld the names of the targets until they were all served.                                                                                                                   The first round of subpoenas is apparently only for documents.
