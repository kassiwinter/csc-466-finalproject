SINGAPORE—President      Donald Trump        launched a high-stakes diplomatic effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, betting that a friendlier approach with North Korea’s      Kim Jong Un        —including a surprise promise to halt military exercises with South Korea—would work better than intimidation.With the task ahead to make the agreement concrete, Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo    is scheduled to travel to Seoul on Wednesday for talks with South Korean and Japanese officials, followed by a trip to China. The decision to cancel the exercises, the refining of the timetables for denuclearization and possible future sanction relief are expected to be on the agenda. North Korea said Wednesday that Mr. Trump had told Mr. Kim he intended to halt U.S.-South Korea military exercises and lift sanctions against the North, suggesting through its state media that Mr. Trump had explicitly acceded to two longstanding North Korean demands during bilateral talks at their summit meeting a day earlier.        
Related         The North Korean report also quoted Mr. Trump as crediting Mr. Kim’s “proactive peace-loving measures” for having created the atmosphere of peace this year—not the president’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Pyongyang—and said the two leaders accepted each other’s invitations to visit their respective countries.               The report, published early Wednesday, put a distinctly North Korean spin on the meeting between the two leaders, the first between a sitting U.S. president and a leader of North Korea. The report also quoted Mr. Kim as saying that, if the U.S. were to take “genuine measures for building trust,” then the North could reciprocate in a “commensurate” fashion—a clear suggestion that U.S. concessions would have to come before any North Korean move.     Tuesday’s agreement, which Mr. Trump described as “very comprehensive” after decades of failed U.S. efforts, provided almost no particulars on how to come to a speedy denuclearization that was complete, verifiable and irreversible—oft-stated U.S. goals. Mr. Trump said he would maintain economic sanctions but would stop the “war games” with South Korea as negotiations with the North continue.     “We’re prepared to start a new history and we’re ready to write a new chapter between our nations,” Mr. Trump said.     As a result of these talks, Mr. Kim said, “the world will see a major change.”     Mr. Trump, who described Tuesday’s talks as honest, direct and productive, said after the summit that he was open to visiting Pyongyang and was ready to welcome Mr. Kim to the White House. Mr. Pompeo and national security adviser         John Bolton    plan to meet next week, possibly with their North Korean counterparts, to discuss next steps, the president said.     The document Messrs. Trump and Kim signed Tuesday didn’t set deadlines for action. Still to be answered are when North Korea will turn over its nuclear weapons, how the U.S. will verify that step, when punitive economic sanctions will be lifted and what type of U.S. security guarantees will be offered to Pyongyang.

Seib asks: Who might be in the spotlight over the next couple of months?

Prime Minister         Shinzo Abe    of Japan, after talking by phone with Mr. Trump, called the meeting a success but said it needed to be followed by swift action. “We will seek full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions based on the success of this historic meeting,” he said late Tuesday, adding the U.S.-North Korean agreement should be put into effect. “They must move forward swiftly.”     While Mr. Trump said the economic sanctions will remain, he said that a key link in the sanctions chain—North Korea’s border with China—had weakened recently, referring to administration charges that China’s enforcement of sanctions has eased, which Beijing denies.     “I think, over the last two months, the border is more open than it was when we first started,” Mr. Trump said. “But that is what it is.”     Mr. Trump, taking a step outside the formal U.S.-North Korean agreement, said he would stop U.S. and South Korean military exercises—an important signal for deterrence for South Korea and a constant irritant for the North—while negotiations are under way.     It would be inappropriate and disrespectful, the president said, to pursue the “war games” even though defense officials have said they are needed to maintain training for an ever-rotating staff of U.S. and Korean military who participate.     The move appeared to surprise many at the Pentagon and South Korean officials. Mr. Trump’s critics accused him of making a major concession before winning anything concrete from Mr. Kim. The U.S. has steadfastly refused to suspend joint military exercises in the past, despite North Korean demands.                                         After a historic summit in Singapore, President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un signed a document committing to work together for peace. Other highlights included mutual compliments, handshakes and a lunch with prawn cocktail.

A spokesman for U.S. Forces Korea said that it had received no new guidance on joint military maneuvers, including drills planned for the fall.     The decision came as a surprise to some U.S. military officers in South Korea, who didn’t know what would happen next and whether there would be a cancellation of training with the South Korean military, according to a person familiar with the matter.     Voicing concern, Japan’s defense minister         Itsunori Onodera,    said Wednesday that the exercises play an important role in preserving peace in East Asia.      A White House official said Tuesday that the U.S. military would continue to train with its South Korean counterparts and conduct military drills—but not large-scale, joint exercises.     The clarification, coming while Mr. Trump was still flying back from Singapore, was issued after Vice President      Mike Pence        spent much of the day meeting with lawmakers who sought to understand what the president had promised.                                         President Donald Trump said he showed Kim Jong Un a short video that laid out what peace could mean for North Korea.

Mattis and Trump. “He was not surprised, he was consulted,” Ms. White added. “There were no surprises.”     Mr. Trump won praise from some allies in Congress, but many lawmakers said they wanted more specifics about what would happen and when.     “While I am glad the president and Kim Jong Un were able to meet, it is difficult to determine what of [a] concrete nature has occurred,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Mike Rounds    (R., S.D.) wrote on Twitter the president “has made early strides in making our world a safer place.” He added: “A lot of work to do yet.”     Democrats were less optimistic, saying the Republican president gained little while giving Mr. Kim the benefit of greater world-wide credibility.      “By granting a meeting with Chairman Kim, President Trump has granted a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved,” said         Sen. Chuck Schumer    of New York, the chamber’s Democratic leader.
