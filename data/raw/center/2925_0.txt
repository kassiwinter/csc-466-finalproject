This article is more than 4 years old.  Last night at a Trump rally in Huntington, West Virginia, the state’s governor and only billionaire took the stage to announce he intended to flip sides, from the Democratic Party to the GOP.              Scott Halleran/Getty Images     “Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking,” Justice said to an enthusiastic crowd of Trump supporters. ”I can’t help you anymore being a Democrat governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican.”   The governor said his decision was grounded in his frustration to work with his own party in the states legislative branch. “The Democrats walked away from me,” Justice said. “There was way too much pain.”  Justice, who was elected Governor in November beating Republican nominee Bill Cole, ran an unorthodox campaign not too different from Trump, emphasizing his successes in business and holding up his lack of previous politic experience as a virtue.   This is not the first time Justice jumped the aisle. After being a registered Republican for most of his life, Justice switched to Democrat in 2014. During the campaign, he refused to throw his support behind Hillary Clinton citing her policies on coal, Justice’s original source of wealth.   “My mom and dad were staunch lovers of Ronald Reagan, staunch Republicans. My mom and dad, with no question in my mind, are in heaven right now, and they’re both saying the same thing, but my mom is saying it more profoundly: Jimmy, it’s about damn time you came to your senses,” Justice said yesterday.  Justice, worth nearly $1.6 billion, gets much of his fortune from the coal and agricultural companies he inherited from his father. He has also shown himself to be a prolific dealmaker. Most noteworthy perhaps is his investment in Bluestone mines which he sold to Russian mining company Mechel OAO in a cash and stock deal in 2009 for $550 million, only to buy it back in 2015 for just $5 million.   In more recent years, Justice has made himself know to West Virginians through his investment in the historic resort the Greenbrier, which he bought out of bankruptcy in 2009. According to his own accounts, he has invested more than $250 million in the resort.   Speaking at the event, Justice revealed that he had been to the Oval office twice over the last weeks to discuss how to open more coal mines and create manufacturing jobs in West Virginia. He also spoke of his great relationship with Trump’s children and some of his thought on national politics.  “What in world is wrong with us as people? Have we not heard enough about the Russians? I mean, to our God in our heaven above, think about it! The stock market is at 22,000. And this country has hope. And we’re on our way,” Justice said to the cheering crowd.  President Trump, who had teased “the very big announcement”, followed Justice’s address by saying that the pair showed that their agenda rises above left and right.  “Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor. I tell you. Such an honor,”‘said Trump.  Follow Max on Twitter at @Maxjedeur or email him at mpalmgren@forbes.com.
