                                                                                                                                         President Trump on Wednesday said he plans to ask for a “major investigation” into voter fraud, after the White House said Tuesday Mr. Trump believes that between 3 million and 5 million people could have voted illegally in the 2016 election.                                                                                                                                                      “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and … even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!” Mr. Trump tweeted.                                                                                                                                                      In a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House earlier this week, Mr. Trump apparently repeated an earlier contention that he would have won the popular vote had millions not voted illegally.                                                                                                                                                                    “I think he’s stated his concerns of voter fraud … and people voting illegally during the campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday.                                                                                                                              Rep. Chris Collins, New York Republican, said Wednesday that he would support anything to make sure elections are more secure and that only U.S. citizens vote.                                                                                                                                                                 “He’s certainly entitled to his own opinion, and that’s what he’s expressing,” Mr. Collins said on CNN’s “New Day.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said later on the program that an investigation during the George W. Bush administration turned up no voter fraud.                                                                                                                   “He seems to be questioning the legitimacy of his own election, all while for the last couple of months touting how legitimate and huge his election was and how historic it is,” said Mrs. Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat. “It can’t be both.”
