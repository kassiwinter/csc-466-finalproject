Saudi Arabia has charted a long-term course to drive down oil prices and maintain its major share of the global market—and a change of who is on the throne in Riyadh won’t likely alter this course, energy experts said.Even after the death of King Abdullah, announced early Friday, the kingdom is likely to continue to pump crude in the face of a global glut, which has helped push prices down by more than 55% since last June. Surrounded by unrest and uncertainty in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is protecting itself by exploiting its big advantages—huge oil reserves and low-cost crude production, said Sarah Emerson, principal of ESAI Energy LLC in Boston.        
More        “They need to make sure they have enough market share for not just tomorrow but 2040 and 2060 and beyond to ensure longevity,” Ms. Emerson said. The Saudis embarked on this new strategy in reaction to the U.S. oil boom, and it is a new status quo that won’t change under a new king, she said.               That doesn’t mean that in the short term, oil traders won’t be nervous about the ascension to the throne of the new king, Salman, or that oil markets won’t be volatile.     The U.S. oil benchmark, which had risen as much as 3.1% in overnight trading, turned lower during the morning session, down 21 cents, or 0.4%, at $46.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.     Investors who had bet on lower prices likely closed out positions on the chance that the king’s death could lead to a change in Saudi Arabia’s stance, said Nader Naeimi, a fund manager in Sydney, at AMP Capital, which oversees more than $120 billion in assets.     “Given how far oil has fallen, markets are increasingly responsive to any kind of news that may be positive for prices,” he said. “Whether it is going to be durable isn’t clear for now.”     Some investors don’t think the new Saudi king will affect the policy of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “I don’t think it should have an impact on the oil price,” said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of $450 million London hedge fund Andurand Capital Management LLP, whose fund posted large gains in 2014 betting on lower oil prices.     The country’s current strategy has the backing of its powerful oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, so investors and traders will be watching for the possibility that a change of oil ministers could be afoot. Some Saudi experts say it is unclear if the behind-the-scenes power struggle over who has influence over King Salman is finished and whether the kingdom’s princes have coalesced around him.     Mr. al-Naimi, 79, has headed the oil ministry since 1995, during which time he has become one of the most closely watched figures in global oil markets. He has previously said he had hoped he could dedicate more time to King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, where he serves as chairman.                                                                                                                                                     “Despite efforts in Riyadh to make everything appear smooth, there are some big questions out there,” said         Simon Henderson,    director of the Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute.     King Salman, in his previous capacity as crown prince, said in a speech on behalf of the late monarch earlier this month that the kingdom would continue to deal with the challenge posed by falling crude prices with a “firm will.”     Traditionally, the kingdom’s top decision-making body on oil is the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals, which is led by the king and includes senior royal family members, ministers including Mr. al-Naimi and top industry executives.     But the Supreme Council hasn’t issued any statement on oil prices for months and key decisions have recently been made by Mr.al-Naimi, with the backing of the late king.     Saudi industry officials have said that King Salman is likely to retain the long-standing oil minister at least in the short term. Traditionally incoming kings have chosen to appoint new ministers to lead key ministries like oil.     If the king opts for finding a successor the best-suited candidates to replace him are likely to be the chief executive of the state-owned giant Saudi Aramco Khalid Al-Falih or Salam’s own son Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the current deputy oil minister who attends most OPEC meetings.     The world’s top oil exporter, however, has never chosen a royal to serve as oil minister.     Last year, the secretive kingdom saw an unusually high level of internal debate over how to respond to oil’s downturn.     In early October, the country’s representative to OPEC surprised attendees at a New York seminar by revealing his government was content to let global energy prices slide.     But as the oil-price slide accelerated, Prince Abdulaziz worried to colleagues that the kingdom’s budget couldn’t bear lower prices long, people familiar with the matter said.     Saudi Arabia controls more than 15% of the world’s proven oil reserves and vies with Russia and the U.S. for the title of biggest petroleum producer in the world. As American companies have pumped soaring amounts of oil from shale, Saudi Arabia’s exports to the U.S. have fallen, dropping to 25.6 million barrels a month in October. But it remained the third-largest supplier to the U.S. after Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.     After oil prices began dropping from their triple-digit peak in late June, traders looked to Saudi Arabia to cut production to prop up prices, as it did in the 1980s. But in November, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries voted to keep pumping the same amount of oil, and that isn’t likely to change soon, said         Amy Myers Jaffe,    an energy observer at the University of California Davis.     “Not only did the Saudis signal a smooth transition, they are transferring power to a faction that tends to feel that the alliance with the U.S. should be a priority,” she said. “Whatever succession issues may hit the royal family one day…we aren’t at that moment in time.”                                                 A Saudi Aramco oil installion in the desert near the oil-rich area of Khouris.
