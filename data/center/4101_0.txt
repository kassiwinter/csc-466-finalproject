Lindsey GrahamLindsey Olin GrahamThe conservative case for nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court The Hill's Morning Report - World poised for war Anxious Democrats want Biden to speed up vetting for Supreme Court pick MORE (R-S.C.), a close ally of Trump’s, predicted that the president wouldn’t be actively whipping senators since the veto override was likely to fail in the House.“I don’t think he’s calling anybody,” Graham said.The Senate is set to vote on the resolution of disapproval before they leave town for a weeklong recess on March 15. All 47 members of the Democratic Caucus are expected to support it, and four Republicans have now offered their public backing, providing a majority.Sen.

Underscoring the breadth of concern, the swath of undecided senators includes libertarian-leaning Republicans, moderates and typical McConnell and Trump allies.Sen. James InhofeJames (Jim) Mountain InhofeSenate leaders send Putin symbolic warning shot amid invasion fears Russia crisis exacerbates US political divisions Overnight Defense & National Security — White House raises new alarm over Russia MORE (R-Okla.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Monday that the emergency declaration is “dead in the water” in the Senate.“I may vote against it because we don’t know for sure how that’s going to affect the military,” Inhofe told KRMG, an Oklahoma radio station, on Monday.Trump announced that he would declare a national emergency to construct the U.S.-Mexico border wall after Congress passed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for physical barriers, well below the $5.7 billion the president requested.He’s hoping to pull together roughly $8 billion for the wall by combining the money from Congress with executive actions and using the national emergency to reshuffle military construction funding.Several undecided Republican senators said Monday that they hadn’t heard from the administration about the Senate’s vote.“Maybe they’re considering it, hopefully,” said Sen.

The party has been wary of breaking with Trump on border security, which has emerged as a lightning rod among the party’s base. But they’ve also been frank about their concerns that Trump is setting up a legal precedent a future Democratic president could use to jam through policies Republicans are opposed to.McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2020, illustrated the political tightrope Monday by saying that while he was supporting Trump’s emergency declaration, he had also unsuccessfully lobbied the president against choosing the controversial step.McConnell told reporters that he was “hoping the president would not take the national emergency route.”“Yeah, I am, that’s one reason I argued, obviously without success, to the president that he not take this route,” McConnell added, asked if he was concerned about a future Democratic president using the precedent.Republicans are trying to work through if they can make changes to the resolution of disapproval to make it more palatable to their caucus, but are basically in uncharted territory. Lawmakers previously threatened to challenge former President George W. Bush’s 2005 emergency declaration, but he backed down.McConnell noted Monday that they are consulting the parliamentarian.“It’s never been done before,” McConnell said. “We’ve been looking and talking … about what options there are if any.”Sen. Roy BluntRoy Dean BluntOvernight Health Care — Biden eyes additional COVID-19 funding Biden administration eyes billion for COVID-19 funding in talks with Congress Senate confirms Biden FDA nominee MORE (Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, added that the resolution is “so narrow that I don’t think that’s a realistic possibility.”“We’re not the final vote yet,” Blunt added. “I’d still like to see the president take another course if he could.”
