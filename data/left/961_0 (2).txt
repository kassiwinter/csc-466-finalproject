  JOE BOf course Saudi Arabia is ok with the US killing innocent Syrians. Saudi Arabia funds Al Qaeda and is part of the radical islamists that want to take over the middle east.  
Common sense obviously is not what the WH is using, as the Syrian government was winning the war against the Al Qaeda rebels so they had no reason to use chemical weapons. On the other hand the Al Qaeda rebels have no problem killing people in anyway they can. Just remember 12 years almost to this on 911, Al Qaeda killed thousands of innocent Americans at the New York Trade Center Twin Towers. Now Obama, McCain, Boehner and Kerry is on the side of the Al Qaeda killers. Our leaders are committing an act of treason against the American people and the people of Syria.
