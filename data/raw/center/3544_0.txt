The Senate’s 51-to-48 vote for         Brian Benczkowski    came one year after he was nominated to the post and as the Justice Department continues to struggle with a lack of permanent, politically appointed leaders to oversee many of its most important units.      Department officials say the high-profile vacancies have strained resources and made it difficult to set and execute long-term priorities. The agency recently set aside its search for the No. 3 official, focusing instead on other nominees still awaiting confirmation.     Mr. Benczkowski, 48 years old, was a Justice Department official during the Bush administration and later served as Republican staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. He also helped manage Mr. Trump’s transition team for the Justice Department.               Mr. Sessions, now attorney general, on Wednesday praised Mr. Benczkowski’s “diverse public service and criminal law background.” In addition to his government service, Mr. Benczkowski worked for the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.     “At a time like this, with surging violent crime and an unprecedented drug epidemic, this position is especially important,” Mr. Sessions said.     The Criminal Division handles specialized criminal prosecutions around the country and is at the helm of some of the highest profile federal cases.     Mr. Benczkowski’s nomination stalled when Democrats criticized his lack of prosecutorial experience and his representation of Alfa Bank, which drew attention in 2016 after news reports of a possible server connection between the bank and the Trump Organization. The bank said it was targeted by hackers who created a fake cyber trail to suggest extensive links with businesses owned by Mr. Trump.     Mr. Benczkowski said during his confirmation hearing that he would recuse himself from any matters involving the bank for at least two years.     But Democrats said his appointment would hurt the Justice Department’s investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election meddling, which is overseen by Special Counsel         Robert Mueller.    Mr. Benczkowski has said he wouldn’t broadly recuse himself from that probe.     “Confirming Benczkowski puts that investigation in jeopardy,” said         Sen. Dianne Feinstein    of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.     A bipartisan group of former Justice Department officials has expressed their support for him, saying he would “work hard to protect the independence and integrity of this important institution.”     Write to Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
