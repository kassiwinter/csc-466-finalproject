 
News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg held an immigration forum in Boston on Tuesday night, the second of two held in two cities that day to press both President Obama and Mitt Romney on immigration reform. The Chicago event featured former White House chief of staff William Daley. In Boston, Murdoch was the featured guest for Bloomberg and, via the Boston Globe, he questioned Mitt Romney's approach to Hispanic voters:
Both Murdoch and Bloomberg said they were mystified that Romney hasn’t done more to reach out to Latino voters by outlining plans to ease immigration rules and resolve the legal status of immigrants already here.
“Give them a path to citizenship,” Murdoch said. “They pay taxes. They are hard-working people. Why Mitt Romney doesn’t do it, I have no idea because they are naturally Republicans.”
Bloomberg added: “The Republicans walking away from the Latino community is about as dumb a strategy as any political party has ever adopted. "
Bloomberg has had equally tough words for the White House on this topic. While the mayor, who contemplated running for president himself, is clearly looking to have a voice in the national conversation, the fact that the two presidential campaigns have been fighting, again, over dog rides and dog meat today is a reminder of why he has an opening to do so.
