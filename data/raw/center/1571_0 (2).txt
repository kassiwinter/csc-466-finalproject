WASHINGTON—Revelations that House Majority Whip         Steve Scalise    spoke to a white nationalist group in 2002 have Republicans fending off questions about race just as the party is set to take total control of Congress.Mr. Scalise appears to have weathered the first rush of stories about his speech to the group, founded in Louisiana by         David Duke,    a former Ku Klux Klan leader. House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) and Majority Leader         Kevin McCarthy    released statements Tuesday supporting Mr. Scalise, just as the 49-year-old GOP congressman from Louisiana said in his own statement that the appearance is “a mistake I regret.” The Scalise matter was a new headache for the GOP House leaders just after they appeared to be getting past another with the resignation of Rep.         Michael Grimm    (R., N.Y.), a week after he pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Boehner had urged Mr. Grimm to resign.     In the case of Mr. Scalise, the speaker’s endorsement suggests he is betting that the Louisiana lawmaker’s decision to address the group was an isolated event and wasn’t part of a larger pattern.                “More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate,” Mr. Boehner said. “Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character. He has my full confidence as our whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans.”                  “It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.”                — U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) concerning his address to a White Nationalist Group in 2002.             Mr. Scalise, the most conservative member of the GOP leadership, holds the No. 3 position in the House. His office said Monday that at the time he addressed the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, he had only one staffer as he campaigned against a state ballot initiative, and didn’t know who was in every group to which he spoke. That staffer was         Cameron Henry,    who is now a Louisiana state legislator. Mr. Henry didn’t return phone messages left with his office Tuesday. Mr. Henry’s brother, Charles Henry, is Mr. Scalise’s chief of staff. He also didn’t return messages.      Mr. Scalise said Tuesday he spoke to many different Louisiana groups 12 years ago as a state representative trying to build support for legislation to cut spending, eliminate government corruption and stop tax hikes. “One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn,” he said. “It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold. I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain.”     Mr. Scalise said that these groups hold views conflicting with his Catholic faith and that he rejects “that kind of hateful bigotry.”     “Those who know me best know I have always been passionate about helping, serving, and fighting for every family that I represent. And I will continue to do so,” he said.     Mr. Duke, who served in the Louisiana state legislature and placed second in the state’s 1991 governor’s race, said in an interview Tuesday that he has never had a relationship with Mr. Scalise, who he said was invited to speak by a political aide.         Related Reading        Mr. Duke said he doesn’t recall what Mr. Scalise said at the 2002 event, which Mr. Duke addressed by teleconference from Russia. But he said Mr. Scalise shouldn’t suffer political damage because he appeared at the event.      “It’s not fair to Scalise because I had no relationship, political or otherwise, with Scalise,” Mr. Duke said. “You have to understand that in this period of Louisiana history, I was one of the most popular politicians in the state, particularly among European Americans.”     Democrats had pressured House GOP leaders to condemn Mr. Scalise, who was elected to the leadership post last year amid support from southern Republicans eager to see a more conservative voice in the lineup.     A spokesman for House Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) sought to tie Mr. Scalise’s decade-old appearance to contemporary Republican policy.      “Just this year, House Republicans have refused to restore the Voting Rights Act or pass comprehensive immigration reform, and leading Republican members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group, the American Center for Law and Justice, which is seeking to overturn the president’s immigration executive actions,” spokesman         Drew Hammill    said.     The focus on race has increased since grand juries in New York and Missouri declined to indict white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men.         Daniel Donovan,    the GOP Staten Island prosecutor whose office presented evidence to the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in the death of         Eric Garner,    said he is considering running for Mr. Grimm’s seat.
