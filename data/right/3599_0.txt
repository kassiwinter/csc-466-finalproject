NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!  LOS ANGELES – The West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution Monday night asking to have President Trump's star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, according to a tweet by the city’s mayor.“West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,” announced Mayor John Duran on Twitter.Trump was awarded his star on the prestigious stretch of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, Calif. in 2007 during the height of his “Apprentice” fame, and it has been defaced and vandalized numerous times since he has been in office.“The West Hollywood City Council did not pass the resolution because Donald Trump is a conservative or a Republican. Earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an honor.  When one belittles and attacks minorities, immigrants, Muslims, people with disabilities or women - the honor no longer exists,“ Mayor Duran told Fox News in a statement.The resolution will be shared with the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It's worth noting that the mayor's office has no direct authority over the Walk of Fame and the decision will ultimately be up to the Chamber of Commerce.
