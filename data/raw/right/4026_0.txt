                                                                                                                                         Special counsel Robert Mueller is close to finishing his sprawling 20-month investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and other crimes, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Monday.                                                                                                                                                      “The investigation is, I think, close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from director Mueller as soon … as possible,” Mr. Whitaker said at a news conferencing announcing charges agains one of China’s largest smartphone makers.                                                                                                                                                      “I have been fully briefed on the investigation and I look forward to director Mueller delivering the report and I really am not going to talk about an open and ongoing investigation,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Whitaker is the first Justice Department official to announce on record that the Mueller probe is close to completion.                                                                                                                   It is unclear if Mr. Whitaker will still be acting attorney general when the investigation wraps up. President Trump’s nominee to replace him, William Barr, could be confirmed soon.
