DES MOINES, Iowa—Former Secretary of State         Hillary Clinton    barely survived a surprisingly stiff challenge from Sen.         Bernie Sanders    in the Iowa caucuses, as the two candidates arrived in New Hampshire Tuesday morning to begin a weeklong dash to the nation’s first primary.The Iowa Democratic Party declared the caucuses “historically close.” With all precincts reporting, the party’s tabulations put Mrs. Clinton’s delegate count at 49.8%, to Mr. Sanders’s 49.6%. “The results tonight are the closest in Iowa Democratic caucus history,” said         Andy McGuire,    chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party.     Mrs. Clinton declared victory early Tuesday morning after a campaign in which she argued that she is the one who can advance the Democratic agenda, and with a sophisticated ground operation that her campaign began building on the day she announced her candidacy in April. Sen. Sanders, a Vermont independent who attracted large and passionate crowds with his clarion call for a political revolution and an unabashedly liberal agenda, hadn’t yet conceded Iowa early Tuesday.               After that razor-thin outcome in their first matchup, both candidates came to New Hampshire claiming a jolt of momentum as they prepared to hit the trail. Sanders campaign officials said they had successfully fought to a draw with a formidable opponent.                                         Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said his neck-and-neck race with Hillary Clinton in the Iowa Democratic Caucus is indicative of a “political revolution.” Photo: Getty                                                                                                     Meantime,         Brian Fallon,    a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that “we believe strongly that we won tonight.” Speaking to reporters after midnight as the Clinton press plane prepared to depart Iowa for New Hampshire, he added: “Sen. Sanders has been saying for several weeks that if this caucus was a high turnout affair that he would win. He was wrong.”     Both candidates were digging in for what promises to be a protracted campaign, and far from the coronation many expected when Mrs. Clinton launched her candidacy in April.     Addressing her supporters in Des Moines, Mrs. Clinton signaled a long battle ahead between her brand of pragmatism and his call for a political revolution.     “It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now: to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for.” She added that she was “breathing a big sigh of relief.”     Mr. Sanders, addressing his own supporters, claimed a measure of victory of his own.          “I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message,” Mr. Sanders told cheering supporters. “It’s just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.” His cheering supporters replied, “Feel the Bern!”     The outcome offered a measure of vindication for Mrs. Clinton, whose third-place finish in Iowa eight years ago made clear that her once-inevitable campaign faced a serious threat from another challenger, then-Sen.         Barack Obama.         Still, Mr. Sanders’s success exposes real vulnerabilities with her candidacy.     Both candidates flew overnight to New Hampshire to begin a week-long sprint to the Granite State primary, where Mr. Sanders is 18 points ahead of Mrs. Clinton, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls. With strong fundraising, Mr. Sanders is positioned to press forward for the foreseeable future, though the Clinton campaign sees advantages in the states that come later in the month.     A third candidate, former Maryland Gov.         Martin O’Malley,    finished far behind the two leaders and dropped out Monday night.                                         Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fought a tight contest in Iowa's Democratic caucuses, where a coin-toss determined the outcome in a Davenport precinct.                                                                                                     The Iowa results were delivered from precincts across 99 counties after a 10-month campaign that showered attention on this rural Midwestern state, which has long taken pride in its role as the first stop on the road to the presidential nomination.     In a sweltering school lunchroom in Windsor Heights, a suburb of Des Moines, Clinton backers wooed their neighbors with offers of bottled water. A few miles away, in Clive, Sanders supporters ran out of seats so stood against the wall, beneath Sanders signs reading, “A Future to Believe In.”     Over dozens of trips to Iowa high schools and diners, in small discussions and big rallies, the two leading candidates engaged in a vigorous and sometimes sharp debate as Mrs. Clinton positioned herself as a pragmatic, can-do fighter, while Mr. Sanders appealed to the party’s most deeply held ideals.     She battled reports that classified material was sent via her private email system. He battled suggestions that he couldn’t win a general election, and that he has no real plan to implement his agenda.     On Monday, some Clinton supporters said they were drawn to Mr. Sanders but, in the end, concluded his call for a political revolution would be easier said than done—a point Mrs. Clinton voiced repeatedly.        
Election 2016        “I think he’s wonderful man, but I don’t think what he says is realistic,” said         Michelle Wilson,    a corporate compliance administrator from West Des Moines. She served as a precinct captain for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008; on Monday, she came to caucus for Mrs. Clinton.     But in Clive, west of Des Moines,         Carol Ferrell,    59, decided at the last minute to support Mr. Sanders. “As much as I admire Hillary Clinton, she’s got a lot of baggage,” she said.     And Mr. Sanders inspired voters who said they were attracted to his rejection of big-money politics and his promise of a “political revolution” that would upend that status quo. He drew large, energetic crowds to arenas and a loyal online following, where backers taunted detractors to “feel the Bern.”     Beyond their platforms, the battle was waged over who best turned out their supporters. Mr. Sanders repeatedly warned his large and enthusiastic crowds that he would lose if they didn’t show up to caucus.     But Mrs. Clinton, after being outmaneuvered in 2008, relied on a network of field staffers and volunteers that her campaign has been building for months. And late Monday, Clinton aides claimed victory, saying there was a big turnout—as Mr. Sanders had hoped for—and yet she still tied him.     In Van Meter, about a half-hour to the west, Agriculture Secretary         Tom Vilsack,    a former Iowa governor and Clinton supporter, marveled at the turnout for his precinct.     “My wife got a call at five in the afternoon, asking if she was going to caucus,” he said. “Then they asked, ‘Is your husband home, and is he caucusing?’”     Ahead of the balloting, the Sanders campaign said that a narrow defeat would do nothing to stop his forward progress, and he has the money to compete long-term.     In January, Mr. Sanders raised $20 million, and with most of his donations well below the legal limit, he can go back to his donors for more.     “The thing that generally ends campaigns is lack of resources,” said         David Axelrod,    who helped steer President Barack Obama’s two victories. “This does not seem to be a problem for the Sanders campaign.”     Ahead of the balloting, Sanders strategist         Tad Devine    said, “We’ve done what we came to do, which is establish him as a serious candidate.”     The Clinton campaign was bracing for a loss in New Hampshire, the state that rescued         Bill Clinton’s    1992 campaign and revived Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 effort.     “There are a lot of headwinds in New Hampshire,” Clinton campaign manager         Robby Mook    said in an interview, noting that candidates from neighboring states, like Mr. Sanders, have almost always won New Hampshire in recent years.     But the campaign feels optimistic looking ahead. Mr. Mook pointed to Mrs. Clinton’s strong position in Nevada and South Carolina and in the swath of Southern states that will award a quarter of the delegates at stake on March 1.                                         Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley suspended his campaign Monday after receiving less than 1% in the Iowa caucuses.                                                                                                     These states, where the Clinton campaign began organizing last summer, have more nonwhite voters than the states in the first two contests. Mrs. Clinton polls strongly among these voters and would continue to emphasize matters important to African-Americans, including her association with Mr. Obama, gun restrictions and the water crisis in Flint, Mich.     The candidates offer Democrats with two very different visions for governing.     In speeches that remained almost identical across months of campaigning, Mr. Sanders promised to break up large banks, said Wall Street is built on fraud and unapologetically vowed to impose higher taxes to provide universal health care, free tuition at public colleges and more generous Social Security benefits. At a rally Saturday, as Mr. Sanders ticked off society’s problems, the crowd spontaneously began chanting, “Enough is enough!”     Mrs. Clinton, for her part, highlighted her perseverance and qualifications for the presidency, including four years as secretary of state, along with what she describes as a pragmatic, effective approach to governing. She also portrayed herself as the most electable candidate whose nomination is necessary to block Republican ideas.     Her policy platform includes a new program for debt-free tuition and an increase in solar panels, as well as changes in health care and Social Security that are more modest than her rival’s.     Her supporters, including many older women who grew up in a time of outright sex discrimination, say they were inspired by the idea of electing the first female president. And backers often say she is the most qualified candidate for the presidency they have ever encountered.     On Monday night,         Deidre Fudge    arrived early to her West Des Moines caucus to register support for Mrs. Clinton.     “I’m just a little worried about Bernie and his naiveté,” Ms. Fudge said. “I appreciate her experience and levelheadedness about what can actually get done.”          —         Natalie Andrews    contributed to this article.
