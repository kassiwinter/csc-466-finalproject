WASHINGTON—House Democrats intensified their investigations into President Trump and his associates Monday, demanding records from more than 80 people and organizations related to his business dealings, interactions with the Justice Department and communications with Russian President      Vladimir Putin.        The requests marked the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort by Congress to investigate the president since Democrats took control of the House two months ago. The requests cover nearly every aspect of the president’s orbit that has come under investigation by special counsel         Robert Mueller,    federal prosecutors in Manhattan and other investigators during the two years Mr. Trump has been in office.         Related        Letters sent by the House Judiciary Committee indicate that the panel—which has the power to begin impeachment proceedings—is seeking to build a case against the Republican president and his associates to determine whether their findings merit an attempt to oust him from office.     “We have sent these document requests in order to begin building the public record,” said Rep.         Jerrold Nadler    (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. “We will act quickly to gather this information, assess the evidence, and follow the facts where they lead with full transparency with the American people.”               White House press secretary         Sarah Sanders    on Monday called the Judiciary Committee’s investigation “disgraceful and abusive” in a statement. “Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats have embarked on this fishing expedition because they are terrified that their two-year false narrative of ‘Russia collusion’ is crumbling,” she said. “The Democrats are not after the truth, they are after the President.”      Mr. Trump, asked if he would comply with the committee’s document requests, said he cooperates “all the time with everybody” and added: “It’s all a hoax.”      The House Judiciary panel, which is conducting wide-ranging investigations into obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power, sent document requests on Monday to a range of Trump associates, from his former White House staff; executives from his real-estate business, the Trump Organization, including the president’s sons; and officials who worked for the transition and inaugural committees.     Mr. Trump has denied obstructing justice, which Mr. Mueller is also investigating as part of his probe into whether Mr. Trump’s associates coordinated with Russia during the 2016 U.S. election. Both Mr. Trump and Russia have denied any collusion.     Mr. Nadler said on ABC News on Sunday that he believed the president had obstructed justice by repeatedly attacking the investigations into his associates and his business dealings and by criticizing those who have spoken to investigators, which Mr. Nadler said amounted to witness intimidation.     Also on Monday, the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees wrote in letters to acting White House chief of staff         Mick Mulvaney    and Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo    that they were investigating what Messrs. Trump and Putin discussed in in-person and phone conversations.      Mr. Trump didn’t have official note takers present in his introductory meeting with Mr. Putin in 2017, and many top administration officials were never briefed on the discussion, according to several officials familiar with the matter. The president went to “extraordinary lengths” to keep his discussions with Mr. Putin from leaking, according to one person familiar with the planning, including preventing any details from the meeting from circulating widely within the government.

The lawmakers, in a broad document request, said they are also probing the effect of those Trump-Putin discussions on U.S. foreign policy and whether the president “or anyone acting on his behalf have sought to conceal” the communications or failed to create records about them.      The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, appears to be pursuing several lines of inquiry in its document requests. These areas include whether the president, his company or his inaugural committee violated a constitutional provision barring officeholders from accepting money from foreign governments; efforts by his company during the 2016 campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow; and his decision to fire Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey while the agency’s Russia investigation was under way.     The Judiciary Committee will for the first time probe, among other areas, Mr. Trump’s real-estate business, which is under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan but has received little congressional scrutiny to date.      The panel sent requests to a half-dozen current or former executives at the Trump Organization, including         Donald Trump Jr.    and         Eric Trump    —the president’s sons who are running the business while he is in office—as well as         Allen Weisselberg,    the company’s longtime chief financial officer;         Alan Garten,    the chief legal officer; and         Rhona Graff,    the president’s former longtime assistant. The committee also sent a letter to Michael Cohen, a former longtime lawyer at the company who testified last week before the House Oversight Committee.                                          During a dramatic and partisan hearing Wednesday, President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen testified on a range of topics.

The panel also is seeking documents from American Media Inc. and its chief executive, David Pecker, which paid one of the women, a former Playboy model, during the campaign to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump, according to court filings. Mr. Cohen has said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange the payments. The president has denied the encounters and any wrongdoing in the matter.     The Judiciary Committee also contacted         Keith Davidson,    a former lawyer for both women who received the hush-money payments, requesting documents related to the payments and discussions surrounding them. Mr. Davidson in a statement Monday said he would cooperate with the committee and requested that it issue a subpoena for the documents.     One of the president’s lawyers,         Jay Sekulow,    and a former lawyer, Mark Corallo, were requested to provide documents related to the president’s interactions with Justice Department officials, including former Acting Attorney General         Matthew Whitaker,    former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein.    The letter also seeks documents related to “possible pardons” for Mr. Cohen, former Trump campaign chairman         Paul Manafort    and former national security adviser         Mike Flynn.         “We are reviewing the request for documents and we will respond at the appropriate time,” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement.      The committee also sent a letter to the White House, requesting communications about the termination of Mr. Flynn, as well as communications regarding Mr. Comey around the time of his firing, and other matters. Among the former White House officials contacted were onetime communications director         Hope Hicks,    former chief of staff         Reince Priebus    and former chief strategist         Steve Bannon.         The committee will allow two weeks for recipients of the document requests to voluntarily cooperate before considering whether to subpoena them, a panel aide said.     The committee also contacted Cambridge         Analytica,    a data-analytics company that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and turned over documents to Mr. Mueller in 2017, as well as associates of the late Peter Smith, a Republican operative who sought to obtain what he believed to be emails stolen from         Hillary Clinton.    It also contacted top officials on the president’s inaugural committee, including its chairman,         Tom Barrack,    and deputy chairman,         Rick Gates.         “Over the last several years, President Trump has evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical, and constitutional rules and norms,” Mr. Nadler said in a statement Monday. “Investigating these threats to the rule of law is an obligation of Congress and a core function of the House Judiciary Committee.”     The Judiciary Committee is one of several congressional panels that plans to seek testimony or documents from Mr. Weisselberg and other Trump Organization executives following Mr. Cohen’s testimony last week, when he accused the president of committing a range of crimes, including falsifying loan documents, evading taxes and covering up hush-money payments to a porn star during the presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen for the first time also implicated Mr. Weisselberg in the scheme to pay off the porn star, Stephanie Clifford, and to subsequently try to cover it up.     Mr. Weisselberg testified before a grand jury last summer in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office investigation of Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, and he was granted immunity, The Wall Street Journal has reported.      Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty on nine felony counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison, starting May 6.     —Dustin Volz contributed to this article.
