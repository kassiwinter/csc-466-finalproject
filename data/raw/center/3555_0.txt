WASHINGTON—A day after questioning the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, President      Donald Trump        reversed course on Tuesday, saying he accepted its conclusion. Mr. Trump, whose comments at his news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki prompted a backlash in Congress and criticism from some of his allies, offered his “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies.” Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump said he has “strong respect” for intelligence agencies and noted “tremendous talent” within the U.S. intelligence community. Even as he acknowledged Russia’s role, Mr. Trump left open the idea that there “could be others too,” and he repeated his assertion that there was no collusion with his campaign.     The president said his administration had no plans to lift sanctions on Russia and would work hard to thwart further attempts at Russian election meddling in the U.S. “We will stop it, we will repel it,” he said. “We’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.”               Mr. Trump told reporters that he had reviewed the transcripts of the news conference and realized that he had misspoken at one key point. Asked at Monday’s summit whom he believed—U.S. intelligence agencies or Mr. Putin—Mr. Trump said         Dan Coats,    the director of national intelligence, “came to me [and] said, they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it’s not Russia.”          He then said, “I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.”     Mr. Trump on Tuesday said that he had meant to say, “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia.”      Earlier Tuesday, lawmakers from both parties reiterated assertions that Russia is a U.S. adversary. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that there was “indisputable evidence” that Russia had interfered with the U.S. election, and that Moscow was no friend to the U.S.                                         President Trump’s cordial meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin was in sharp contrast to his more combative meetings with NATO allies last week.

There should be no doubt about that,” he said, while adding that the Russian interference didn’t have a “material effect” on the election’s outcome.     Mr. Ryan was pressed on a Republican-authored House Intelligence Committee report that concluded in March there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Putin preferred Mr. Trump over         Hillary Clinton    in the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Putin said himself during Monday’s news conference that he wanted Mr. Trump to win.              U.S. Sen. John Barrasso    (R., Wyo.), a member of the Senate GOP leadership, said in a statement that he believes Russia indeed interfered in the U.S. election and that both Mr. Putin “and his regime” should endure “further consequences” as a result of Russian meddling.          But many lawmakers expressed relief Tuesday after the president spoke. “I’m glad he clarified what he said yesterday,” said         Sen. John Thune    of South Dakota, a member of Senate GOP leadership. “Obviously many of us had real concerns about what he said yesterday and expressed those.”      Many Democrats remained skeptical of Mr. Trump’s claim that he simply misspoke on Monday. Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) said Mr. Trump’s latest comments came “24 hours too late.”               Sen. Rand Paul    (R., Ky.) was among the few Republican lawmakers who consistently publicly supported Mr. Trump after the summit. On Tuesday, Mr. Paul said he welcomed Mr. Trump’s clarification over his comments on whether Russia was involved in election interference.           “I think he’s been completely and unfairly criticized by the media and by the left and by the neoconservatives,” he said.      Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Putin came after tense discussions with member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels last week over their failure to meet alliance guidelines for military spending. Mr. Trump then traveled to the U.K., where he criticized the Brexit policies of Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with a British newspaper. Mr. Trump later apologized to Mrs. May.     —Peter Nicholas and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.      Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
