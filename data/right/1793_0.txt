A rare winter storm in Texas is battering the state with heavy snow, ice and bitterly cold temperatures. Every county in the Lone Star State is under a state of emergency as the winter weather extends all the way to the southern border. “Every part of the state will face freezing conditions over the coming days, and I urge all Texans to remain vigilant against the extremely harsh weather that is coming,” said Governor Abbott, according to AccuWeather. “Stay off the roads, take conscious steps to conserve energy, and avoid dangerous practices like bringing generators indoors or heating homes with ovens or stovetops.” Major cities — including San Antonio, Dallas and Houston — can see several inches of additional snow by the time the precipitation moves out on Monday, according to forecasters. Higher snowfall totals are expected in the northern part of the state — where up to 18 inches could accumulate, according to AccuWeather. 
On Sunday night, heavy snow was falling in the border town of Del Rio, according to footage posted to Twitter. As the winter weather moves east of Texas on Monday, frigid air will filter in, lasting for several days, according to forecasters.
