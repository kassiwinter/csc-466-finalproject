                                                                                                                                         Would businessman Donald Trump pick former Alaska Gov. and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for a government post if he wins the presidency?                                                                                                                                                      Speaking on “The Palin Update” show on Mama Grizzly Radio this week, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Palin is a “great person.”                                                                                                                                                      Asked if he could see picking up the phone and “picking her brain” on some things or perhaps “having her along in some official capacity” if elected, Mr. Trump said, “I’d love that.”                                                                                                                                                                    “She really is somebody that knows what’s happening, and she’s a special person. She really is a special person,” he said. “And I think people know that, and she’s got a following that’s unbelievable. I still have people saying, ‘Oh, get Sarah’s support, get Sarah’s support’ no matter where I go. Everybody loves her.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               He said they also both have people who aren’t exactly fans of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 “She’s an amazing woman … and she’s given great credit, but she should be given even more credit, because she is somebody that people respect and admire, and she speaks [for] so many people,” he said. “I don’t even think she knows how important she is, OK? And maybe that’s part of the beauty of Sarah Palin. But I just see it all over and so many people revere her, and so I just think it’s great. I think she’s terrific.”
