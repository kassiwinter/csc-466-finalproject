      	The top government official overseeing the $1.5 trillion student loan market quit Monday after slamming Team Trump’s hostility toward protecting the millions of students burdened by crushing debt.
Seth Frotman will step down as student loan ombudsman at the end of the week, according to his resignation letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.
Frotman, on the job since 2016, was the latest high-level departure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since Mick Mulvaney, President Trump’s budget director who has been also acting director of the bureau, took over in late November.
Under Mulvaney, the bureau scaled back its enforcement work and proposed revising or rescinding all of the rules and regulations it put into place under the Obama administration to protect students.
Mulvaney downgraded the mission of Frotman’s student loan office and moved it under the umbrella of consumer education instead of enforcement.
“The damage you have done to the Bureau betrays these families and sacrifices the financial futures of millions of Americans in communities across the country,” Frotman said.
Congress specifically created the student loan ombudsman office when it created the CFPB.
Frotman was able to work with the bureau’s enforcement staff to specifically target bad behavior in the student loan market.
The office has returned $750 million to harmed student loan borrowers since its creation.
