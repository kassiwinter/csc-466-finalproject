                            	Linkedin/60 Minutes             	Frances Haugen has revealed herself as the Facebook whistleblower who provided private company research files to the Wall Street Journal.            Frances Haugen is a former Facebook employee who revealed herself as the whistleblower who provided private research documents to The Wall Street Journal for its Facebook Files project. Haugen was a product manager at Facebook until May 2021 and has worked for several major tech and social media companies during her 15-year career. Haugen revealed her identity during an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, October 3, 2021.The 37-year-old Haugen wrote on her website that in 2019 she, “was recruited to Facebook to be the lead Product Manager on the Civic Misinformation team which dealt with issues related to democracy, misinformation and she later also worked on counter-espionage.” Haugen added, “During her time at Facebook, Frances became increasingly alarmed by the choices the company makes prioritizing their own profits over public safety — putting people’s lives at risk. As a last resort and at great personal risk, Frances made the courageous act to blow the whistle on Facebook.”Haugen wrote on her website, “Frances fundamentally believes that the problems we are facing today with social media are solvable. We can have social media that brings out the best in humanity.” She told “60 Minutes,” “The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.”The Wall Street Journal says the Facebook Files project, “Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series, based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.”The newspaper, which began publishing articles based on the leaked research files in September, added, “Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company, up to the chief executive himself.”Facebook issued a written response to Haugen’s interview with “60 Minutes,” but its vice president of policy and global affairs, Nick Clegg, sent a memo to staff calling her statements and accusations misleading, and saying, “Social media has had a big impact on society in recent years, and Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out. But what evidence there is simply does not support the idea that Facebook, or social media more generally, is the primary cause of polarization,” according to The New York Times.In its written response, Facebook told “60 Minutes,” “Every day our teams have to balance protecting the right of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.”Here’s what you need to know about Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen:1.

— Frances Haugen (@FrancesHaugen_) October 4, 2021Tye added, “The Dodd-Frank Act, passed over ten years ago at this point, created an Office of the Whistleblower inside the SEC. And one of the provisions of that law says that no company can prohibit its employees from communicating with the SEC and sharing internal corporate documents with the SEC.”Another attorney for Haugen, Andrew Bakaj, also of “Whistleblower Aid,” told The Washington Post, “She’s a perfect example of why whistleblowers are so important: without her, we didn’t know what we didn’t know. It’s important because Big Tech is at an inflection point. It touches every aspect of our lives — whether it’s individuals personally or democratic institutions globally. With such far reaching consequences, transparency is critical to oversight, and lawful whistleblowing is a critical component of oversight and holding companies accountable.”READ NEXT: TikTok Star Shot & Killed Friend While Playing With Gun: Police
