DALLAS—Some 100 people are now being screened for potential exposure to Ebola in Texas, federal health officials said Thursday, as they seek to contain the first case of the disease diagnosed in the U.S.         Tom Frieden,    director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said so far they have identified a handful of individuals who may have come into contact with the patient, including members of his household. He said that systems are in place to contain the spread of Ebola in the U.S., but said that there will always be a risk of someone contracting the disease until the outbreak in Africa is controlled.

President         Barack Obama    on Thursday called Dallas Mayor         Mike Rawlings    to discuss the government's response to the Ebola case and ensure the city what it needs to contain the virus, the White House said Thursday.     "The president called to make sure the mayor was getting the resources he needed from the federal government, including the Centers for Disease Control, to treat the patient safely and control this case so that it does not spread widely," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.     Dr. Frieden and others on the call urged hospitals around the country to ask patients whether they have traveled to West Africa and to carefully evaluate that information as they make their diagnosis.      But Dr. Frieden said that banning travel to and from those countries would make it harder to send help there.      "The best way to protect ourselves is not to try to seal off these countries, but to provide the kind of services that are needed, so the disease is contained there," he said.      Texas health officials cautioned that the 100 figure represented a "very wide net," including "people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home" and that it was likely to drop as they narrowed the list to those actually at potential risk of infection, said         Carrie Williams,    a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services.     So far, the list of people potentially exposed to the disease has been rapidly growing. Earlier Thursday, Dallas County Health and Human Services put it at around 80, up from less than 20 the day before. The expansion comes as officials try to assess how far exposure to the disease may have rippled since a Liberian man,         Thomas Eric Duncan,    was diagnosed with the disease on Tuesday.      The list represents everyone who health authorities believe had any contact with the patient, however fleeting or brief, as well as individuals who subsequently had contact with those people.     Once health workers interview those people, they will winnow down the list to a number—likely much smaller—of those who they believe may have been exposed to Ebola.     People on the list are being notified by authorities and educated on the signs of Ebola. If they develop any symptoms, they have been told to seek medical treatment and report to health officials.                                                 Mr. Duncan is in an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.          Associated Press                                                                                                             "Everyone is on the lookout," said Erikka Neroes, a spokeswoman for Dallas County Health and Human Services. "We're just making sure that we keep tracking this again and again until we put this thing to rest."     The 12 to 18 people originally identified by health officials are being monitored by health-care workers, with their temperature being taken twice a day. Among those who had contact with Mr. Duncan, authorities previously said, are five children, ranging from elementary to high-school age, as well as a small group of adults.     Mr. Duncan currently is in an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Hospital officials said Thursday that Mr. Duncan's condition continues to be serious. Health officials said Mr. Duncan has access to a phone to communicate with others outside his unit.     Most of the people on the list haven't been ordered to stay home. However, health officials have formally ordered four of Mr. Duncan's close family members to stay home and not receive any visitors until at least Oct. 19. The family members could face criminal charges if they don't abide by the order.     Local officials said they issued the order late Wednesday because the family was noncompliant with a request to stay home. They said members of the family, who were examined Thursday, had not developed any symptoms. A law-enforcement official is stationed outside their apartment to make sure they don't leave.      Judge         Clay Jenkins,    the highest elected official in Dallas County, said there are no current plans to issue similar orders for other people. He said while he is concerned that people with symptoms might be reluctant to come forward for fear of being required to stay home, he's also worried the public will lose trust in authorities if they learn that Mr. Duncan's relatives are repeatedly leaving their home.     "It's a delicate balance and we recognize that," he said,           Local and state health officials said they had delivered groceries to the family and were arranging for a contractor to clean the apartment. Mr. Jenkins said it appeared that sealed bags filled with Mr. Duncan's belongings, including his clothes and sheets, were still inside, and that the family had pushed mattresses against the wall.     As health workers traced the people on the list, local leaders tried to assure the public that the risk of contagion is minimal.      Mayor Rawlings said the city has reached out to all the residents in the apartment complex where Mr. Duncan was staying to educate them about Ebola and deployed police officers to keep the peace there.      "We're getting the word out, and people are starting to understand what has happened," he said.     At the schools attended by the five children who came into contact with Mr. Duncan, custodians were doing extra cleaning, said         Mike Miles,    superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District. Still, attendance at those schools was down to 86% from 95% normally, said Mr. Miles.     To date, no one else has been diagnosed with Ebola in Texas. But Ms. Neroes, from the County health agency, said local health officials are preparing for the possibility that another person might come down with the illness.     "There are no other confirmed cases, but there could be," she said.     Write to Ana Campoy at ana.campoy@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
