New York Gov. Andrew CuomoAndrew CuomoWorking Families Party endorses primary challenger to New York Gov. Hochul Batya Ungar-Sargon, deputy opinion editor at Newsweek, says she believes Andrew Cuomo 'is poised for a comeback' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - States lifting mask mandates in schools MORE (D) is facing mounting scrutiny over his handling of COVID-19 nursing home deaths after revelations that a top aide said officials "froze" providing information about the deaths after questions from the Department of Justice (DOJ) last year.The remarks have set off a renewed firestorm over Cuomo's handling of the deaths and whether his administration sought to cover up details. They also undermine the star profile the governor developed on the national level at the start of the pandemic as he gave signature daily press conferences and sparred with then-President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves.

Andrew Gounardes (D). "There needs to be full accountability for what happened, and the legislature needs to reconsider its broad grant of emergency powers to the governor."State Sen. Jessica Ramos (D) asserted that Cuomo "allowed his ego and his donor base to dictate the response to this pandemic" while calling for him to be subpoenaed and lose his emergency powers."This news is another slap in the face to the many New Yorkers still grieving the loss of their loved ones across our state," she said in a statement.On a national level, congressional Republicans have been hammering Cuomo over the nursing home deaths for months, and increased their intensity after the latest revelations.All eight Republican members of Congress from New York on Friday released a joint statement calling for the Justice Department to open an investigation into Cuomo’s handling of the issue.“The mountain of evidence, lies, and criminal conduct cannot be ignored any longer,” Rep.

Regardless of our party affiliation, we should all be able to agree such an investigation is an essential step if we are going to achieve justice for the thousands of grieving New York families," he added.Cuomo had already taken a hit on the issue at the end of January, when New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) released a report finding that the state appeared to undercount nursing home deaths by approximately 50 percent.The state attorney general said that Cuomo's administration had not counted nursing home residents who had died of COVID-19 after being transferred to hospitals for treatment. James's report found that the total nursing home death toll was closer to 13,000 as opposed to the 8,600 reported by the state.The report also found that a Cuomo administration policy early in the pandemic to prevent nursing homes from turning away COVID-19 positive patients “may have contributed to increased risk of nursing home resident infection, and subsequent fatalities."Cuomo was at the White House on Friday to take part in a meeting with President BidenJoe BidenCory Booker and Rosario Dawson have reportedly split US ups estimate of Russian forces on Ukraine border to 130,000 Harris heads to Munich at pivotal moment MORE with other governors and mayors on coronavirus relief.Asked if Biden has confidence in Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic, White House press secretary Jen PsakiJen PsakiDemocratic Senate debates merits of passion vs. pragmatism White House uses GOP's own rhetoric to rebut Supreme Court criticisms Five obstacles Biden faces in battle against inflation MORE said that the meeting was “not to give anyone a stamp of approval” but instead to “discuss the urgency of passing the American Rescue Plan," Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal.New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioBill de BlasioNew York City to fire 3,000 unvaccinated employees on Friday DOJ to evaluate providing safe havens for drug use Adams defends dinner with Andrew Cuomo MORE (D) on Friday called for a “full accounting of what happened.”
