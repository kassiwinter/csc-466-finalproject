WARSAW—With a speech lauding Poland as a "defender of freedom,'' Mitt Romney finished a trip abroad Tuesday that was long on symbolism but short on new policy, a combination that may have given his presidential campaign much of what it wanted despite some well-publicized stumbles.The trip produced pictures of the presumptive Republican nominee meeting with political leaders in England, Israel and Poland as he tried to burnish his image as a potential commander in chief. He offered tough talk on Iran and appeared at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and with Polish icon Lech Walesa, images that could appeal to particular voter groups in the U.S.                                                 Mitt Romney at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Tuesday in Warsaw.          European Pressphoto Agency                                                                                                             But Mr. Romney's campaign was rattled after he offended local sensibilities in London by questioning the readiness to host the Olympics, and he angered Palestinians with comments about their economic difficulties.      "He has a tendency to speak his mind and to say what he believes," said Stuart Stevens, the campaign's chief strategist. "Whenever you do that, there will be those who disagree with you."          In his Tuesday speech, Mr. Romney praised the former communist country's growing economy and commitment to freedom—in contrast to Russia, where, he said, "once-promising advances toward a free and open society have faltered."           Earlier           "At a time of widespread economic slowdown and stagnation, your economy last year outperformed all the other nations of Europe," Mr. Romney said. He referenced President Ronald Reagan, a beloved figure by many here for his role in ending the Cold War, and Polish-born Pope John Paul II.     Mr. Romney's contrasts with the Obama administration were implicit, as he pointed out Poland's commitment to shrinking government spending and said other nations could learn from that example.     An outstanding question is whether the candidate's missteps sullied the effort to show voters that Mr. Romney can serve not just as an economic steward but as commander-in-chief.     "To the extent that people were paying any attention, it probably hurt, because the general portrayal of the trip was one of ineptitude," said Leslie Gelb, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. That said, "I've never seen an election where less attention was paid to foreign affairs."

Others said Mr. Romney successfully used the trip to reach important voting blocs at home, among them Jews, Catholics and Polish-Americans. "The nationwide picture of Romney at the 'wailing wall' sent a strong signal to evangelical Christians across the country and paid for the whole trip,'' said Scott Reed, a GOP strategist who managed former Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, referring to the site in Jerusalem.     Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said some voters "will like the fact that he was outspoken" during his trip abroad.

During the trip, the Obama administration took actions that in essence competed with the daily messages Mr. Romney aimed to convey. President Barack Obama signed legislation increasing ties with Israel and authorized the release of $70 million in military aid.      On Tuesday, the administration announced a pair of executive orders on Iran. One expands existing sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector to include petrochemicals and to make it even harder for Iran to sell oil; the other imposes sanctions on two banks, in China and in Iraq, that have conducted business with Iran. Both are meant to further stymie Iran's development of a nuclear weapon, Obama administration officials said.      Mr. Obama's campaign on Tuesday called Mr. Romney's trip "an embarrassing disaster."     "It's clear he was simply unable to represent America on the world stage," senior Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said during a call with reporters.

Mr. Romney attended the Olympics opening ceremony, where NBC's Bob Costas declared, "No matter your political position, you must acknowledge that he stepped in and did a very good job, in effect, saving the 2002 Winter Olympics." Some 40.7 million Americans watched the opening ceremony, NBC said.     In Israel, Mr. Romney's warning on Iran came as dusk crept upon Jerusalem's Old City in the background. In Poland he laid wreaths upon memorials and picked up the equivalent of an endorsement from Mr. Walesa, the former president and anti-Communist leader.     At least a dozen advance staffers shuttled around press and campaign donors, set up the speech sites and broadly ensured against visual disasters. They were on hand across three countries cordoning off seats for casino mogul and Romney donor Sheldon Adelson, conjuring up wireless hot spots for the traveling press and doling out bottles of water, power adapters and Romney For President gift bags.      Mr. Romney took only three questions from U.S. reporters in press availabilities (two were about the Olympics), a contrast with Mr. Obama's 2008 foreign trip, where the candidate responded to questions in every foreign country.     When a Romney foreign-policy adviser suggested in Israel that Mr. Romney would greenlight a unilateral strike against Iran by Israel, it took hours for the campaign to augment the remarks. And as Palestinians grew enraged by Mr. Romney's comments about their economic prosperity, in which he suggested culture was a factor, aides quietly seethed for hours as their campaign was called racist and ignorant before an adviser sought to clarify Mr. Romney's comments.     The tension came to a head Tuesday after Mr. Romney laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. After reporters shouted questions at the candidate as he walked across Pilsudski Square, traveling press secretary Rick Gorka told one of the reporters: "Shove it.''     "This is a holy site for the Polish people," Mr. Gorka said.      —Marcin Sobczyk, Keith Johnson and Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.
