                                                  Vice President Joe Biden addresses the NAACP annual convention, Thursday, July 12, 2012, in Houston.          Associated Press                                                                                                                                  Updated July 12, 2012 12:53 pm ET                 Vice President Joe Biden got a warm reception from the country's largest civil-rights organization Thursday as he attacked presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, whose remarks to the same group a day earlier drew loud boos.     "It's good to be home. It's good to be back," Mr. Biden said at the NAACP's annual convention in Houston, as he began an 25-minute speech in which he attacked Mr. Romney's ideas on everything from education to taxes. The vice president's comfort level was on display as he called out a names in the audience and reminded them he was a lifetime member.      Mr. Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, had faced a much tougher crowd on Wednesday. He was booed when he pledged to repeal President Barack Obama's health law and pledged that "If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him."      Mr. Biden sought to make clear otherwise, and attacked Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans on nearly every front.          On education, he said Mr. Obama sees it as central to the country's economic success, while for Mr. Romney it is "on the backburner."     On health care, Mr. Biden ticked off the popular benefits of the health-care law, such as that it prevents insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and allows children to stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26. He said Mr. Romney instead supports a health-care system "controlled by the insurance companies."     Romney adviser Tara Wall said in a statement: "The Black American community has struggled with high unemployment under President Obama, and Vice President Biden's speech today offered no new ideas or solutions. Mitt Romney will enact policies that lower taxes, encourage small-business hiring, reform our education system, and give all Americans an opportunity to pursue their dreams."     African American voters overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden in 2008, and they are expected to do so again this November. Mr. Obama didn't attend the convention himself but made a brief video where he said he was proud of the work he'd done with the NAACP, or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.     Mr. Biden also attacked Mr. Romney on how he would fill key positions. "Imagine what the Romney Justice Department would look like," he said, adding later, "imagine his recommendations for who is likely to be picked as attorney general or head of the civil-rights division."     Mr. Biden said, at the end of his remarks, that the election will "come down to character, conviction and vision and it will not surprise you I don't think it's even a close call."
