The Department of Justice will allow Congress to review highly classified requested documents relating to the FBI’s investigation into the Trump 2016 campaign in conjunction with the White House and other agencies, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday.“Based on the meeting with the President, the Department of Justice has asked the Inspector General to expand its current investigation to include any irregularities with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s or the Department of Justice’s tactics concerning the Trump Campaign,” Sanders said. “It was also agreed that White House Chief of Staff Kelly will immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with Congressional Leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested,” she continued. President Donald Trump met with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates, FBI Director Wray, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Monday afternoon to discuss congressional requests. Conservative lawmakers have pressed the DOJ for weeks to turn over highly classified documents relating to the FBI’s 2016 investigation, particularly to discern abuse of power or the use of a confidential informant to infiltrate the campaign.
