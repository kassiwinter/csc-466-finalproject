More than 100 Palestinians had died in retaliatory airstrikes before Thursday's escalation, including more than two dozen children.“Whoever attacks us will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu warned Monday while adding that the conflict could ”continue for some time.”“The terrorist organizations in Gaza crossed a red line and attacked us with missiles at the entrances to Jerusalem. Israel will respond with great force," the prime minister added. “We did not want to escalate, but those who chose to escalate will be hit forcefully."The Hill has reached out to the White House and the State Department for further comment.Updated: 9:25 p.m.                                               The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are © 1998 - 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
