There's a new dispute between President Obama and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.The Obama administration has accused Russia of violating a 1987 arms control treaty by testing a new ground-launched, long-range cruise missile.The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty bans American and Russian missiles that can travel from 300 to 3,400 miles, or to produce launchers of such missiles.Obama notified Putin of U.S. concerns in a letter delivered Monday.The New York Times, which broke the story, reports:"It is the most serious allegation of an arms control treaty violation that the Obama administration has leveled against Russia and adds another dispute to a relationship already burdened by tensions over the Kremlin's support for separatists in Ukraine and its decision to grant asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor ..."Russia first began testing the cruise missiles as early as 2008, according to American officials, and the Obama administration concluded by the end of 2011 that they were a compliance concern. In May 2013, Rose Gottemoeller, the State Department's senior arms control official, first raised the possibility of a violation with Russian officials."
