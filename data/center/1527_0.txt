Jobless claims rose for the second straight week, to 778,000, a sign the nationwide surge in virus cases was starting to weigh on the labor-market recovery. Claims haven’t risen for two consecutive weeks since July. Worker filings for unemployment insurance are down sharply from a peak of nearly seven million in late March. But they remain higher than in any previous recession—the pre-pandemic peak was 695,000 in 1982—for records tracing back to 1967.          Unemployment filings can be more volatile around the holidays, due to workweek changes that can cause seasonal-adjustment anomalies. The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly variation, increased by 5,000 to 748,500, the Labor Department said Wednesday.     Increases in jobless claims were widespread across states. Some of the states with sharp increases in virus cases, including Minnesota, Ohio and Illinois, saw a large rise in claims last week.          Other data released Wednesday showed the broader economic recovery continued in recent months. Orders of durable, or long-lasting goods, rose 1.3% in October. The Commerce Department said that its second reading of gross domestic product growth in the third quarter was unchanged from the initial estimate, at a 33.1% annual rate, or 7.4% over the prior quarter, while U.S. company earnings picked up strongly. Consumer spending rose 0.5%, the sixth straight monthly increase, the Commerce Department said.        
More on the Economy        A nationwide surge in Covid-19 cases threatens to weigh on the economic recovery, as many states and localities impose new restrictions on businesses, though less stringent than the ones introduced in the spring, economists say. Further, the spread of the virus, combined with the onset of winter, is likely to send more consumers indoors and hamper spending and employment in industries like restaurants.               “Covid is driving the bus on the economy, and we’re going to have some hairpin turns until we get to the nice, straight open road of the postvaccine world,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP.     The U.S. economy continues to recover, albeit more slowly than when many businesses first reopened from lockdowns in late spring and early summer. Growth in retail sales and employment has cooled in recent months, government data show. Consumers’ views toward the economic outlook soured at the beginning of November, according to the Conference Board, a private research group.                  “‘Covid is driving the bus on the economy, and we’re going to have some hairpin turns until we get to the nice, straight open road of the postvaccine world.’”                — Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG             Still, the labor market has rebounded faster than many economists projected. The unemployment rate, at 6.9%, is down from April’s post-World War II high of 14.7%. But recent real-time private-sector data point to a slowing job market. Growth in job postings has slowed across the U.S., according to job site ZipRecruiter. Small-business shutdowns and layoffs have increased in recent weeks, according to researchers at the University of Chicago, University of Illinois and University of California, Berkeley. They analyzed data for 40,000 small businesses that use Homebase, a scheduling-software company.          The number of people collecting unemployment benefits through regular state programs, which cover most workers, fell to 6.1 million for the week ended Nov. 14 from 6.4 million a week earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Labor Department. Continuing claims declined throughout the summer and into the fall, a sign many laid-off Americans returned to work.     However, some of the recent declines in continuing claims represent individuals who have exhausted the maximum duration of payments available through regular state programs, and are now collecting money through a federal program that provides an extra 13 weeks of benefits. About 4.5 million people were receiving aid through this extended-benefits program in the week ended Nov. 7—the largest number since the program began this spring, Labor Department data showed.     Both the extended-benefits program and a program that provides benefits to those not typically eligible for jobless aid—such as independent contractors and self-employed individuals—will expire at the end of this year.

Jason Rossman, 41 years old, of Watertown, Mass., has been collecting unemployment benefits since he was furloughed this spring from his project-management job in the trade-show industry. He said jobless benefits, particularly the extra $600 a week that ended this summer, have helped cushion his finances. Meanwhile, he is only spending money on essentials like food and utilities and has stopped dining out at restaurants.     Though he isn’t in dire financial straits, Mr. Rossman said he hopes to have a job by the time the federal extended-benefits program ends in December. He has been applying to project-management roles since his temporary layoff became permanent in early October. But he hasn’t landed one job interview yet and feels his background in the hard-hit events industry is limiting his career prospects right now.     “I’m very pessimistic that I’m going to actually find anything anytime soon,” Mr. Rossman said. He hopes that as vaccines start to become widely distributed and travel picks up, the trade-show industry will bounce back so he can return to his former job.          —Harriet Torry and Jeffrey Sparshott contributed to this article.
