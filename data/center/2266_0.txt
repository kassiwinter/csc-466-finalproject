HOLLYWOOD, Fla.—Donald Trump and his top aides have been trying privately to offer an olive branch to a GOP establishment that he has vilified. Many party insiders are wary of grasping it.Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to bridge that divide Friday with a double-edged message: The stop-Trump forces should lay down their weapons, and Mr. Trump should stop attacking the party. “Politics is a team sport, and we can’t win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee,” Mr. Priebus said in a speech at an RNC meeting here. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, the chairman noted that GOP presidential candidates should think of themselves as “trying out for our team.”     “No one is forcing them to wear our jersey. We expect our candidates to support our party and our eventual nominee,” he said.         More on Election 2016                The GOP’s longest-serving chairman was speaking to 168 of the party’s most established and influential regulars, many of whom are just beginning to accept that the billionaire businessman could well be their presidential nominee. Besides his repeated trashing of the RNC and its chairman this month, some of Mr. Trump’s policy stances and his incendiary rhetoric have rankled Republicans worried about his ability to win in November and his effect on down-ballot races.               Senior Trump aides, bolstered by the front-runner’s big win in this past week’s New York primary and his expected strong showings in other northeastern contests next week, traveled to the conference to mend fences, calm anxieties and make what one state party official called a “peace offering”—a promise to help raise money for the entire party and to work with the RNC.     But many party insiders are waiting for the candidate who is making conciliatory gestures in private to change his tune in public.     “They helped themselves a lot, but they will help themselves more when the candidate starts trying to unify Republicans from the stump more consistently,” said Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi, of Mr. Trump and his team. “He needs to do more if he wants to close this deal out.”     Juliana Bergeron, an RNC member from New Hampshire who isn’t committed to any candidate, said the three-day meeting here has helped calm some of her anxieties about a Trump nomination and the potential for tumult at the party convention this summer.     “It depends on the day, how I feel about Donald Trump,” she said. “People are going with him, but it’s a halfhearted approach.”     Still, some seemed to be warming to Mr. Trump out of sheer professional admiration for his huge win in New York this past week.     “This is 168 folks who love the inside baseball game,” said Steve DuPrey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. “The magnitude of the win in New York just before people came here started the buzz. People are impressed. The party will unite around whoever our winner is.”                                         Donald Trump, after an overwhelming victory in the New York Republican primary, unveiled a more establishment demeanor.

That is why the presidential candidates and their aides who came to the RNC meeting kept their focus on their strengths in the fall campaign.     Speaking to GOP officials when he visited the RNC meeting, Ohio Gov. John Kasich argued that polls showed he was better equipped to beat Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, than any other candidate. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas focused on what he thought his candidacy would do for other Republicans down ballot, and he warned that the party could lose control of the Senate and even the House if Mr. Trump were at the top of the ticket.     When Trump aides Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley met with RNC members Thursday evening, they tried to sell the New Yorker’s campaign in pragmatic, general election terms.     Mr. Wiley promised to “use the unique magic of Trump to get beyond a traditional voter base.” He suggested Mr. Trump would make the party competitive in states that its presidential nominees haven’t won in years, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.     The Trump team’s pitch at the RNC meeting is part of a behind-the-scenes effort to woo state party officials with assurances of fundraising and political help should he secure the nomination.     Mr. Manafort, in meetings with state GOP chairs, has said the Trump campaign and state party officials should begin planning now to raise money in state races in late May. The campaign has met so far with officials in states including Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Nevada and Indiana.          But Mr. Trump and his team still have a long way to go to heal the wounds inflicted by his bitter attacks on the party establishment. And some Republicans are anxious about what his nomination means for other GOP candidates.     Trump causes a lot of down-ballot uncertainty,” said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director of the House Republicans’ campaign arm. “It’s too soon to know exactly how problematic it will be at this point, but candidates in tough districts should be planning for the worst.”     Mr. Trump’s tirades against the delegate-selection process as “rigged” and “corrupt” has stung in states like Wyoming, which held a state party convention that, under procedures in place for decades, awarded almost all its delegates to Mr. Cruz.     “I’m in a tough spot,” said Wyoming GOP Chairman Matt Micheli. “I will do what is best for my state. We know what a Hillary Clinton administration would mean to Wyoming.”     In his speech, Mr. Priebus also made clear that the GOP shouldn’t bow to Trump supporters’ demand that he get the nomination even if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates needed to claim a majority and the nomination.     “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades,” Mr. Priebus said.     —Monica Langley and Patrick O’Connor contributed to this article.
