         WASHINGTON—President      Donald Trump        may not block critics from reading his         Twitter    feed, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday, finding that doing so violates their right to free speech.     Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York ruled that the president’s blocking of Twitter users from viewing his feed based on their political speech “constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.” She termed Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed, on which he issues tweets multiple times a day on a variety of issues, a “designated public forum.”      In July 2017, Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute filed a lawsuit alleging the president’s habit of blocking users who “disagreed with, criticized or mocked” him violated the free-speech protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.     The judge’s ruling named Mr. Trump and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, but she said it applied to public officials more broadly.               “This case requires us to consider whether a public official may, consistent with the First Amendment, ‘block’ a person from his Twitter account in response to the political views that person has expressed, and whether the analysis differs because that public official is the President of the United States,” Judge Buchwald wrote. “The answer to both questions is no.”                                         A majority of Americans surveyed in the most recent WSJ/NBC poll have a clear message for Donald Trump: stop tweeting.

While Mr. Trump typically tweets from his personal account, @realdonaldtrump, rather than his official account, @POTUS, Judge Buchwald ruled that the president presents the account as “being a presidential account…and, more importantly, uses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president.”     Judge Buchwald opted not to issue an injunction against Mr. Trump blocking Twitter users.     “A declaratory judgment should be sufficient, as no government official—including the president—is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared,” she wrote.     The White House didn’t immediately return a request for comment.     “We’re pleased with the court’s decision, which reflects a careful application of core First Amendment principles to government censorship on a new communications platform,” Jameel Jaffer, executive director for the Knight Institute, said in a statement. “The president’s practice of blocking critics on Twitter is pernicious and unconstitutional, and we hope this ruling will bring it to an end.”     Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
