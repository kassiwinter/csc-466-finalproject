Before the Kansas City Chiefs began their Super Bowl defense Thursday night against the Houston Texans in the first game of the 2020 NFL season, there was a question for both teams: How would they protest against racism in America?The answer was complicated. The Texans left the field entirely before both the national anthem and the playing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem. Their demonstration echoed a tense weekend in 2017, when several teams stayed in the locker room after President Trump used a speech to criticize players who kneel during the anthem. The Chiefs stayed on the field, where one player took a knee and raised a fist during the anthem. When the Texans returned to the field, both teams lined up and linked arms before the coin toss.     That demonstration kicked off a new era in the NFL, which is now embracing the right of player protest after a contentious period of years in which the league discouraged it, once tried to ban it and more broadly tried to root politics off the playing field.               But there are already signs that the players are rejecting aspects of the league’s efforts, as demonstrated by the Texans’ departure during the playing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”     And in a video released just before the season opener that called for “no more fluff and empty gestures,” Miami Dolphins players and coach Brian Flores said they would stay inside for both songs when they play Sunday.     The actions kicked off an NFL season that again has the potential for political tumult.     When sports returned during the pandemic, they were accompanied by strong public displays of support for the same cause that underpinned protests across the country throughout the spring and summer. After the killings of unarmed Black men and women such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, star athletes stepped up the pressure on their leagues to take action on issues such as police brutality, and used their platforms to bring heightened awareness.     This issue has been an especially thorny one in recent years for the NFL, which has reckoned with the controversy stemming from player protests during the national anthem ever since Colin Kaepernick launched the movement in 2016. When Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, took a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustices, he kickstarted a yearslong maelstrom for the country’s most popular sport.     The NFL became the center of a national political debate because of Kaepernick and the players who joined him. Some, including Mr. Trump, harshly criticized protesters who didn’t stand for the anthem. Others hailed the peaceful protest. During one weekend in 2017, with the controversy at a fever pitch, NFL players kneeled en masse in response to Trump’s rhetoric—with three teams opting not to take the field for the anthem.     This year’s nationwide protests over the issue that Kaepernick and others championed have led athletes—and their respective leagues—to use their popularity even more vigorously. At the NBA’s bubble in Orlando, players kneeled during the anthem and played on a court emblazoned with “Black Lives Matter,” while their uniforms were embroidered with messages of change. Later, the NBA experienced an unprecedented playoff work stoppage after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis.     Ahead of the season, the NFL shifted its messaging on these topics. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was wrong not to listen to its players earlier and came out in support of peaceful protest. “End Racism” and “It Takes All of Us” were painted into the end zones of Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., for the opening game.

Throughout the off-season, scores of players pledged to protest during the anthem. Coaches spoke about supporting their players no matter what they did. Owners who previously condemned the gesture have swung to now supporting kneeling.     The game’s matchup was particularly interesting because it featured two of the game’s best young quarterbacks. Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Houston’s Deshaun Watson are both Black and participated in a video over the summer that called out the league to admit it was wrong and more forcefully condemn racism.     This game could be a preview of the entire opening weekend—and season—when continued player protests are anticipated. It will also likely lead to the type of political blowback the NFL has become familiar with over the past several years, with those pressures surfacing during the heart of a presidential election campaign. Throughout the summer, Trump has continued to assail the player protests during the anthem on the field of play.     “Looking forward to live sports, but any time I witness a player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag, the game is over for me!” he tweeted July 21.
