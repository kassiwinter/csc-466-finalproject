WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court announced Friday that it would move quickly to decide whether the Trump administration can ask U.S. residents on the 2020 census whether they are citizens, a case infused with time pressures and immigration politics.The court’s announcement comes a month after a federal judge in Manhattan ruled Commerce Secretary         Wilbur Ross    committed “egregious” legal violations when he moved to add the citizenship question to the census. The justices will review that decision, adding another chapter to the court’s interaction with Trump administration initiatives affecting immigrants. A divided Supreme Court last June upheld a revised version of President Trump’s ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. But in December a split court rejected a request by the Trump administration to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern U.S. border illegally.         Around the U.S.                The New York ruling in the census case came after a full trial, and separate trial-court proceedings are taking place in California and Maryland. Normally, federal appeals courts would be the next to weigh in, but the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to bypass additional lower-court proceedings and intervene now because of looming deadlines that must to be met for the population count to begin on time.               The census questionnaire needs to be completed by June to be printed on schedule, according to the Justice Department. The final version also shapes a host of materials used to help Americans answer the query, including tools to put the form online in 12 non-English languages and smartphone software for census follow-up workers.     The justices said they will hear the case in late April.     Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has been recovering from cancer surgery, was back at the court Friday for the justices’ private conference in which they discussed the census case. Justice Ginsburg, the court’s eldest member and a leader of its liberal minority, had surgery in December to remove two cancerous growths on her left lung. She was absent from the Supreme Court’s public sessions last month and had been working from home.     The high court already has some familiarity with the case. The justices last year denied a Trump administration request to block the trial from going forward, though they did block plaintiffs from taking a deposition of Mr. Ross, in which he would have had to answer questions under oath.     The 10-year census is used to allocate more than $600 billion a year in government funding and reshapes the number of congressional seats states receive. A citizenship question hasn’t been asked on the decennial count since 1950 but is included in one-year surveys the census conducts on a smaller sample of the population.     Critics say the citizenship question is discriminatory and will dissuade Hispanics and other minorities from responding, especially at a time when the president is taking a hard line on immigration. The result will be an inaccurate population count that disadvantages immigrant-heavy areas around the nation, say groups of states, cities and immigrant advocates that have sued the administration.     When Mr. Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, last year announced the administration’s plans to add the citizenship question, he said the Justice Department needed the data to help enforce the Voting Rights Act.     The DOJ, which is defending the administration in court, said the citizenship question is lawful because the Constitution vests the government with discretion on how to conduct the census, and because the question was included during earlier eras of the nation’s history.     U.S. District Judge         Jesse Furman    in Manhattan last month ruled that, whatever Mr. Ross’s motivations for adding the citizenship question, the voting-rights explanation he offered publicly wasn’t the real reason.     The Commerce secretary offered shifting explanations and made inaccurate statements to the public and Congress that concealed the involvement of White House adviser         Steve Bannon    and others in the discussion, as well as Mr. Ross’s own interest from the beginning of his tenure in questioning people about their citizenship, the judge said.     Judge Furman found that Mr. Ross committed “a veritable smorgasbord” of violations of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, a law that generally requires government agencies to proceed in a reasonable and transparent manner when taking action. The judge found that adding the citizenship question would reduce response rates and result in less accurate data.     “In a startling number of ways, Secretary Ross’s explanations for his decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency,” the judge wrote.     Federal law bars the Census Bureau from sharing a respondent’s census answers with federal immigration authorities, but a survey of 50,000 households commissioned by the bureau last year found that the citizenship question could be a major barrier to getting people in the U.S. to answer the query. It found that 10% of respondents thought the purpose of the census was to locate people living in the country without documentation.     “The cloud of uncertainty that is hanging over the census as a result of the effort to add the citizenship question is already creating fear in immigrant communities,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a private consultant on census issues in Stamford, Conn. “It will be an uphill battle for stakeholders and the Census Bureau to convince people who are fearful to participate regardless of what the final decision is on including the question.”     Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Janet Adamy at janet.adamy@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
