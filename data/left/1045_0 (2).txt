It is even on our currency. Whatever route you take to get to Him is your choice. If you choose not to, that is also your choice. We will not give up our rights because you are offended. You offend me. If you don't like it too bad. Life is full of things we don't like. If you are going to pick a fight I can think of hundreds of things more worthy to eight about than against a message of peace and love. What is Really bothering you. Not being heard?

Or in private. unless you are going to include all religions then it seems presumptuous to assume everyone is a Christian. And the statement that this country was founded on Christianity is not true at all. Religious freedom means religious freedom.    	November 2, 2013 11:17 am at 11:17 am |
