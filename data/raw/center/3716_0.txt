Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein    in spring 2017 suggested secretly recording President Trump and recruiting cabinet members to remove him from office, former FBI Acting Director         Andrew McCabe    wrote in memos at the time, assertions that Mr. Rosenstein disputed on Friday. One person in the room when Mr. Rosenstein mentioned secret recordings said that he was clearly sarcastic and didn’t seriously consider it, according to an email from the person provided by the Justice Department on Friday. The New York Times first reported about the matter on Friday, citing people briefed about the events and about memos written by top Federal Bureau of Investigation officials, including Mr. McCabe. The existence of the McCabe memos was confirmed to The Wall Street Journal by a person familiar with them. Mr. Rosenstein called the Times report “inaccurate and factually incorrect.”      Around the time that Mr. Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey, Mr. Rosenstein told Mr. McCabe that he might be able to persuade top administration officials to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows cabinet members to deem the president incapable of performing his duties, the Times reported.               In a statement, Mr. Rosenstein said, “I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.”     The White House had no immediate comment.     At a rally Friday night in Springfield, Mo., Mr. Trump attacked the “bad ones” at the FBI and Justice Department, and claimed he had gotten rid of most of them. “There is a lingering stench, and we’re going to get rid of that, too,” he said, without naming anyone in particular.     Earlier in his tenure, Mr. Rosenstein had a rocky relationship with Mr. Trump, say people familiar with the matter. He was a regular target of Mr. Trump’s complaints about special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any possible collusion between Moscow and Mr. Trump’s campaign.     Mr. Trump, who denies any collusion, was warned by aides in April against firing Mr. Rosenstein, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel and oversees the Mueller probe.     Mr. Rosenstein led White House officials to believe last year that he would quit over what he viewed as the administration’s inaccurate depiction of his role in the firing of Mr. Comey, which led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller.     One former administration official said Mr. Rosenstein might have been in a state of “shock and disbelief” during his early exposure to Mr. Trump. This person said that it was evident from Mr. Rosenstein’s demeanor that he was bewildered by the tumultuous start to the new administration, and might have told Justice Department colleagues about his concerns.     But in recent months, the relationship between the two men has improved, people familiar with the matter say, as Mr. Rosenstein has regularly visited the White House and navigated sometimes-competing demands from the president and his own department. Mr. Trump last month described his rapport with Mr. Rosenstein as “fantastic.”     Despite the warmer relationship, Democrats have expressed concern that Mr. Trump would try to remove Mr. Rosenstein, given his role as the overseer of the Russia probe.     Mr. Rosenstein routinely briefs the president, including on aspects of the Russia investigation, and has largely tried to satisfy Mr. Trump’s congressional allies, who have demanded increasingly sensitive information about details of the probe.     A lawyer for Mr. McCabe, Michael Bromwich, said that Mr. McCabe, when he was deputy FBI director, had drafted memos to memorialize “significant discussions” with high-level officials, and had given all of them to Mr. Mueller. “He has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos,” Mr. Bromwich said.     Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Mr. McCabe in March, based on findings by the Justice Department’s inspector general that Mr. McCabe had misled investigators about his role in a Wall Street Journal article regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.     Mr. McCabe denied the allegations, which are also the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington.     —Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.
