            December 23rd, 2013   10:26 AM ET        	8 years agoCNN Political Unit  (CNN) - Apparently, Sen. Rand Paul is a fan of the famed sitcom "Seinfeld" and unsurprisingly, not a fan of Washington.
The Kentucky Republican took to Twitter on Monday to partake in "Festivus," a quirky holiday-esqe tradition popularized in a 1997 episode of the show that is “celebrated” on December 23 and calls for, among other things, the airing of grievances.
Paul sent a barrage of tweets, expressing discontent with politics inside the Beltway - from the Federal Reserve to the just-passed bipartisan budget - interspersed with an assortment of otherwise conventional complaints - including the food in the Senate cafeteria and the D.C. street cleaning schedule.
Here are some of the highlights:
First, Washington: In Washington, "bipartisan deal" is a synonym for "increasing our debt"

Speaking of bipartisanship:
To which Cory Booker replied: U, me & "feats of strength:" Senate floor, name the time MT @SenRandPaul A Festivus grievance re bipartisanship. Booker doesn't RT me enough

And the Senate: Allow more debate and amendments.  Don't change the rules to run it with an iron fist.
— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013 The Senate cafeteria never has burgoo.
— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013 Grievance with my otherwise wonderful staff: leave the turtleneck alone.  I like it and so do viewers.

D.C. parking: Minor grievance: I can never remember when to move my car for DC street cleaning.

And there's the Federal Reserve: Fed policies make you poorer, and hurt the poor and middle class the most. Ridiculous monetary policies increase the costs of goods.

"Seinfeld" writer Dan O’Keefe himself weighed in on Paul's reference the next day.
