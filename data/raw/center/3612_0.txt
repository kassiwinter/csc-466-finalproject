The violent Charlottesville, Va., rally last August energized the alt-right, and many in its ranks predicted their momentum would continue. But a year later, what is billed as a “white civil rights rally” across the street from the White House is expected to draw a smaller crowd, its organizer said.“It’s been a total fracturing of the right,” said         Jason Kessler,    who organized the Charlottesville gathering and is planning Sunday’s rally in Washington, D.C. Infighting, lawsuits and a social-media crackdown are hampering white nationalist and other right-wing groups, the groups’ leaders and people who track extremist groups say. Some white-supremacist groups have been blocked by financial companies that refuse to process credit-card transactions and mainstream social-media platforms like         Twitter    and         Facebook    that remove their posts, making it difficult to spread their message, find new recruits and raise funds.Many far-right groups and individuals have moved to lesser-known social-media and video-hosting platforms, with much less exposure to the general public.           The rally will have fewer attendees than the hundreds who showed up last year in Charlottesville, said Mr. Kessler, a 34-year-old white-nationalist organizer who lives in Charlottesville. The National Park Service approved the application for the rally but declined to discuss security measures, NPS spokesman         Mike Litterst    said.                A gathering by groups opposed to Mr. Kessler’s rally is planned in Washington the same day.      On Wednesday, Virginia Gov.         Ralph Northam    and the city of Charlottesville declared states of emergency for the coming weekend to “coordinate response to keep the peace,” according the governor’s office. State police and National Guard will patrol Charlottesville and parts of Northern Virginia during the weekend.      Large counterprotests by a broad coalition of people—from civil-rights groups to militant left-wing groups such as antifa—have overshadowed many planned alt-right demonstrations in the past year. Low attendance at far-right events in Boston, Tennessee, Florida and elsewhere disappointed organizers, and in at least one case—a rally scheduled in Murfreesboro, Tenn., in October—rally organizers never showed up.     Last August’s “Unite the Right” gathering in Charlottesville—one of the largest far-right events in years—started as an effort to stop the removal of a Confederate statue from a city park. Hundreds of marchers from various white nationalist, anti-federal-government and militia groups from around the nation joined together.     The groups and individuals at the rally held a range of extreme political views: Some called for a Nazi-style nation led by whites, some wanted to re-establish the Confederacy, and others called for gun rights and a strict interpretation of the Constitution that calls for limited government.                                         Scenes of the deadly violence that broke out between white nationalists and demonstrators protesting their rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017, including a car that plowed into a group of protesters.

Federal prosecutors charged a far-right sympathizer with a hate-crime act resulting in death and numerous other charges, and the man has pleaded not guilty.     An independent review of the violence found the Charlottesville police response was “inadequate and disconnected,” and the police chief has since left.     Individuals on both sides of the violence have been charged with crimes, and many far-right groups face a federal civil suit filed by people who witnessed the mayhem.              Chris Cantwell,    a white nationalist and internet radio show host who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault charges stemming from Charlottesville, said the alt.right movement is “a catastrophe” and “leaderless.”              Brian Levin,    director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said the “level of cooperation and giddiness” among far-right groups who gathered in Charlottesville has fallen because of lawsuits and widespread condemnation and opposition.     “The energy could not hold together,” Professor Levin said. “The movement is totally fragmented, far more than last year.”     The Detroit-based National Socialist Movement has been kicked off YouTube and Twitter, and credit-card companies won’t process its online transactions, which limits the group’s outreach and revenue, said leader         Jeff Schoep.    As of Aug. 2, the group’s legal-defense fund had raised $280 of its $40,000 goal, according to a link on the group’s website. Mr. Schoep said the group’s situation has been “a struggle.”     White nationalist group Identity Evropa, whose members attended the Charlottesville rally, has had three leaders in the last year. The organization didn’t respond to a request for comment, but current head         Patrick Casey    has said the group would no longer hold public events with other groups.     Another prominent group in Charlottesville, the Traditionalist Worker Party, disbanded. In March, leader         Matthew Heimbach    was arrested and charged with battery involving a domestic incident, according to a police report and court records. Mr. Heimbach, who pleaded not guilty, is scheduled for trial in September. His attorney didn’t return a call for comment.     An example of infighting within groups who attended last year’s rally involves Oath Keepers, an anti-federal-government, pro-Second Amendment militia group, and its leader,         Stewart Rhodes.    They have been sharply criticized on far-right social-media platforms for publicly denouncing racism after Charlottesville. The group didn’t respond to requests for comment.              Kathleen Blee,    a University of Pittsburgh sociologist who has written several books on racist groups and how they form, said far-right ideas continue to circulate and she expects a resurgence of such groups in the future. Such ideas can gain traction during times of political or economic crisis, she said.     But at the moment, she said, “Organizational strength is on the wane. It’s in steep decline.”     Corrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of a graphic on hate crimes accompanying this article incorrectly said data for San Francisco was for half of 2017.
