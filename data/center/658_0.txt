Reuters                                                                                                                                  Updated April 2, 2013 1:58 pm ET                 An NRA-backed task force on Tuesday laid out recommendations for improving school security, calling for a model training program that would allow some school personnel to carry firearms on campus.     Former Arkansas congressman Asa Hutchinson delivered to the National Rifle Association a 225-page report on school safety that includes assessments of best practices and gaps in security, as well as eight recommendations aimed at making schools safer. But as Mr. Hutchinson noted in a press conference Tuesday, the prescription that was likely to garner the most attention was the call for arming teachers and school staff who complete extensive training.      "Teachers should teach," Mr. Hutchinson said. But he added that school personnel who are trained and experienced with weapons should be permitted to carry guns.     After the December shooting massacre in Newtown, Conn., the NRA created the National School Shield program, tasking a group led by Mr. Hutchinson with developing a plan for improving school security. At the outset, the former congressman said gun control wasn't the answer and that more armed officers in schools would make them safer.          In recent weeks, Congress has been debating several gun-control measures, including legislation that would expand background checks and ban certain types of semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines.     The task force didn't address those issues, and Mr. Hutchinson said he was focused on school safety – not on the congressional debate about firearms. He declined to discuss those issues Tuesday, saying he would leave the questions about legislation to lawmakers.     The task force's recommendations drew sharp criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which said the proposals would do nothing to stop another gunman from doing harm.     "Today's NRA proposal is a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe," AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. "It is simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns and large magazine clips, which will simply lead to more violence."     Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son James was killed in the Newtown shootings, appeared at the press conference with Mr. Hutchinson. He praised the NRA's efforts, saying that goal should be to put politics aside and ensure that kids are safe.     Mr. Hutchinson said that every campus should have at least one armed school resource officer. He could not provide a price tag for accomplishing that objective, noting that salaries vary across the country.     Small and medium-size schools are less likely to have needed resources, according to the task force's report. And arming school personnel could help bolster security in districts that cannot afford more officers, Mr. Hutchinson said.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
