By Laura Meckler and Carol E. LeeAbove, video of Romney's remarks.Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney comes in for daily bashing from Democrats, but on Wednesday, he took heat from some Republicans as well. At issue was his sharp and fast criticism of President Barack Obama’s handling of deadly attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions. Mr. Romney said the Obama administration was wrong to condemn a U.S. film that ridicules Islam's Prophet Muhammad and that sparked the Middle East protests.           He pointed to an early statement by the U.S. embassy in Cairo, which was responding to the movie. In it, the embassy said it “condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.’’     That amounted to an apology for America and its values of freedom of speech, Mr. Romney said—first in a statement late Tuesday as the situation remained unclear--and again at a news conference on Wednesday.     “Apology for America's values is never the right course,” he said at the news conference in Jacksonville, Fla.     Most Republicans issued statements that steered clear of commenting on the administration’s handling of the attacks or Mr. Romney’s remarks. But some took the GOP presidential nominee to task.     “What the Americans people are looking for after 11 years of war in their presidential candidates is coolness and calmness and a steady hand, and political statements have the tendency to inflame situations as opposed to steadying them,” Steve Schmidt, who directed Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview. “His response is evaluated through the prism of his capacity to be commander in chief, not on the political sting he can land on the incumbent president.”      Mr. Schmidt, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said the Obama embassy statement calling for respect for other religions echoed comments from the Bush administration. In 2006, when the Muslim world erupted in anger over European cartoons ridiculing Muhammad, a Bush State Department spokesman said, “'We find them offensive, and we certainly understand why Muslims would find these images offensive.''      Mark Salter, a longtime adviser to Mr. McCain, wrote Wednesday that he has many problems with Obama foreign policy but that the Romney attack was off base – though as a 2008 McCain veteran he understood why the Romney campaign might feel pressure to step up its attacks on Mr. Obama. Mr. Salter also defended the original embassy statement.     “There is nothing wrong in principle with making clear to people, who have yet to embrace the categorical right to free speech, that Americans and their government deplore the deplorable, that we reject vile attacks on Muslims as vigorously as we reject vile anti-Semitic attacks,” he said. “To do so does not constitute sympathy for the people besieging our embassy, as Gov. Romney alleged. Nor is at an apology for America, as some Obama critics have claimed.”     Conservative writer David Frum wrote on Wednesday, “Politicians must pander, it goes with the job. But they mustn't leave their fingerprints all over their pandering. The Romney campaign's attempt to score political points on the killing of American diplomats was a dismal business in every respect.”     Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who writes a column for The Wall Street Journal’s opinion pages, said on Fox News that he had opened himself up to accusations that he was “trying to exploit things politically.”     “I belong to the old school of thinking in times of great drama and heightened crisis, and at times when something violent is happening to your people, I always think discretion is the better way to go,” she said. “I don’t feel that Mr. Romney has been doing himself any favors…. When hot things happen, cool words- or no words- is the way to go.”     Mr. Romney did get some backup.     “Governor Romney is absolutely right, there is no justification for these deadly attacks and we should never apologize for American freedom,” said Sen. Jim DeMint (R., S.C.). “It was disheartening to hear the administration condemn Americans engaging in free speech that hurt the feelings of Muslims, while real atrocities have been repeatedly committed by Islamic radicals against women, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East.”     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
