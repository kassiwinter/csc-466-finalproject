Molly Riley /UPI /Landov                  Here's a fresh headline that may be welcome to those who oppose the bipartisan plan to extend background checks of gun purchasers to sales made at gun shows and over the Internet:   But wait, if you support the plan from Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, there's this:  "Manchin-Toomey Bill Inching Closer To 60 Votes In Senate." (The Hill)  The best way to look at what will happen may be reflected in this passage from The Washington Post:  "Officially, only three Republican senators — Toomey, Collins and Mark Kirk (Ill.) — have said they plan to vote for the Manchin-Toomey agreement. Democratic aides say the bill will need the backing of at least six Republican senators to pass. The [broader gun] measure still has a long and tortuous path, with dozens of amendments expected. The Senate is scheduled to begin formal debate Tuesday by first considering the plan to expand the gun background-check program."   It all sound much like what we wrote one week ago: "Blocked Or Breaking Through? Mixed Signals On Gun Bills." That was followed by the Manchin-Toomey "break through."  According to The Associated Press, a vote on the Manchin-Toomey proposal could come as soon as Wednesday. Even with the uncertainty, it's seen as the most likely proposal to pass among a series of measures that include a proposed ban on assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.
