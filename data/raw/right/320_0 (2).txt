  President Biden on Friday will sign a sweeping new executive order aimed at cracking down on anti-competitive behavior by Big Tech and other sectors including labor, health care and financial services. Comprised of 72 actions and recommendations, the order is intended to promote competition in the U.S. economy by encouraging more than a dozen federal agencies to scrutinize corporate mergers and other ways that a growing number of companies build their outside market power, according to a White House fact sheet. The order is intended to "reduce the trend of corporate consolidation, increase competition, and deliver concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses," the White House said.BIG TECH FACES NEW ONSLAUGHT ON CAPITOL HILL It includes a broad range of goals and initiatives, such as: Urging the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to "challenge prior bad mergers" that past administrations let slidePushing the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements and occupational licensing requirements that the White House argues "impede economic mobility"Calling on the FTC to restore "net neutrality" laws that were unraveled by the Trump administrationAsking the FTC to establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of data by giant tech companiesEncouraging the FTC to prevent internet service providers from striking deal with landlords that limit tenants' choices, which the White House said can prevent broadband infrastructure expansion by new providersLowering prescription drug prices by supporting state and tribal efforts to import cheaper drugs from CanadaAllowing hearing aids to be sold over the counter at drug storesCreating a "White House Competition Council" to lead federal responses to large corporations’ growing economic power "Inadequate competition holds back economic growth and innovation," the White House fact sheet said, citing research from the Economic Innovation Group that found the rate of new business formation has plummeted by nearly 50% since the 1970s as large businesses make it difficult for Americans to break into the market.Stocks in this Article AMZN AMAZON.COM INC. $3,130.21 +26.87 (+0.87%) $2,732.17 +21.65 (+0.80%)FB META PLATFORMS INC.
