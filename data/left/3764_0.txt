So less than a month before Election Day, Trump traveled to southwest Iowa on Tuesday to try and bolster his and his party's fortunes there in November and beyond. He came to stump for Midwestern Republicans armed with a pledge to make good on a campaign promise poised to boost demand for corn grown by Iowa farmers worried recently about diminished trade with the huge Chinese market.During a rally in Council Bluffs, Trump formally announced that he is directing the Environmental Protection Agency to allow for the year-round sale of gasoline containing a high blend of corn-based ethanol. Currently, gas stations are not permitted to sell that fuel mixture during the peak summertime driving season."My administration is protecting ethanol," Trump told a crowd of supporters, many wearing green-and-yellow "Make Farmers Great Again" hats.Before Trump left on Air Force One, elected officials from Midwestern states gathered at the White House on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed on what one attendee, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), called afterward a "very good victory for agriculture." .@realDonaldTrump delivered for the #farmers today! Granting E15 year-round means that Iowans will see an increase in farm income, increased ethanol production and consumption and a boost in our economy. E15 also supports energy independence and consumer choice at the pump. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nODUp3ppPN— Joni Ernst (@SenJoniErnst) October 9, 2018
The ethanol industry, now able to check off an item long on their wish list, echoed that sentiment. "This is a big day for us," said Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. "This announcement is something we've been waiting on for really a few years now."Trump came to make his pitch for a series of Republican candidates running in tight races in Iowa. One of the Iowa Republicans whom Trump invited to speak on stage was Rep. David Young, who is in the midst of a tough reelection against Democrat Cindy Axne in Iowa's 3rd congressional district. The race is close, with the Cook Political Report rating it as a toss-up, since the district encompasses much of the Iowa Democratic Party's traditional stronghold of Des Moines, the state's biggest city. Also tight is the Iowa gubernatorial race, with incumbent Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds being edged out slightly by Democrat Fred Hubbell in recent polls. The state's next governor will play a role in shaping of Iowa's congressional districts after the 2020 Census.Trump tried to drive a wedge between Republicans and Democrats on the issue of supporting government requirements that call for a certain portion of the nation's gasoline supply to contain the corn-based fuel. "The Dems will end ethanol," Trump told Iowans on Tuesday. But the issue breaks down much more along geographic rather than partisan lines, with both Midwestern Republicans and Democrats supporting the ethanol mandates. “I’m pleased that the Administration is finally making good on its promise," Axne said in a statement, "but our farmers are still suffering from President Trump’s unnecessary tariffs."Indeed, with its many soybean, pork and corn producers, Iowa's farming sector is poised to be hit especially hard by retaliatory tariffs from China, Canada and elsewhere. GOP strategists are worried about the trade war initiated by Trump turning some farmers off to the party.Instead, the ethanol issue divides Congress between representatives from corn-growing states like Iowa and oil-producing states like Texas. The petroleum industry and its allies regard the renewable fuel standards as an unnecessary burden on refiners and argue gasoline containing more ethanol will wear down car engines more quickly."I’m concerned consumers will pay more over time because of wear and tear on their vehicles and I believe that increased use of ethanol can contribute to more pollution during the summer months," Rep. Gene Green (D-Tex.) said in a statement. That regional cleavage put Trump's former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoman, and Iowa's senators at loggerheads earlier this year after Pruitt proposed rewriting renewable-fuel rules. Grassley accused Pruitt of breaking Trump's promise during the 2016 GOP presidential primary to support ethanol.Now with Pruitt gone after a series of spending and managing problems and Andrew Wheeler installed as acting administrator, Grassley suggested the EPA is running more in line with Trump's campaign pledge. "We've got Wheeler at the head of the EPA. I think that's a big help," Grassley told reporters Tuesday. "Wheeler's approach has been much more satisfying to me than Pruitt."

Council would move Washington to 100-percent renewable energy by 2032, which would make it one of the nation’s most aggressive plans for reducing carbon emissions. Council member Mary M.
