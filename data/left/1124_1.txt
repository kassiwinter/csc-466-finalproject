WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's administration will continue to reject new applications for an immigration program that allows young, undocumented immigrants to live and work in the country but will let current "Dreamers" renew those protections. The decision, announced in a Department of Homeland Security memo, comes a month after a divided Supreme Court blocked the White House from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, finding the administration was "arbitrary and capricious" in how it sought to wind down the Obama-era program.Trump has long sought to roll back the DACA program, which allows some 650,000 immigrants brought to the country as children to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation. President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 through executive action and without congressional input.Since the June 18 Supreme Court decision, Trump has pledged to revisit the program – and has also promised sweeping changes to immigration he has indicated he would attempt through executive action. Trump faces reelection in November and has once again turned to immigration as a major campaign issue. Current DACA recipients would continue to be able to apply for one-year renewals of protections rather than the usual two-year intervals. No new initial requests for DACA will be accepted, according to DHS, while the administration reviews whether the DACA program should be "maintained, rescinded, or modified."Critics called the administration's review an attempt to limit the program, despite the Supreme Court's decision last month that the administration erred in striking it down in the first place. White House officials acknowledged Tuesday that they expected the move will ultimately face additional legal challenges. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said he is prepared to return to court immediately."The courts have spoken: DACA is in full effect, including for new applications," he said. "We are ready if the Trump Administration tries to block or dismantle DACA. We know what it takes to defend DACA – we've done it before and we'll do it again if necessary."More:Supreme Court ruling upholds DACA program for young immigrantsSome analysts took a more benign view, noting that the administration plans to respect current DACA recipients."On the face of it, this is good news for hundreds of thousands of individuals and their families," said Ali Noorani, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum."But, like with everything with the Trump administration, details matter," he added. "Furthermore, based on the Supreme Court’s ruling, there is no reason the administration should not be accepting new applications."Trump aides stressed that the high court did not find the decision to end the DACA program was illegal, only the way the administration sought to end it.Leah Litman, an assistant law professor at the University of Michigan, said it appeared that the administration was refusing to comply with the high court ruling."This policy also tries to implement the ruling in a way that would allow the admin to more quickly deport DACA recipients if Trump is re-elected and rescinds DACA again, this time successfully," she posted to Twitter.Bruce Lesley, president of the children's advocacy group First Focus on Children, noted that the Supreme Court's decision left considerable room for the Trump administration to undermine the program."It is up to Congress – morally and legislatively – to pass a permanent solution," Lesley said.
