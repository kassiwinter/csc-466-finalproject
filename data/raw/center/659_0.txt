                             Updated Nov. 26, 2012 10:38 am ET                      WASHINGTON—The White House warned in a new report that going off the so-called "fiscal cliff" could slow the growth of real gross domestic product by 1.4% and limit consumer spending during the holiday season.                                          Leaders tackling the fiscal cliff return to Washington Monday with the eyes of the world on them and seemingly only one point settled: that they've all pledged to try for an agreement.

The report comes as lawmakers are returning to Washington with just weeks left to find an agreement to prevent taxes from going up on millions and spending cuts from kicking in. It will likely provide fodder for both political parties as they seek to find a compromise.                The report says consumer confidence is at its highest point in five years and "The hard-earned rise in consumer confidence will be at risk if the middle-class tax cuts are not soon extended with a minimum of political drama."      While the report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the White House National Economic Council is new, it is well-known that going off the fiscal cliff could harm the economy and the holiday shopping season. Economists, business groups and chief executives have urged both sides to solve the issue quickly, and lawmakers have said they don't want to wait until the last minute.                The fiscal cliff is a combination of $500 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that begin in January.      The White House report doesn't suggest that going off the fiscal-cliff could push the U.S. back into a recession. And it doesn't include projections about how the tax increases and spending cuts would affect unemployment.      The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in early November said the tax increases and government-spending cuts would drive the U.S. economy back into recession next year and result in a jump in the jobless rate to 9.1% by the end of 2013.      The White House's warning comes just a few days after Black Friday and on Cyber Monday, vital shopping days for the retail industry and broader U.S. economy. Not averting the fiscal cliff would mean "risking one of the key contributors to growth and jobs in our economy at the most important time of the year for retail stores," the report said.      The White House estimates that if the tax increases go into effect consumers could spend $200 billion less next year than they would otherwise. That $200 billion, the White House said, is "approximately four times the total amount that 226 million shoppers spent on Black Friday weekend last year."      The report reiterates President         Barack Obama's    call on Congress to extend immediately tax cuts on income of up to $250,000. Mr. Obama wants tax cuts on income above that, which Republicans want extended, to be debated later.      "There is no reason to hold the middle-class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the highest income earners," the report says.      Mr. Obama and his aides will be huddling with lawmakers and their staff in coming weeks to try to solve the issue. Both sides have suggested they are willing to compromise but signs of a deal have yet to emerge.          Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
