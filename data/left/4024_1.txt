WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump took a swipe Monday at the potential presidential candidacy of businessman Howard Schultz, even as critics fear an independent bid by the former Starbucks CEO could help Trump in his re-election bid."Howard Schultz doesn’t have the 'guts' to run for President!" Trump tweeted, adding that he agreed with Schultz's self-deprecating assessment that he is not the smartest person in the world and would hire good advisers."America already has that!" Trump claimed. "I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!"Discussing his potential independent candidacy with CBS' "60 Minutes" on Sunday, Schultz – a longtime Democratic donor – said both the Democratic and Republican parties are failing the American people, and that Trump has proved he is wholly unqualified to be president.As for the comment about intelligence, Schultz, 65, said: "I have a long history of recognizing I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled."Political consultants from both parties praised Schultz's business background, but said an independent bid would likely split the anti-Trump vote with the Democratic nominee, giving the incumbent a better chance to win re-election.Republican consultant Mike Murphy, a Trump critic, tweeted of Schultz: "I admire the guy and think his intentions are completely honorable but if he runs his campaign slogan really should be, 'Schultz: The Independent Vote-Splitting Leadership Trump Needs Now' #WakeUpAndSmellTheCoffee."Democratic strategist Mark Mellman also urged the businessman not to make the race. "Mr Schultz the honest truth," he tweeted: "Despite your achievements, you have no chance of being elected POTUS running as an independent, but some real chance of throwing the general election to @realDonaldTrump. That can’t be your goal, but it could be your effect, if you pursue this course."Asked about the prospect of tipping the race to Trump, Schultz told "60 Minutes," "I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas."Schultz also told CBS said he anticipates tweeted attacks from Trump."I think, like most people .. I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets."2020:'Not a wise thing': Democrats pan Howard Schultz's potential bid
