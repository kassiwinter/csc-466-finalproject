BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama on Tuesday scored an upset win in a deeply Republican state, capturing the U.S. Senate seat here in a special election that drove a wedge within the Republican party and gave Democrats another burst of momentum ahead of the 2018 midterm races.The result was a defeat for President      Donald Trump,        who had endorsed Republican         Roy Moore,    and for his former White House strategist,         Steve Bannon,    who had made this the first major test of his strategy of supporting antiestablishment candidates to challenge the GOP old guard. It was also the second potent signal, after Democrats swept the Virginia legislature races a month ago, that Democratic enthusiasm in the 2018 midterms could produce the sort of election wave that could flip control of Congress.     Mr. Jones, a 63-year-old former federal prosecutor, won in part by appealing to voters who believed the allegations of sexual misconduct and assault on teenage girls when Mr. Moore was in his 30s were an embarrassment to the state and disqualifier for office.              More on the Alabama Senate Vote        “This entire race has been about dignity and respect,” Mr. Jones said at his boisterous victory rally in Birmingham. “This campaign has been about the rule of law. This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency.”               Mr. Jones pulled off his win due to high turnout by black Democratic voters and suburban Republicans who were put off by the Moore campaign travails. The sexual-misconduct allegations, which Mr. Moore denied, also seemed to create a drag for the Republican as turnout dipped in the largely white, rural counties that Republicans have counted on as a large part of their base.     The vote was close enough that Mr. Moore refused to concede, saying that there may be a recount required if, when the vote is certified, the margin of victory is less than one-half of one percentage point. With 99% of the vote tallied on Tuesday, Mr. Jones held a lead of 1.5%—well outside of the range of a mandatory recount.     “When the vote is this close, it is not over,” Mr. Moore said.     Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said on CNN that it was “highly unlikely” that the outcome would be overturned, but that the final vote count—including military ballots that hadn’t yet been counted wouldn’t be certified until after Dec. 26, but no later than Jan. 3.      Mr. Jones is the first Democrat that Alabamians have sent to the U.S. Senate in more than two decades. His pending arrival in the nation’s capital will trim the GOP’s Senate majority from 52-48 to 51-49, loosening the Republicans’ grip on power in the chamber after a year of struggling to give Mr. Trump’s agenda a legislative boost. The GOP attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed earlier this year by one vote because of defections within its own ranks.

They had needed a net gain of three seats to get to 51 seats, a target that had been hard for them to envision reaching. But after the Jones win, they only need a net gain of two seats, and there are two GOP seats ripe for flipping—in Arizona and Nevada.     The special election was held for the seat that was held by Jeff Sessions, the Republican who left the Senate to become Mr. Trump’s attorney general.                                          With the much-discussed race for a Senate seat in Alabama now behind us, the political world's attention turns to the 2018 midterm elections. WSJ's Gerald F.

Luther Strange.    Mr. Moore’s loss raises questions about the power of the president’s political coattails. Mr. Trump campaigned close to the Alabama border in Pensacola, Fla., last Friday and called on voters to back Mr. Moore to help push his agenda forward.     The president posted a tweet Tuesday night congratulating Mr. Jones on “a hard fought victory,” he said. “The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.”          Early Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump wrote he had predicted Mr. Moore’s defeat: “The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!”     Both camps were on edge throughout the night as the votes were being counted. Mr. Moore led for most of the night, but by a margin that narrowed steadily as more votes in major cities—Jones strongholds—were among the last to report their ballot counts.     One factor in the outcome was the significant number of ballots cast for write-in candidates, which likely hurt Mr. Moore because those votes were expected to come more from disaffected GOP voters than Democrats. The state’s senior GOP senator,         Richard Shelby,    led the way by announcing in advance of the election that he would cast a write-in ballot for an unnamed Republican because didn’t believe that Mr. Moore was fit to serve.     Coming amid a national debate over sexual harassment of women, the race was unusually competitive for a state as conservative as Alabama, where Republicans routinely win their races by landslide margins.          Mr. Jones’s own allies say he wouldn’t have had a chance to win if not for the allegations surrounding Mr. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice.     After the allegations surfaced, Mr. Jones’s campaign seized on the opportunity by upping its outreach to African-American voters and trying to woo white Republicans who never fully backed Mr. Moore. Many in the Alabama business community were concerned that a Moore victory would undermine efforts to attract new investments.     Mr. Jones campaigned as a low-key alternative to his opponent, whom he often cast as drama-laden and an embarrassment to Alabama. But he took heat from Mr. Moore and his allies over his stance supporting abortion rights, a significant issue in this bastion of religious conservatives.          Mr. Jones voted Tuesday morning at the Brookwood Baptist Church in Mountain Brook, Ala., about 50 miles away. Just before casting his ballot, he showed it to reporters and told them: “Not a secret.” Asked for his prediction after voting, he said: “We feel great.”     At the Jones campaign watch party on Tuesday night, the crowd seemed to grow more cheerful by the minute as early returns looked good for the Democrat. The Jones campaign had CNN on two big projectors in a hotel ballroom. As the network reported Mr. Jones pulling slightly ahead of Mr. Moore, the music stopped and the crowd roared on the news.      Mr. Moore ended his campaign Tuesday with characteristic flourish: He and his wife rode horseback to their polling place, a fire station in Gallant, Ala. The former judge was met by a thicket of reporters and television cameras. “The whole nation is watching,” he said.          Mr. Moore’s once-clear path to victory in this deeply conservative state became more complicated when the allegations surfaced. Mr. Moore declined calls from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP leaders to step aside in the race.          The Republican party was split over the campaign. Mr. McConnell and most other Senate Republicans opposed Mr. Moore, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee cut off fundraising agreements with him. So did the Republican National Committee, but it restored support after Mr. Trump belatedly endorsed Mr. Moore. Also in his corner: the Alabama Republican party and Mr. Bannon.     The allegations against Mr. Moore have been so widely broadcast that many Republicans worry he will be a burden on others running for re-election in 2018, much as their party’s Senate candidates in 2014 were affected by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin’s reference to “legitimate rape.” Mr. Akin lost to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.     “History demonstrates that it’s going to be a challenge for candidates with a Republican label because in every race people will be asked about things that were said by Mr. Moore,”         Sen. Jerry Moran    (R., Kan.), a former chairman of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. “It does have a political consequence which every member, both House and Senate, will potentially have to deal with.”     —Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
