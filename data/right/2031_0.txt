                                                  Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013                  Illustration:            Associated Press                                                                                                                                  Updated Oct. 23, 2015 7:15 am ET                 With a presidential run by Vice President Joe Biden taken off the table in the 2016 race for president, the White House on Thursday resumed its vigorous defense of Hillary Clinton.     White House spokesman Eric Schultz spoke glowingly at length about Mrs. Clinton when asked about her testimony before the House Committee on Benghazi.      "I was reminded of why President Obama chose Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state in the first place," Mr. Schultz said of his impressions while watching part of the hearing.     He added: "This is someone who clearly cares deeply about the issues; someone who has worked tirelessly to strengthen our relationships with our partners around the world; someone who cares deeply about our men and women who serve overseas in stations across the globe; and someone who when something goes wrong, takes responsibility and owns up to that mistake and is happy to answer questions on however many occasions because she is being held accountable."          That's quite an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, and it's far from the more measured rhetoric White House officials used publicly during Mr. Biden’s deliberations over whether to challenge her for the nomination.     The shift underscores how solidified the Democratic race is after Mr. Biden announced Wednesday he won't run, as well as the belief in the White House that Mrs. Clinton is the president's best hope for preserving his legacy.     When the vice president began seriously considering a presidential campaign this summer, the White House began saying from the podium that the Mr. Obama believes the best political decision he ever made was choosing Mr. Biden as his running mate. Questions about what that meant for the president's view of Mrs. Clinton, however, were dodged.     Mr. Biden was also weighing a presidential bid amid Mrs. Clinton's troubles over her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state, which the White House had increasingly struggled to defend. White House officials became sharper when asked about her email use during Mr. Biden's deliberations, and the effusive comments they had for her time in the Obama administration ebbed.     That appeared designed to give Mr. Biden the space to make a decision, and to position the White House as more balanced between the two if he were to run.     But now the White House is consolidating around the likely outcome that many there believed – and hoped for – despite Mr. Biden's considerations: Mrs. Clinton is headed for the Democratic nomination.
