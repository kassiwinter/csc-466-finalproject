Speaking at a vigil for the victims of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 on Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the downing of the airliner by an Iranian missile "a Canadian tragedy." Trudeau said he spoke with several victims' family members over the past few days and called their stories "gut-wrenching.""While no words can ease the pain, the grief, the outrage, it is my sincere hope that you can find some comfort in knowing that all Canadians stand with you," Trudeau said. "That is what makes us strong. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. This tragedy never should have occurred, and I want to assure you you have my full support during this extraordinarily difficult time.""I want to assure all families, and all Canadians, we will not rest until there are answers. We will not rest until there is justice and accountability," the prime minister concluded.                                         2:05 PM / January 12, 2020       Revolutionary Guard commander: "I wished I were in that plane"                             In a speech before Parliament, Hossein Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, apologized for the crash and said he has "never been so ashamed in my entire life," according to Iranian state television."We were at war with America and we still are," Salami said, according to remarks televised on Iranian state television. "We are soldiers of this nation and devotees of this people. I swear to almighty God that I wished I were in that plane and had crashed with them and had burned, but had not witnessed this tragic incident."Salami said the missile attack on bases in Iraq that house U.S. soldiers was not intended to kill people."The physical destruction was just because we wanted to say that we are so much more superior to the enemy [and] that we can hit any point we choose," Salami said.                                         1:39 PM / January 12, 2020       Protesters defy heavy police presence in Tehran                             Demonstrations continued for a second day in Tehran, despite a heavy police presence, with protesters calling for the ouster of senior officials, BBC News reported.

"This violates the Vienna Convention, which the regime has a notorious history of violating. We call on the regime to formally apologize to the UK for violating his rights and to respect the rights of all diplomats," State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus tweeted.The arrest occurred during protests in Tehran, according to BBC News. In a statement to BBC News, U.K. foreign secretary Dominic Raab said said "the arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law. The Iranian government is at a crossroads moment. It can continue its march toward pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards."                                         12:40 PM / January 11, 2020       Hundreds protest at universities in Tehran                             Hundreds gathered at universities in Tehran Saturday night to protest the government's late acknowledgement of the plane being shot down.

The airline's vice president called the decision "absolutely irresponsible." "When you act in war then you act however you wish. But there must be protection around ordinary people. If they are shooting somewhere from somewhere, they are obliged to close the airport," Ihor Sosnovskiy said at a news conference Saturday.Airline president Yevhen Dykhne said the Iranians gave no information of a possible threat prior to the plane's takeoff. –The Associated Press                                         7:59 AM / January 11, 2020       Ukrainian prime minister says Iran's admission is "an important step"                             Ukraine's prime minister said Iran's admission that it unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet near the Iranian capital isn't the end of investigating the catastrophe.

The military was at its "highest level of readiness," it said, amid the heightened tensions with the United States. "In such a condition, because of human error and in a unintentional way, the flight was hit," the statement said.

The group will be made up of representatives from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ukraine, Canada and Afghanistan.Champagne said that officials with the group's member nations will talk and share information on a daily basis in an effort to confirm the cause of the crash, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Company. Champagne also revised the number of Canadians on board, saying there were 57 Canadian citizens on board.

Earlier on Friday, an Iranian official said it could take "one or two years" to complete the investigation, Reuters reports. "The reason for the collapse of the Ukrainian passenger plane will be announced tomorrow after a meeting of the Air Accidents Commission, attended by both domestic and foreign parties involved in the incident," reads a translated tweet from Fars. Similar investigations in the United States are handled by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB typically releases a preliminary report in about a 7-10 day timeframe. A final report typically takes a year.Iranian officials leading the investigation into the crash have said they would allow representatives from the U.S., Canada, and France to join the crash assessment at a lab in Tehran. Ukrainian officials said they have been given access to the flight's black box.                                          1:41 PM / January 10, 2020       Ukraine gains access to black box                             Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said at a press conference on Friday in Kiev that Iran has fully cooperated with their investigation, and given them access to the plane's black box, the Agence France-Presse reports. The plane crashed early Wednesday morning near Tehran's airport, less than a week after the United States killed Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. Prystaiko also said that Ukrainian experts have been given access to the plane's fragments and the crash site. The debris from the crash had all but disappeared by Friday morning, when CBS News visited the site. "We're analyzing the pieces of the body of the plane… We are analyzing the chemical residues on the body of the plane," Prystaiko said. "We will come to our conclusions. We don't want to come to them right now.""We have so many different versions of what could happen to the plane that we will need some time to really understand and tell," he said. "We have not even started to reconstruct the black box information yet. This is the most vital piece of information."                                         12:16 PM / January 10, 2020       Sec. Pompeo says missile was likely Iranian                             Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a press conference on Friday that it is likely the Iranians are behind the plane that crashed early Wednesday morning soon after takeoff from Tehran's airport, killing all 176 people on board."We do believe that it is likely that the plane was shot down by an Iranian missile," Pompeo said. "We are going to let the investigation play out before we make a final determination. It's important that we get to the bottom of it."When asked what consequences Iran would face if it is determined they are behind the attack, Pompeo said he is in communication with his Canadian counterpart and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."They're working to get their resources on the ground to conduct that thorough investigation" he said. "... And when we get the results of that investigation, I am confident that we and the world will take appropriate actions in response."Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin added that the Treasury will issue sanction waivers to anyone helping to facilitate the crash investigation.                                         10:55 AM / January 10, 2020       NATO chief backs U.S., allies assessment of missile strike                             NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he had no reason to doubt reports from Western capitals suggesting an Iranian missile brought down a Ukrainian airliner, killing 176 people."I will not go into details about our intelligence but what I can say is we have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO allied capitals," Stoltenberg said.Canada and Britain have both said publicly that intelligence shows Iran shot down the plane outside Tehran, possibly mistakenly. U.S. officials have told CBS News that American intelligence shows the same, and video has emerged that appears to show two missiles streaking toward the plane, which then bursts into flames.Iran has vehemently denied that it shot down the jetliner.- CBS/AFP                                         10:06 AM / January 10, 2020       Iran says "certain" no missile hit Ukrainian jet                             Iran's civil aviation chief on Friday said he was "certain" that no missile had struck the Ukrainian passenger jet that burst into flames and crashed down outside Tehran earlier this week. Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's national Civil Aviation Authority, rejected U.S. and Canadian intelligence showing a pair of Iranian surface-to-air missiles likely brought the plane down just hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at military bases home to American troops in Iraq. "The causes we aren't sure of yet, but as I said, that which we can say for certain is that a missile did not strike the plane," Abedzadeh insisted. He said that moments after noting that "any remarks made before the data is extracted (from the plane's black boxes) is not an expert opinion." Iranian officials said earlier that the country's experts were working to extract and analyze data from the Boeing 737-800's flight data and cockpit voice recorders at a "suitable laboratory" at a Tehran airport. They said that if they required help in doing so, they would seek it from Ukraine or France.Asked about videos that appear to show missiles streaking toward the jet before it bursts into flames, Abedzadeh said "some videos have been circulating that support what we confirm, that the plane was on fire for 60 to 70 seconds… But videos that it was hit by something cannot be scientifically correct. That a plane could be struck by an object and continue to fly for 60-70 seconds, this is not possible."He also claimed the debris field — which had all but disappeared by Friday morning, according to a CBS News team that visited the site — would have been much wider had there been an explosion in the air. CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer said it was a large crash site, but they were only permitted to view part of it.                                         9:35 AM / January 10, 2020       Ukraine thanks U.S. for "information" to assist crash probe                             Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that "information obtained from the U.S." would help with the investigation into the crash of a Ukrainian jetliner in Iran earlier this week. Iran has denied intelligence gathered by both U.S. and Canadian officials suggesting at least one Iranian surface-to-air missile brought down the plane minutes after it took off from Tehran early Wednesday morning. Iran is leading the investigation, but has said Ukrainian and French officials would be involved in the probe. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reported Friday, however, that two days after the crash, virtually all the debris had been cleared and Ukrainian officials had not yet visited the crash site.In a tweet after a phone conversation with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Zelensky thanked the United States for "the condolences of the American people & valuable support of the U.S. in investigating the causes of the plane crash."                                         8:03 AM / January 10, 2020       Pompeo says "we'll have to see" if something "insidious" downed plane                             Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded Friday morning to Iran's flat denial of intelligence suggesting it mistakenly shot down a civilian passenger jet by accepting that it was "possible it's a mechanical failure."But Pompeo told Fox News, "we'll have to see if, in fact, it's the case that there was something more insidious than this."Officials have said U.S. and Canadian intelligence shows a pair of Iranian surface-to-air missiles were fired from the Tehran area early Wednesday morning — just hours after Iran launched about 15 ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops — which likely brought down the Ukrainian International Airlines jet, killing everyone on board.                                         7:34 AM / January 10, 2020       Video shows apparent missile strike                             There were mounting indications Friday morning that Iran shot down the civilian passenger jet in its own airspace, killing many of its own citizens early Wednesday morning.

In it you can see a bright flash, which sources tell CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer was likely the explosion of two surface-to-air missiles. Surveillance cameras picked up a shower of debris from the Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 that crashed just minutes after takeoff from Tehran's main airport, killing 176 people. Palmer visited the crash site Friday morning and said there was barely any debris from the plane left, no security cordon around the site as Iran announced it was beginning its investigation with assistance from foreign partners, chiefly Ukraine and France. Watch the video above to see Palmer's full report from Tehran.                                          6:52 AM / January 10, 2020       Iran says black boxes being assessed at "suitable laboratory"                             Iran's state-run media said Friday that representatives from the U.S., Canada and France were on their way to the Islamic Republic to join Iranian investigators leading the investigation into the crash of the Ukrainian jet that American officials say Iran likely shot down by mistake. Iran has made clear that its own investigators will lead the probe, and said the black boxes were already being assessed at a lab in Tehran.Hassan Rezaiefar of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization was quoted by various Iranian outlets as saying the country's investigators and experts from several domestic airlines were assessing the black boxes at a "suitable laboratory at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport" to see if they could reliably analyze the information from them "inside the country."IRNA said if the Iranians were unable to successfully extract the data, "with the aim of preventing damage to information," they would seek help from Russia, France, Canada or Ukraine.                                         5:16 AM / January 10, 2020       Iran accuses U.S. of "spreading lies" about crash                             A spokesman and adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has accused the U.S. government of "spreading lies" about the crash of a Ukrainian airliner this week, saying Washington should wait for the results of the ongoing investigation. Ali Rabiei also offered condolences to the families of the doomed Ukrainian International Airlines plane that came down near Tehran in his statement issued late Thursday, according to Iran's state-run news agency Tasnim. U.S. officials have told CBS News that intelligence shows an Iranian surface-to-air missile struck the Boeing 737-800 minutes after it took off from Tehran, likely by mistake.The "Civil Aviation Organization of Islamic Republic of Iran has now set up a committee to probe the incident in accordance with ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) regulations," Rabai said, insisting that the committee, including experts from all countries involved in the plane crash, would transparently investigate the accident and announce the results. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board confirmed an invite from Iran, but said it was unclear how much of a role it would be able to play given U.S. sanctions on Iran.                                         4:19 AM / January 10, 2020       CBS News sees crash site scrubbed of debris                             CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer was able Friday to briefly view the site in Tehran where the Ukrainian plane crashed two days earlier, before Iranian security officials compelled her team to leave. She said very little debris was left from the early Wednesday morning crash and there were people — not officials but apparent scavengers — poring over the scene looking for pieces to take away.         CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from the site where a Ukrainian passenger jet crashed down in flames in Tehran, Iran, on January 10, 2020, two days after the crash.                           CBS                   Ukrainian investigators had not yet visited the site as of noon on Friday (3:30 a.m. Eastern). Witnesses told Palmer they saw a truck and heavy equipment come on Thursday and take away most of the wreckage. Iran has not said where the wreckage was taken. Palmer and her team said the crash site was large and they were only able to view one part of it, but after they visited the scene a witness told them larger pieces of the jet's fuselage and nose had been removed. The witness said removal of both the wreckage and bodies of the victims began the day of the crash. See Palmer's full report from Tehran on "CBS This Morning" at 7 a.m. Eastern.                                         3:57 AM / January 10, 2020       Russia calls missile claims "groundless"                             Russian lawmakers said Friday that claims of a missile hitting a Ukrainian jetliner over Iran were "groundless" and they accused the West of prematurely assigning blame to Tehran. Vladimir Dzhabarov, a lawmaker in Russia's upper house of parliament, said Friday that "we need to be cautious with conclusions. Iranians have invited Ukraine to take part in the investigation. Why would they do it if they knew they had shot (the plane) down?" Leonid Slutsky, a lawmaker with Russia's lower house of parliament, echoed that sentiment and said conclusions about the cause of the crash could be politically motivated. "Facts and solid evidence are needed, rather than vague references to intelligence findings. So far it has all been groundless," Slutsky said. - Associated Press                                         3:29 AM / January 10, 2020       Ukrainian leader: "Missile theory" not "confirmed yet"                             The Ukrainian president says he is not ruling out the possibility that the plane which crashed earlier this week in Iran had been hit a by a missile."The missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet," Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Facebook post Friday. All 176 people on board the plane bound for Ukraine died.Zelensky reiterated his call for "all international partners" - the U.S., Britain and Canada in particular - to share data and evidence relevant to the crash.

"Close interagency coordination is of particular importance in this instance given the long-standing sanctions against Iran, which, among other things, prohibit the provision of technical data, lending of technical assistance and travel to Iran," the NTSB said. Iran's U.N.

A spokesman for the armed forces called the allegations ridiculous and Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the Iranian Civilian Aviation Authority, said it's not scientifically possible.Within hours of the crash, the aviation authority pointed toward technical failure as the cause and said the plane was on fire as it tried to return to the airport minutes after takeoff. A website affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard called the U.S. intelligence a conspiracy cooked up by Iran's enemies. Ukrainian investigators arrived at the crash site to participate but they have not yet been given access to the crash site.The Iranians have said that they will not hand over the plane's black boxes, but will work with the Ukrainians to download and analyze the data. They said if they need extra help, they may approach other countries and specifically mentioned France.                                         7:29 PM / January 9, 2020       Canada officials will visit crash site in Iran                    The Transportation Safety Board of Canada announced Thursday that it has been invited by Iran to visit the site of the plane crash.
