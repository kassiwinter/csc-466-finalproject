                                                                                                                                         AUSTIN, Texas — Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry says a disparaging tweet from his personal account about the Democratic district attorney he’s charged with unlawfully trying to oust was unauthorized.                                                                                                                                                      A tweet from Perry’s account Sunday, after the other post was deleted, said he does “not condone the tweet.” The tweets were sent from Perry’s verified account, but it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed. Perry aides did not immediately return messages.                                                                                                                                                      The earlier tweet linked to an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April.                                                                                                                                                         Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury indictment. Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the abuse of power charges a political ploy.
