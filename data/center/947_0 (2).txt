                             Aug. 29, 2013 10:57 am ET                      WASHINGTON—In an effort to curtail gun violence, the         Obama    administration on Thursday said it would close two gun-sale loopholes by limiting imports of military weapons and requiring background checks when machine guns, short-barreled shotguns and other high-capacity guns are acquired by a trust or a corporation.      The new steps build on 23 executive actions President Barack Obama has announced to reduce gun violence following the mass shooting last year at an elementary school in Connecticut. The president's piecemeal approach to keeping guns off the streets is in response to Congress failing to pass legislation to expand background checks and limit high-capacity gun magazines.      The limit on importing military firearms that the U.S. sold or provided to allies abroad contains a few exceptions, such as allowing the weapons to be placed in museums. Since 2005, the White House said, the U.S. has authorized 250,000 re-imports of military firearms.     Gun-rights groups and some legal experts say the new steps will do little to reduce crime because the majority of shootings involve handguns, not the military-grade firearms or automatic machine guns targeted by the latest administration action. Most of those guns, they said, are purchased by gun collectors and kept in their family.                "It seems like such an esoteric thing to go after," said Erich Pratt, a spokesman for the gun-rights group Gun Owners of America. He said people request to transfer the weapons to a trust or corporation so they can keep the firearms in their family.      The White House said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which oversees much of the country's gun purchases, received more than 39,000 requests last year to transfer machine guns and short-barreled shotguns to trusts or corporations.     The president's earlier actions include steps to fill gaps in the background-check system and allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes and prevention of gun violence. The White House has also urged Congress to confirm a permanent director at ATF.      Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of the 2011 book "Gunfight," said the steps would do little to reduce gun violence but show the president is not giving up. "I think the president is doing the best he can with limited tools. If we take all of his executive actions, will they have a major impact on gun crime? No," he said.      At the swearing-in ceremony of ATF Director Todd Jones on Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden vowed to continue pushing Congress to act to reduce gun violence. "If Congress doesn't act, we'll fight for a new Congress. It's that simple," he said. "But we're going to get this done."     Write to         Jared A.
