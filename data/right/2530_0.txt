           Florida's early turnout could be good news to both Democrats and Republicans, as almost 5.3 million cast their ballots before Election Day.
According to CBS News, 41 percent of active registered voters in the state have submitted their ballots, just under 5.3 million so far, up from 4.8 million in 2012.
So far less than 2,000 votes separate the two major parties, while almost 1 million unaffiliated voters have cast a ballot as well.
As of 5 a.m. this morning, 4.9 million votes had been cast according to Politico. "The Republican Party of Florida is very pleased with the numbers we are seeing so far," state party chairman Blaise Ingoglia told The Tampa Bay Times in an email late Thursday.
"While we expect to continue to have the lead, the reality is, all we have to do is keep it close going into Election Day."
Four years ago, Democrats held a slim margin over Republicans, 101,000 votes of 3.2 million. President Barack Obama won the state by less than 1 percent.
Obama's 2008 Florida campaign director Steve Schale told Obama recently that Clinton would win the state based on early voting, the state's voter diversity, and the high number of women voters.
"I told him, 'It's not like she's going to win by a ton, but it's trending in a place where she wins,'" he told the Times. Schale predicts Clinton will beat Donald Trump by only 1 or 2 percentage points, and added that Democrats trailing Republicans in total votes cast so far can be an advantage: "I don't mind being down. Being down is a huge motivator."           Â© 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
