WASHINGTON—The Secret Service came under withering criticism on Tuesday over the recent White House security breach and amid new revelations that an armed felon rode an elevator with President         Barack Obama    days earlier.Fresh details of the Sept. 19 intrusion, aired at a House Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday, revealed numerous security lapses that allowed Omar J. Gonzalez to get farther into the White House than previously known after he had scaled a fence and darted across the lawn. Mr. Gonzalez knocked over a Secret Service officer and hopscotched through the first floor of the executive mansion before finally being tackled and handcuffed just outside the Green Room. He even briefly set foot in the East Room, where the president holds news conferences and entertains on formal occasions, just off a stairway that leads to the first family’s residence.           More           The whirlwind trip through the White House was aided by two open front doors that couldn’t be automatically locked, an alarm system muted in order to avoid disturbing those in the executive mansion and a decision by Secret Service officers to subdue the intruder, rather than fire shots or release guard dogs.               On Tuesday, Mr. Gonzalez was indicted by a federal grand jury on three criminal counts, including unlawfully entering a restricted building while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. He is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court on Wednesday.     Mr. Gonzalez’s lawyer declined to comment on the case.      Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, under often testy questioning by lawmakers, said that at 7:20 p.m. on that Friday, Mr. Gonzalez darted up the steps to the North Portico entrance, “knocked back” an officer standing in the doorway and barged into the Entrance Hall, where he was chased by the agent as he made his way deeper into the building. Mr. Gonzalez and the agent stepped “momentarily” into the East Room until a second officer arrived, and Mr. Gonzalez was taken down and handcuffed just outside the Green Room, she said.                                                                                                                                                     “Eight hundred million dollars a year…during your tenure…and that door was unlocked,” said Rep.         Darrell Issa    (R., Calif.), referring to the Secret Service’s personnel budget.     “The door was unlocked at the time of Mr. Gonzalez’s entry, that’s correct,” Ms. Pierson said, adding that automatic locks have since been installed on the White House front doors.     “The fence failed, officers chased him, didn’t catch him, sniper was in position, no shots were fired, dogs were out there, weren’t released, countersurveillance, I’m understanding, is understaffed…nobody shot anything,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) said.     “It’s clear that our security plan was not properly executed,” Ms. Pierson said. “This is unacceptable and I take full responsibility. And I will make sure that it does not happen again.”      Her explanations left many on Capitol Hill unsatisfied and fueled concerns among some that the White House may be vulnerable to future attacks. It comes as Mr. Chaffetz said on Tuesday that he was informed that Mr. Obama rode on an elevator with an armed private security guard with felony convictions during a Sept. 16 trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Mr. Obama visited the centers to discuss the U.S. response to the Ebola crisis. (A law firm representing the guard said in November that its client isn’t a convicted felon.)     The incident was reported earlier by the Washington Examiner.     “This person was within arm’s length of the president with a gun. He has three felony convictions for assault and battery is my understanding. He was never given a background check. He was not badged by the Secret Service,” Mr. Chaffetz said.     The Secret Service is looking at whether its procedures were followed, including if the guard was properly vetted and if he fell into the category of law-enforcement officers who are generally allowed to carry weapons around the president, an official said.     Mr. Chaffetz obliquely questioned Ms. Pierson about the incident during Tuesday’s hearing, asking if she had briefed the president on any other breaches of his security so far this year. She said she had not.      “My worry is the would-be terrorists, they’ve seen this. They know there’s a vulnerability and I worry that they’re going to exploit it,” Mr. Chaffetz said to reporters after the hearing. “The more I learn, the less confidence I have” in the Secret Service, he said.     Lawmakers during the hearing seemed almost as concerned with the Secret Service’s initial depiction of the Sept. 19 intrusion, repeatedly asking Ms. Pierson why the agency first said Mr. Gonzalez was unarmed and suggested he had been apprehended just inside the front doors. Ms. Pierson did little to clarify the initial response, saying only “there has been a lot of information in this case, and that’s why…we are doing a robust review.”     White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that in the midst of a chaotic incident, it isn’t surprising for conflicting pieces of information to emerge. “One priority is to disseminate the information quickly; the other priority is to ensure that the information has been thoroughly vetted and verified and that the facts are locked down,” he said.     He declined to say when, exactly, Mr. Obama learned Mr. Gonzalez, a U.S. Army veteran who served two tours in Iraq, had gotten as far as the East Room, where just four days earlier Mr. Obama had awarded the Medal of Honor to two members of the Army. Mr. Obama and his family had left the White House for Camp David when the intrusion occurred.     Mr. Obama was briefed by senior members of his team immediately after the incident, and he met last Thursday with Ms. Pierson.                                         Lawmakers chastised Secret Service director Julia Pierson over the Sept. 19 breach when an intruder got deep inside the White House. WSJ’s Reid Epstein and Tanya Rivero discuss.

Ms. Pierson was brought in early last year in part to restore the agency’s reputation. At the time, some raised questions about whether the 30-year agency veteran was properly qualified given much of her time was in administrative roles, not protection.     In her first year and a half on the job, Ms. Pierson has focused on strengthening the Secret Service’s disciplinary procedures—something she highlighted before the House panel Tuesday. She has created an Office of Integrity and revised the agency’s misconduct policies. Ms. Pierson also said she has expanded the agency’s training and sought to fill gaps in leadership.     Current and former Secret Service officials have said the agency has been forced to reduce personnel because of funding shortfalls, hurting its ability to operate. From 2008 to 2011, 35 classes of new recruits for the Uniformed Division, which guards the White House grounds, went through training. In the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, only two did.                                                 ‘The door was unlocked at the time of Mr. Gonzalez’s entry,’ said Secret Service Director Julia Pierson.

The far smaller number of people devoted to the agency’s field offices, meanwhile, has risen by 5% over the same period.     While lawmakers uniformly expressed concern over how the Secret Service responded to the fence jumping, some voiced trepidation about having the agency embrace a maximum-force mentality anytime someone breaches the White House grounds.     A shootout on the White House lawn should be a last resort, said Rep. Gerald Connolly (D., Va.).     Ms. Pierson said she believed officers used “restraint” and made a “difficult decision” to subdue Mr. Gonzalez.     The ambiguity of the situation likely contributed to the confusion, one person familiar with the agency’s procedures said. A more obviously armed person or group coming over the fence would likely have sparked a much stronger response, including the deployment of teams trained to fight off armed attackers, the person said.     —Andrew Grossman and Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.
