WASHINGTON—The Obama administration outlined a new compromise Friday aimed at shielding religious business owners and Christian universities and charities from the health law's contraception-coverage requirements, but a chilly initial response from Roman Catholic bishops suggested the move wouldn't assuage their concerns.Federal officials laid out fresh rules to create a multistep process in which employers opposed to including birth control in workers' insurance would state their objections in writing, and the federal government would take over responsibility for the coverage from there to ensure that employees can still obtain contraception without making copayments, as part of the law.

Previously           The revised arrangements come in response to a Supreme Court decision in late June that the administration couldn't impose the requirements on the owners of for-profit companies such as arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby, who had argued that as evangelical Christians, they objected to covering the so-called morning-after pill and certain intrauterine devices because they consider them tantamount to abortion.     In a 5-4 ruling, the court found the government hadn't done enough to take into account the rights of owners of closely held businesses under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which requires federal officials to accommodate such beliefs unless they have no other way of carrying out a particular policy.               Days after that decision, a majority of the court's justices indicated that a previous compromise offered by the administration specifically for religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations also might not withstand dozens of separate lawsuits brought by high-profile plaintiffs, such as the University of Notre Dame.     On Friday, Catholic bishops, who have led a campaign against the contraception-coverage provision that has included numerous legal challenges since its announcement in August 2011, indicated the new rules make only minor changes and are insufficient. "The regulations would only modify the 'accommodation,' under which the mandate still applies and still requires provision of the objectionable coverage," said the Most Rev. Joseph Kurtz, archbishop of Louisville, Ky., and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.     John DiCamillo, a staff ethicist at the National Catholic Bioethics Center, said he believed the new system is likely inadequate because it continues to use insurance plans provided by Catholic institutions as a vehicle for providing birth control, which would make them complicit in something they consider to be evil.     The administration's latest proposal appears to follow closely the action ordered by the Supreme Court when it granted the early July injunction temporarily shielding Wheaton College, a Christian school in Illinois, from the requirement. As a result, it isn't clear how far future legal challenges could go.     Under the new system, institutions would have to tell the federal government which company administers their health-insurance plan, and the government would then contact that administrator to ask it to arrange contraception coverage for the institution's employees. Many administrators would turn to a traditional insurance company to fund the benefits, and the insurance company would later be reimbursed by the federal government.

"Today's announcement reinforces our commitment to providing women with access to coverage for contraception, while respecting religious considerations raised by non-profit organizations and closely held for-profit companies," said Health and Human Services Secretary         Sylvia Mathews Burwell.         The system would be immediately available for religiously affiliated nonprofits that want to use it, and it would also be soon offered to the owners of for-profit companies affected by the court's decision. The administration is still working out exactly which for-profit companies are "closely held," the definition used by the Supreme Court.     Women's health groups had urged the administration to ensure that employees of religiously affiliated institutions and religious business owners retained their coverage. Many female leaders supportive of the Obama administration praised the latest arrangements but said they wanted congressional action to nullify the court's decision.     "Now that the administration has bent over backwards to accommodate religiously affiliated non-profits, it's time for these organizations to put this issue behind them and allow women to receive" affordable contraceptives, Sen.
