WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    and his top aides believe they are putting in place a new global security structure that will frame international relations for decades.Every day, however, brings a split-screen contrast between the White House's confidence in its long-term strategy and the daily chaos playing out from Ukraine to the Middle East. The disconnect is reflected in the president's declining poll ratings. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released this week shows Americans' approval of his foreign-policy record at a new low of 36%.              Richard Haass,    president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Obama has contributed to the confusion about his goals. "It's not clear in many cases what he is trying to achieve," he said.               Mr. Obama appears increasingly frustrated with his inability to tamp down the notion that American influence has waned on his watch, which some critics of his foreign policy say is evidenced by the confluence of crises.     "Apparently, people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world, and so our diplomatic efforts often take time," he said at a recent news conference. "That's the nature of world affairs. It's not neat, and it's not smooth."                                                                                                                                                     When Mr. Obama was asked Wednesday about U.S. relations with Kenya, where his father was from, at a news conference capping his first-ever Africa summit, he said: "Many times we will work with countries even though they are not perfect on every issue."     Mr. Obama's aides describe the president's approach to foreign affairs as taking "the long view." They also concede it isn't conducive to the daily cycle of crises.     "There is a sense that in many parts of the world, we need to shape a new order that can prevent conflict and resolve differences and facilitate constructive relations," said         Ben Rhodes,    one of Mr. Obama's deputy national security advisers. "His role in each of these areas is to essentially be the person who is shaping that new order."                                                                                                                                That means prodding European leaders to be more assertive on the world stage, including taking a tougher stance with Russia. In Asia, Mr. Obama sees the U.S. as the key mediator in disputes, particularly between China and its neighbors. And in the Middle East, White House officials say the president's policy is driven by the goal of protecting America's "core" interests, including strengthening allies' counterterrorism capabilities and curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions.              Brian Katulis,    a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, describes the two worlds that emerged this summer, "one that's chaotic and is begging for the U.S. to get deeply involved again—whether it's Syria, Iraq or Gaza—and this other one where the president and his most senior officials are spending most of their time, which is trying to build a zone of stability and prosperity. Whether that adds up to some sort of new international order remains to be seen," he said.     The president's resistance to being dragged into the daily melee has created some odd juxtapositions. In the hours after       Malaysia Airlines    Flight 17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Obama made a brief statement about the downing at the top of an economic speech that criticized Republicans, joked with fellow diners over a burger at a Delaware eatery, and flew to New York for Democratic fundraisers. And when the situation between Israel and Hamas was deteriorating rapidly, Mr. Obama flew to California for a series of Democratic fundraisers.     Such images have prompted even some White House allies to question the approach.     "The one thing that they have to be careful of is sometimes they just look slow in responding, and that can be dangerous," said         Robert Gibbs,    Mr. Obama's former press secretary.                                                 President Barack Obama speaks about foreign policy and other issues at a news conference on Wednesday.          Associated Press                                                                                                             Mr. Obama's critics and foreign-policy experts say it isn't just his style but his policy prescriptions that have emboldened players such as Russian President      Vladimir Putin        and even Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    to challenge U.S. authority.               Jon Alterman,    director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Obama's middle-of-the-road approach to the Arab-Israeli peace process left both sides feeling he was unsympathetic to their cause.     "He's cerebral in part of the world that's looking for the visceral," Mr. Alterman said.     With Russia, Mr. Obama's former ambassador in Moscow,         Michael McFaul,    said the administration should put more emphasis on assisting Ukraine with economic relief and political outreach in the east.      "There's been way too much focus just on trying to change Putin's mind," he said.     White House officials say Mr. Obama's foreign-policy doctrine isn't a match for anyone seeking a quick fix, because it is designed to set the U.S. on a course to lead over the long term.     "Basically, the president has to position the U.S. to lead for the next 10, 20 or 30 years, while also avoiding direct threats that could pose a risk to American interests in the near term," said Mr. Rhodes.
