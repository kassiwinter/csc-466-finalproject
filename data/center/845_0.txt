WASHINGTON—U.S. workers have filed nearly 33.5 million applications for unemployment benefits in the seven weeks since closures were put in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic, showing a wave of layoffs that likely pushed April job losses to record levels.U.S. workers filed 3.2 million jobless claims last week, the Labor Department said. It was the fewest since the week ended March 14, before the pandemic caused claims to spike, but still fifteen-times early March readings. Recent layoffs are expected to cause nonfarm payrolls to fall by 21.5 million and the unemployment rate to climb to 16% in the April jobs report, which will be released on Friday, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Both numbers would be highs on records back to the late 1930s and late ’40s. The previous peak unemployment rate was 10.8% in 1982. The largest monthly jobs loss, 1.96 million, occurred at the end of World War II.                                               As coronavirus closures continue to put businesses on life support, a record number of people are filing jobless claims to overwhelmed state labor departments. WSJ explains why some states are struggling under the historic load.

Combined with the rise in unemployment and the loss of jobs in March, Friday’s figures are expected to show the labor market’s sharp reversal since February, when joblessness was at a half-century low of 3.5% and the country notched a record 113 straight months of job creation.               “April will be the worst single month of this episode, and probably the worst single-month on record for a long time,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP. “The speed of this is so phenomenal,” she added. “The economy fell off a cliff.”        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSAre jobless claims starting to taper off where you live? Join the conversation below.        Numerous companies have announced expected layoffs or possible cuts in recent days, including United Airlines Holdings Inc., MGM Resorts and General Electric Co. Technology companies are cutting as well, with home rental website Airbnb Inc. announcing it would lay off 1,900 people, and ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc. saying it was laying off 3,700.      The April job loss figure will likely be less than the unemployment claims total because payroll numbers only capture jobs lost from mid-March to mid-April and don’t count those who were previously unemployed or weren’t on payrolls, including self-employed workers such as Uber drivers.      The decline also will be partially offset by job increases at online retailers, delivery services and other firms that hired last month.     Thursday’s unemployment benefits data raise the possibility that the worst of virus-related layoffs are in the past, and that job losses will ease in May. Benefits applications filed for the week ended May 2 were less than half the peak of 6.9 million touched in late March. Before March, fewer than 700,000 claims were filed weekly in records back to 1967.     “The steady decline in jobless claims over the past five weeks signals that the initial shock to the jobs market is over,” said John Silvia, economist at Dynamic Economic Strategy. “As states open up, the jobs market will improve.” He added the historically low unemployment rates that existed before the coronavirus-induced shock won’t return in the near term as many firms restructure or go out of business.     Economists say it could still be many months before the labor market returns to a point when U.S. employers consistently add more jobs than they subtract. And it probably will take years for the economy to fully replace the millions of jobs lost in March and April.     Some companies have increased hiring and others are placing workers back on payrolls to qualify for loan forgiveness from the government. Other businesses are bringing employees back as they see some increase in demand. Businesses are being allowed to reopen in South Carolina, Georgia, Texas and elsewhere, though often with restrictions.     Those actions should put downward pressure on new claims and the number of workers on unemployment rolls in the coming weeks. Pushing against that, enhanced unemployment benefits mean many low-wage workers earn more in jobless aid than they did at their prior jobs. And some Americans face barriers to re-entering the workforce, including lack of child care and underlying health conditions.     Jobless claims are applications by laid-off workers for unemployment-insurance payments—not all of which are approved. Each claim is made by an individual person and that person can’t file another claim until their previous request was either rejected or their benefits expire.     Famous Dave’s of America Inc., a restaurant chain that operates in 31 states, furloughed 2,700 workers in March—about 85% of the staff, Chief Executive         Jeff Crivello    said. Doing so allowed workers to tap unemployment benefits, including an additional $600 in weekly federal relief included in the stimulus package, he said.          The restaurant chain has recalled some of those workers in recent weeks, first to assist with delivery and takeout services and now to reopen restaurants in Tennessee and Oklahoma. Mr. Crivello said he expects most workers to return, even those whose unemployment benefits exceed their forgone wages. “People are interested and willing to come back,” he said.     However, there is also a risk that the increase in unemployment will have follow-on effects in the form of lower consumer spending. That could cause an acceleration in job losses again later this year, or turn temporary furloughs into permanent layoffs. Retailers J.Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus recently filed for bankruptcy, weeks after temporarily closing stores due to the virus. Other retailers reorganizing in bankruptcy close stores as part of turnaround plans.                While millions of workers filed for benefits in March and April, many waited weeks to receive payments and some say they still aren’t receiving the benefits they expected. Wisconsin, the last state to payout the extra $600 in unemployment benefits authorized as part of the stimulus package, only began making such payments last week.      Olivia Ebertz, 29, a freelance camera operator in Brooklyn, N.Y., applied for unemployment benefits in late March. She said she was able to initially navigate the unemployment system without trouble, but thinks the $743 in weekly benefits she’s receiving is less than she is entitled to, and only about a half of her typical pay. Ms. Ebertz said she was unable to reach authorities to contest her amount until Wednesday. State officials said that they are looking into her appeal.      Her partner is also newly unemployed, causing the couple to dip into savings to cover their housing costs.      “Right now I feel kind of afloat but if the monetary determination isn’t adjusted…the insecurity I currently feel will turn into a very real problem,” she said.
