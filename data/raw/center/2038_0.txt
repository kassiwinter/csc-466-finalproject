Russia engaged for years in systematic state-sponsored doping to improve athletic performance, said a commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which recommended that Russian track-and-field competitors be barred from the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.The 323-page report released Monday by the independent commission described a secret doping program allegedly run for at least the past five years by Russian government officials, physicians, coaches, and track-and-field athletes to give the country a prohibited edge in international competitions. The report said Russian athletes unwilling to participate in the program faced expulsion from their team and other threats. “It’s worse than we thought,” Dick Pound, chairman of the three-person commission that prepared the report, said at a news conference in Geneva. “We found coverups, we found destruction of samples, we found payments of money in order to conceal doping tests.”                                         An independent commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency has recommended Russian track-and-field athletes be suspended from Olympic competition in 2016 after it found that Russia engaged in state-sponsored doping.                                                                                                     The report sets out the biggest scandal in the 16-year history of WADA, which didn’t exist in the 1960 and ’70s, when the Soviet Union and East Germany were known to engage in state-sponsored doping. It also represents the largest threat to the reputation of the Olympic movement since the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, in which Olympic officials received hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and gifts in exchange for supporting Salt Lake’s bid for the 2002 Olympics, officials said.                                                                                                                                                      The report also alleged that Russian security services interfered with the Moscow antidoping lab ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics as part of a conspiracy that involved all levels of Russian sport. During the Sochi Games, Russia pulled off a stunning turnaround from its performance in Vancouver in 2010, where it won three gold medals and 15 overall. In 2014, Russia won 13 gold medals and 33 overall.                In Moscow, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said the report failed to back up its allegations of state-sponsored doping. “If you read the report, it’s written something like: ‘According to our information, there is state influence through the ministry on this whole system, we have no evidence but believe [the influence] is there,’ ” Mr. Mutko said in an interview with the Interfax news agency. “What kind of accusation is that?”     The report itself said that “evidence of extensive doping is supported and confirmed by audio and video evidence, scientific evidence, corroborative statements, cyber analysis and related reporting documents.”      Its accusations depict a cloak-and-dagger atmosphere in Russian track and field, where athletes were allegedly coerced into bribing officials to cover up positive doping tests, subjected to threats and forced to hand over a percentage of their winnings, at times under scrutiny of state security services. One athlete, speaking anonymously to the commission, said anyone with misgivings about the team’s practices would think: “Leave it, otherwise you might accidentally get in a car accident.”      The report alleges that the cheating in Russia was allowed to persist in part with the complicity of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for international track and field, whose responsibilities include drug testing. Among “highly placed members and officials of IAAF,” the report said, “there existed a consistent disregard for ethical behavior and a conspiracy to conduct and conceal corrupt behavior.”     Not included in its report, the commission said, is evidence of alleged IAAF wrongdoing that the commission said it dug up and turned over to legal authorities. Last week French authorities said they opened a criminal probe into the recently retired president of IAAF, Lamine Diack, for alleged acceptance of bribes to cover up Russian doping results. Mr. Diack couldn’t be reached to comment. The commission said it hopes to release the remainder of its IAAF-related evidence before the end of the year.     The commission recommended that punishments be meted out to five Russian athletes, four coaches and one physician. It also said WADA should withdraw accreditation from Russia’s national anti-doping agency and its anti-doping laboratory. It also recommended suspending the laboratory’s work and removing its director.     The commission, however, lacks enforcement power, creating a situation many in the antidoping community find absurd: Charged with deciding whether to ban Russian track-and-field athletes from the Rio Olympics is the IAAF, the very federation that is alleged in the commission’s report to have helped conceal that team’s doping transgressions.      That scenario heightened calls for drug-testing authority to be removed from sport federations. “You can’t promote and police at the same time, because there is an inherent conflict of interest,” said         Travis Tygart,    chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, in an interview Monday.      The IOC plans to use the WADA report to build momentum for the creation of an independent, international organization charged with overseeing and administering all drug testing, according to a person with knowledge of the organization’s strategy. IOC President         Thomas Bach    has said he supports such an entity, which Mr. Tygart estimated would need an annual budget of $75 million to 100 million.      The IAAF said its president, Sebastian Coe, the British former Olympic champion who took office in August, “has taken the urgent step of seeking approval from his fellow IAAF Council Members to consider sanctions against the Russian Athletics Federation.These sanctions could include provisional and full suspension and the removal of future IAAF events.”     “Our athletes, partners and fans have my total assurance that where there are failures in our governance or our antidoping programs we will fix them,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe, the British former Olympic champion who took office in August. “We will do whatever it takes to protect the clean athletes and rebuild trust in our sport.”     A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee called the report “deeply shocking.” The IOC said the IAAF should do “whatever it takes to protect the clean athletes and rebuild trust in our sport.”      The report could result in the rescinding of medals won by Russian athletes. It said Russian athletes who shouldn’t have been allowed to compete in the 2012 Olympics were allowed to do so. A year later, Russian athletes topped the gold-medal table at the track-and-field world championships in Moscow. Alysia Montaño, a U.S. Olympic 800-meter runner, reacted to the reports’ finding on Twitter, posting on Monday: “Medals I could be upgraded to: 2010 Silver, 2011 Bronze, 2012 Olympic Bronze, 2013 Bronze.” Ms. Montano said not being awarded those medals cost her “at least $600,000” since 2010, in combination of prize money and performance bonuses that would have been paid by her sponsors.     The WADA commission was launched after ARD, a German television channel, broadcast a documentary last December called, “Top Secret Doping: How Russia Makes Its Winners.” Besides Mr. Pound, a Canadian lawyer and former vice president of the IOC, the other two members of the commission were Richard McLaren, a Canadian sports lawyer and a long-standing member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and Günter Younger, a German who heads head of cybercrime department at the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office.      Two Russian runners who received bans for doping, Yulia Stepanova and Liliya Shobukhova, blew open the doping scandal by speaking publicly alongside their husbands to the German television channel, and in Ms. Stepanova’s case, filming undercover videos and handing over evidence. Ms. Shobukhova admitted that she paid €450,000 ($483,000) to cover up her positive results.      In the months following the German broadcast and the commission’s establishment, Russia’s track-and-field program came under intense scrutiny and results at top competitions suffered. No Russian athletes were invited to compete in this month’s New York City Marathon for a variety of concerns, including Russia’s anti-doping standards, according to a spokesman for the race. Russia posted its worst performance ever at a track-and-field championship, this summer in Beijing, where it earned only four medals.      The WADA commission’s report alleged that Grigory Rodchenkov, director of the Russian main antidoping testing lab, admitted to intentionally destroying 1,417 urine samples ahead of a WADA audit of the samples.      According to the report, Mr. Rodchenkov said he didn’t understand a WADA directive to maintain all the samples, an explanation the investigative commission did not find credible. According to the report, the Russians set up a second lab to screen samples for positive results before sending them to the accredited laboratory, and also tipped off athletes of upcoming tests.     The commission concluded that Mr. Rodchenkov was “at the heart” of a widespread coverup of positive doping tests among Russian athletes and an “integral part” of a conspiracy to extort money from athletes.      The commission also said an officer from the state security service met regularly with Mr. Rodchenkov to be kept abreast on the situation at the center, calling into question its independence. The Federal Security Service didn’t respond to a request for comment.      Mr. Rodchenkov said in a statement to AllSportInfo.ru on Monday that the commission’s report reflected a “peculiar interpretation of reality.”      “Our Anti-Doping Center has made an enormous contribution to improving the methodology of identifying new doping agents, evidenced by the list of our publications and professional awards in recent years,” Mr. Rodchenkov said, describing it as the “pride of Russian science.”     While criticizing the report, Mr. Mutko, the Russian sports minister, also struck a conciliatory note, emphasizing that Russia would implement any final recommendations from the international organizations involved.      A number of other Russian officials immediately dismissed the report as yet another example of the West’s unfair bias against Russia. Vasily Shestakov, a friend and former judo partner of Russian President      Vladimir Putin        and a member of the Russian parliament, suggested it was intentional.      “Naturally, one of the goals of the authors of this dubious sensation… was to disrupt preparation and demoralize Russian athletes ahead of the 2016 Olympics and in general discredit Russia as a great sports power,” Mr. Shestakov said.
