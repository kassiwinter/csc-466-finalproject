                                                                                                                                         President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to allege, without specific evidence, that there was massive voter fraud in the election he just won.                                                                                                                                                      In one tweet, Mr. Trump also attacked the media and accused it of not reporting on “serious voter fraud” in three states won by Democrat Hillary Clinton.                                                                                                                                                      “Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!” he tweeted.                                                                                                                                                                    On Monday officials in Wisconsin will announce a recount in that state, which Mr. Trump won, at the request of the Green Party and candidate Jill Stein. Mr. Trump’s tweets seem to be pushback at the claims among some Democrats and progressives (also made without evidence) of a rigged election in key swing states.                                                                                                                              Mr. Trump alleged an even bigger fraud earlier Sunday, saying (again without proof) that “millions” of illegal immigrants had voted for Mrs. Clinton.                                                                                                                                                                 “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Mr. Trump said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And in a sign that liberals and progressives are getting under his skin, he rebutted their frequent (and irrelevant) claim that Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote, which would somehow undermine Mr. Trump’s legitimacy.                                                                                                                   “It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!” he said over two tweets.
