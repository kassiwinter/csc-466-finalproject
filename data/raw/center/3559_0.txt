At a joint press conference with the U.K. leader Friday, Mr. Trump referred to a “tough” and “brutal” negotiating ploy he had suggested Mrs. May try in her discussions with Brussels over the terms of Britain’s planned exit from the EU.      He didn’t say exactly what he offered but said Mrs. May didn’t follow it.     In a Sunday interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs. May was asked what Mr. Trump’s suggestion was.          “He told me I should sue the EU,” she said. She didn’t elaborate.          Talks between London and Brussels over the terms of Britain’s withdrawal are stuck in the slow lane more than two years after the U.K. voted to leave the bloc in a referendum.     The U.K.’s exit is penciled in for March 2019, yet the outline of the U.K.’s future economic ties to the EU have yet to be agreed, in large part a consequence of internal disagreement within Mrs. May’s ruling Conservatives over just how close those links should be.     Mrs. May has sought to unite warring factions of her government behind a compromise plan for a U.K.-EU free-trade area with uniform regulations for goods, including food, effectively set by the EU. This would speed movement of goods between Britain and the bloc while preserving British autonomy over regulation for many services, including financial services—a key goal.     The proposals led to the resignations of two senior members of her cabinet, Boris Johnson and David Davis, hard-line Brexit backers who argued the plan would leave the U.K. as a “rule-taker” from Brussels. A handful of junior members of her government also quit.                                         Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said they are committed to a post-Brexit trade deal, despite the U.S. president's earlier criticism of her handling of the U.K.’s Brexit process. Mr. Trump's visit was met with protests in London.

Mr. Trump appeared to pour cold water on that idea during in an interview with a British newspaper Thursday, though he later rowed back and expressed support.     Mrs. May’s Brexit strategy will this week face fresh tests in Parliament, where pro- and anti-Brexit lawmakers are poised to try to alter aspects of the government’s plan.     Mrs. May on Sunday appealed to fellow Conservatives to get behind her.     “Let’s keep our eyes on the prize. The prize is delivering on leaving the EU in a way that is in our national interest,” she said.     Mrs. May also pledged to resist any attempt to unseat her should a formal challenge to her leadership be made.
