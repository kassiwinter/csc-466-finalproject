 
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday a spate of sexual assault scandals surrounding the military shows enlisted women are "putting up with way too much crap."
"I want to salute the women who serve and are putting up with way too much crap," the military prosecutor, said on "Fox News Sunday." "This needs to end. When a victim comes forward, they should have an advocate to walk them through the military justice system. And commanders who allow this to continue to flourish, quite frankly, should be fired. The president spoke well of this problem. It is a disgrace to the United States Military."
In the past month, two officers charged with preventing sexual assault have been arrested and an enlisted soldier was charged with secretly filming female cadets at the United States Military Academy.
