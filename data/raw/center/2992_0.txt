         Mitt Romney    arrives in Tampa, Fla., next week to accept the GOP presidential nomination in front of a national television audience. Once there, he's also expected to greet a more exclusive group: 1,500 top fundraisers who've helped give the Republican a financial edge over President         Barack Obama.    The Romney campaign has created a special package of exclusive events reserved for elite donors, such as the "Stars" who have raised at least $250,000 and "Stripes," who have raised at least $500,000, according to their itineraries.                                                 Workers raise bunches of balloons to be dropped at the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday in Tampa, Fla.          Reuters                                                                                                             That includes a private event where Mr. Romney is expected to make an appearance, access to receptions hosted by Republican Party insiders and music stars—The Oak Ridge Boys and a former member of The Eagles—and prized rooms in the Marriott where Mr. Romney himself will stay. Depending on how much they've done for the campaign, top donors are also invited to luxury suites in the convention hall to hear Mr. Romney's acceptance speech.     "This will be a flagship taking-care-of-donors convention," said         Woody Johnson,    owner of the New York Jets and head of Mr. Romney's fundraising in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. "It's Sales 101—you want to do everything you can to encourage people to raise money."               The Romney campaign's close attention to its top donors could be one reason why today it has more available to spend than the Obama campaign, an unusual outcome because incumbent presidents typically carry a financial advantage over their challengers. During the 2004 election, President         George W. Bush     took in $270 million compared to $235 million for Sen.         John Kerry.         "It's nice to be recognized, to feel like you're participating in something you believe in," said Bill Kilberg, a Romney fundraiser who has brought in checks for President         George H.W. Bush,    his son and Sen.         John McCain.    "Things have changed. There's more courting of contributors and people who raise money than there was before."                                                                                                                                                     Republican convention planners said some 1,500 top party donors requested hotel rooms in Tampa, almost twice as many as Republicans originally expected, they say. When Mr. Bush ran for reelection in 2004, about 800 elite donors attended the convention, the Republican National Committee says. Moreover, the flurry of activity in Tampa, which also includes a raft of company-sponsored parties, is evidence of corporate enthusiasm for the Republican ticket.     While Mr. Obama and the Democrats will also offer an array of perks to top donors when the party meets in Charlotte in early September, the Democratic convention isn't expected to feature a similar array of events, either from the Obama campaign or corporate sponsors.           More           This time around, many fundraisers from the corporate world aren't backing Mr. Obama's campaign with the same level of support they showed in 2008. The dropoff is reflected among Wall Street backers, but also reaches beyond that realm. Mr. Obama doesn't accept donations from lobbyists or corporate political action committees, while some corporate chiefs complain his administration has been hostile to business. And some labor unions are skipping the convention—upset it's being held in a state that restricts unions' organizing efforts.     The official function of a political convention—the selection of a nominee—is now fulfilled long beforehand. Its events serve two other important purposes: introducing a candidate to a prime-time television audience for one hour each evening; and, during the rest of the time, showing love and appreciation to donors.     On Monday, top Romney donors are invited to a private reception with former Florida Gov.         Jeb Bush,    current Florida Gov.         Rick Scott     and the country band The Oak Ridge Boys. Tuesday starts with a private event with former Secretary of State         Condoleezza Rice.    After Mr. Romney's speech Thursday night, donors can mingle with The Eagles's former lead guitarist,         Don Felder,    at a reception dubbed "An Evening at the Hotel California."     Big companies, in turn, are reciprocating the appreciation by splashing out their own events for delegates. Tuesday will feature a performance by country music star         Trace Adkins    underwritten by the nuclear energy industry. Phone and cable companies are shelling out up to $50,000 apiece to give delegates, lobbyists and lawmakers on Congress's telecommunications committees the opportunity to try to smack a home run Wednesday at Tropicana Field, the home of baseball's Tampa Bay Rays.     The coal industry and hi-tech companies are sponsoring concerts with Lynyrd Skynyrd,         Kid Rock     and Journey. Others are throwing a a big Wisconsin-style tailgate Wednesday to prepare for the acceptance speech of vice-presidential nominee         Paul Ryan,    a Wisconsin Congressman, later that night.              Ron Bonjean,    a Republican strategist who is helping to organize the concerts and promote the "Beers and Brats Bash," says there's been "a serious upswing" in the number of events, concerts and parties planned this year. Mr. Bonjean said the concerts are close to selling out the 2,500 tickets per night and tailgate organizers have doubled their original order of bratwursts and Miller Lite.     The attention given to fundraisers has been a signature of the Romney campaign. In June, Mr. Romney feted some 700 donors at a retreat in Park City, Utah, that featured a barbecue and ski jumpers. Shortly after Mr. Romney introduced Mr. Ryan as his running mate for the first time earlier this month, the two men held a conference call with the campaign's elite fundraisers.      There is also a so-called Council of 100 made up of those who have pledged to raise at least $1 million for the campaign that receive other perks, multiple people familiar with the group said.     As of July 31, Mr. Romney and the RNC had a total of $185.9 million available to spend, counting his reelection account and funds raised with the RNC. Mr. Obama reported a combined $126.9 million with the Democratic National Committee.     About 71% of Mr. Romney's money had come from those who gave at least $1,000 as of June 30, according to a study by the Campaign Finance Institute. By contrast, 30% of Mr. Obama's money had come from that crowd.      One delicate matter is figuring out how to reward the biggest backers without appearing to shun those lower down the ladder. The itinerary for Tampa looks much the same for each donor, but each offers slightly different experiences.     Top-tier donors will have access to their own club box in the convention hall to watch speeches. They will also be invited to show up at some events earlier to see guest speakers in a more intimate setting.     "The better performers will have a little better view," said the New York Jets's Mr. Johnson, "maybe being on the 50-yard line instead of the 100-yard line."
