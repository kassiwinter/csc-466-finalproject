         Roger Stone,    a longtime political adviser to President         Trump,    was arrested Friday after a federal grand jury accused him of lying to Congress to cover up his efforts to obtain and share with Trump campaign officials plans by WikiLeaks to publish emails Russian hackers stole from Democrats in 2016. In a seven-count indictment obtained Thursday by special counsel Robert Mueller, Mr. Stone was also charged with obstructing the congressional inquiry and trying to persuade a witness to lie to a House committee. The indictment describes contacts between Mr. Stone and Trump campaign aides, and it alleges Mr. Stone told the now-president’s senior campaign officials as early as June 2016 that he knew WikiLeaks possessed documents damaging to Democrat         Hillary Clinton.         A colorful figure who has been a confidant to Mr. Trump for decades, the 66-year-old Mr. Stone becomes the latest person to be ensnared in Mr. Mueller’s nearly two-year-old probe into whether Trump associates aided Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, which Mr. Trump and Moscow have both denied.     The special counsel’s office has obtained guilty pleas and convictions at trial of multiple senior Trump advisers, several of whom admitted to misleading investigators about contacts with Russians or Russian intermediaries. Among those, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer         Michael Cohen    admitted in November that he lied to Congress to play down Mr. Trump’s involvement in efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.               The indictment depicts Mr. Stone as a central figure in a web of go-betweens who collectively helped the Trump campaign gain intelligence about future WikiLeaks email dumps that could harm Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. It suggests Mr. Stone aimed to be a two-way conduit of information: Months after Democrats disclosed they had been hacked by Russian actors, the Trump campaign asked him what he knew about WikiLeaks’ plans, and Mr. Stone, via intermediaries, sought to communicate with the website about what specific Clinton emails would be helpful. It doesn’t allege that Trump campaign officials were in direct contact with WikiLeaks.     Mr. Stone said Friday he would plead not guilty.     “There is no circumstance, whatsoever, under which I will bear false witness against the president,” Mr. Stone said.        
Related        In the forward to a new version of his 2017 book scheduled to be released next month, Mr. Stone wrote: “Mr. Mueller may frame me for some bogus charge in order to silence me or induce me to testify against the president.”     Mr. Mueller appears to be continuing to look at Mr. Stone. Friday, Kristin Davis, the self-described “Manhattan Madam” who has close ties to Mr. Stone, confirmed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched the New York duplex she shares with Mr. Stone and his wife.     Former prosecutors said Mr. Mueller appears to be using the case against Mr. Stone to lay out what he has uncovered about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia’s 2016 efforts.     “If this were simply the prosecution of a dirty trickster who lied about it to Congress, you could have done that in half the number of pages or less,” said former federal prosecutor Joseph Moreno.     The indictment alleges that on July 22, 2016, after WikiLeaks released a trove of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, a senior Trump campaign official “was directed to contact” Mr. Stone about any further releases the website had planned and to learn “what other damaging information” the organization possessed on the Clinton campaign.      Mr. Stone told the Trump campaign about potential future disclosures by WikiLeaks, the indictment says.     Five days later, Mr. Trump made a public plea: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” referring to a trove of messages from Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary of state that became a central issue in the 2016 campaign.     The indictment doesn’t specify who directed the official to contact Mr. Stone. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the emails published by WikiLeaks were stolen by Russian hackers.     Mr. Stone was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He appeared in federal court there on Friday wearing a dark blue polo shirt and bound in handcuffs and a heavy chain around his waist. He was released on $250,000 bond.                                         Longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone was indicted Friday in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on seven counts, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian tampering in the 2016 presidential election.

Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said the indictment “does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else.” Mr. Trump, who also has repeatedly dismissed the Mueller probe, did so again on Friday, saying on Twitter: “Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country. NO COLLUSION!”     White House press secretary         Sarah Sanders    on Friday declined to respond to questions about whether Mr. Trump had directed a campaign official to contact Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks’ plans.        
Mueller Targets: Who’s WhoPeople who have surfaced in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and how they fit into the picture.        The 24-page indictment accuses Mr. Stone of lying to the House Intelligence Committee in May 2017 when he told it he had no records relevant to the panel’s investigation into Russian interference, and later in September 2017 testimony.     Mr. Stone exchanged numerous emails and text messages in 2016 about WikiLeaks, which published emails that Russian hackers stole from Clinton campaign chairman         John Podesta’s    account, according to the indictment. Mr. Stone had also discussed his efforts to contact Julian Assange, the founder of the website who has been in self-imposed house arrest in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012, according to the indictment and emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.     On Oct. 3, 2016, according to the indictment, Mr. Stone told a reporter at Breitbart News, whose chairman was Trump campaign Chief Executive         Steve Bannon,    about Clinton emails in Mr. Assange’s possession. That day, Mr. Stone sent an email to a “supporter involved with the Trump Campaign” that read: “The payload is still coming,” according to the indictment.     The next day, according to the indictment, Mr. Stone responded to an email from a “high-ranking Trump Campaign official,” telling the official that WikiLeaks would release “a load every week going forward.” That campaign official is Mr. Bannon, according to a person familiar with the correspondence. Mr. Bannon’s lawyer declined to comment.

Three days later, on Oct. 7, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly accused the Russian government of trying to interfere in the coming U.S. elections. Minutes later, the Washington Post published the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which Mr. Trump is recorded making lewd comments about women.     Within an hour, WikiLeaks released the first set of Podesta emails, and an associate of Mr. Bannon texted Mr. Stone: “Well done,” according to the indictment.     Neither WikiLeaks nor Mr. Assange are named in the indictment but are identifiable based on details in the court filing.     The indictment also alleges Mr. Stone lied to the House panel in his September 2017 testimony when he said his alleged backchannel to WikiLeaks was a longtime friend, New York radio personality Randy Credico. Mr. Credico, who is identifiable as “Person 2” in the indictment, has denied being Mr. Stone’s backchannel. According to the indictment, Mr. Credico repeatedly urged Mr. Stone to tell the truth.     Mr. Stone also sought to discourage Mr. Credico from testifying before the House Committee, according to the indictment and previous interviews with Mr. Credico. Mr. Credico declined to comment Friday, but he has told the Journal that Mr. Stone used him as a “fall guy.”     The indictment alleges Mr. Stone had asked his contacts to pass on a request to Mr. Assange for documents potentially damaging to the Clinton campaign. In one September 2016 email, for example, Mr. Stone asked Mr. Credico to ask Mr. Assange for any Clinton emails specifically about an unidentified topic from August 20, 2011, according to the indictment.     Friday, WikiLeaks said the indictment made no reference to specific conversations between Messrs. Stone and Assange.
