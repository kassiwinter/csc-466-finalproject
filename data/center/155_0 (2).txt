The House on Wednesday passed a bill to establish a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, earning relatively little support from Republicans as GOP leaders sought to quash a bill negotiated by one of their own members.Lawmakers passed the bill in a 252-175 vote, with 35 Republicans joining all Democrats in support.The legislation’s chances appear increasingly slim in the Senate after both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP scrambles to figure out what Trump legal drama means for future  Senate leaders send Putin symbolic warning shot amid invasion fears GOP boycotts Biden Fed nominees' vote as bank fights inflation MORE (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthyKevin McCarthyDC delegate: Possible bill to repeal home rule 'radical' and 'very unexpected' Press: Time for Merrick Garland to flush Donald Trump The Hill's Morning Report - World poised for war MORE (R-Calif.) came out in opposition to the bill.The GOP leaders' refusal to back the bill threatens the chances of the proposed commission becoming law as many Republicans seek to divert attention from former President TrumpDonald TrumpHillicon Valley — Cyberattack hits Ukrainian defense On The Money — GOP senators block Biden's Fed picks Florida county clerk's typo directed ticketed drivers to site selling Trump merchandise MORE’s role and their own involvement echoing his false claims of election fraud leading up to the insurrection.McCarthy insisted that the legislation should have expanded its scope, arguing it “ignores the political violence that has struck American cities, a Republican Congressional baseball practice, and, most recently, the deadly attack on Capitol Police on April 2, 2021.” Expanding the commission's focus would dilute the focus on Trump.The GOP leader's opposition came even though the legislation was negotiated by the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep.

So let's take a deep breath and think about what's really important here. These people every single day are willing to lay down their lives for us. They deserve better," he said.Relatively few Republicans participated in floor debate on the commission legislation, with Katko, who was managing time for Republicans, repeatedly reserving time.While only a handful of Katko’s fellow Republicans spoke in support of the bill he negotiated, Democrats repeatedly praised him as a “true American.”Democrats emphasized that the compromise bill on the floor on Wednesday incorporated GOP demands that the commission include an equal ratio of Democrats and Republicans and coequal subpoena power.

They’d be tasked with issuing a final report by the end of this year.“What is important, and the reason I was willing to — we as a group were willing to — yield on certain points which we thought were, shall we say, contradictory to past Republican behavior when it came appointing commissions was that we wanted the American people to have the fullest confidence in the product that there is,” Pelosi said ahead of the vote.McConnell further dimmed the bill’s prospects in the Senate Wednesday, calling the bill a “slanted and unbalanced proposal.”"There is, has been and there will continue to be no shortage of robust investigations by two separate branches of the federal government," McConnell said."It's not at all clear what new facts or additional investigation yet another commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress," he added.And before McConnell’s announcement on Wednesday, Trump issued a statement on Tuesday night opposing the commission that specifically called out the top two GOP leaders."Republicans in the House and Senate should not approve the Democrat trap of the January 6 Commission. ... Republicans must get much tougher and much smarter, and stop being used by the Radical Left. Hopefully, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy are listening!" Trump said in the statement.Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Charles SchumerChuck SchumerAmerican unity is key to a Europe whole and free Anxious Democrats want Biden to speed up vetting for Supreme Court pick Democratic Senate debates merits of passion vs. pragmatism MORE (D-N.Y.) affirmed Wednesday that he will bring up the legislation for a vote.“It will be on the Senate floor, and we’ll see where our Republican friends stand. Will they stand with the truth, or will they stand with the big lie?” Schumer said.The tension in Congress over creating the commission stands in stark contrast to outside voices largely unified in the call for an independent commission to investigate the event.More than 140 national security leaders who served under Democratic and Republican administrations called for such a commission in April, saying such a review was “critical to preventing future attacks.”And former members of the 9/11 Commission — which the bill was modeled after — slammed Republicans for trying to rope in events that happened as far back as four years ago.“Jan. 6 was a highly unique event. It is different than almost any other time in our nation's history,” said Tim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman who served on the 9/11 Commission.“That is an extraordinarily different situation than what some people are talking about in terms of protests in cities,” he added.
