The court is scheduled to hear arguments in the two cases on Feb. 22 and March 1, respectively.
The Biden administration has already announced plans to discontinue construction of the border wall and suspend the asylum program. That action potentially makes the cases moot.                                                                                  © 2022 Thomson/Reuters.
