WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a decision on whether religious merchants have a constitutional right to deny service to gay people, instead ruling narrowly that a Christian baker didn’t get a fair hearing before a state civil-rights commission.The court’s decision brought an inconclusive end to one of the most contentious social issues on the justices’ docket, the first major follow-on to the 2015 decision affording same-sex couples the same marriage rights as those held by opposite-sex couples. Monday’s decision—saying that Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. in Lakewood, Colo., couldn’t be sanctioned for turning away a same-sex couple—all but ensured that the underlying conflict between gay-rights backers and religious conservatives soon would return to the court. In two separate concurring opinions and a dissent, seven of the justices laid down markers for the battles to come.     It may not take long for the opening guns to sound. The court is scheduled to consider at its private meeting on Thursday whether to hear a Richland, Wash., florist’s appeal of a state Supreme Court decision finding that she violated state law by refusing to sell wedding flowers to a same-sex couple.               The breadth of the court’s 7-2 vote reflected how little actually was decided. Justice         Anthony Kennedy,    who wrote the 2015 same-sex marriage opinion, delivered Monday’s decision, finding that in enforcing state civil-rights law, which forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission appeared contemptuous toward Mr. Phillips’s religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.        
Related        “Phillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case,” Justice Kennedy wrote. Instead, he said, several members of the commission made remarks “implying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s business community.”     At one hearing, a commissioner said Mr. Phillips should be “able to compromise” if he expected to do business in the state. At another, a commissioner said that “religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history,” including slavery and the Holocaust.     Justice Kennedy cited such comments as evidence of “hostility to religion,” along with the commission’s refusal to sanction three other bakers who declined to produce cakes with messages attacking same-sex marriage.     “Government hostility toward people of faith has no place in our society, yet the state of Colorado was openly antagonistic toward Jack’s religious beliefs about marriage,” said Kristen Waggoner, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious advocacy group, who argued Mr. Phillips’s case.     Still, Justice Kennedy’s opinion didn’t suggest that respectful treatment of believers’ claims must translate into granting them exemptions from civil-rights laws.          Indeed, the opinion embraced none of the constitutional arguments for such exemptions that Mr. Phillips had asserted, such as his claim that baking a cake for a same-sex wedding amounted to government-compelled speech endorsing same-sex marriage or official interference with his free exercise of religion.     “The court did make clear, however, that states like Colorado may continue to protect the LGBTQ community, reaffirming principles my office has consistently defended for the past six years,” said Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican.     Justice Kennedy, who since 1996 has written a series of landmark decisions extending gay rights, signaled he was not retreating from that jurisprudence. “Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights,” he wrote.     Monday’s opinion emphasized Justice Kennedy’s view that progress toward gay rights should unfold in a civil and sensitive manner to those whom it discomforts.     But an authority he cited offered little reassurance to those seeking broad religious exemptions to civil-rights law—a 1968 case rejecting a South Carolina barbecue outlet’s claim that being forced to serve black customers violated the owner’s religious beliefs against racial integration.

Monday’s case began in 2012, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins came to Masterpiece Cakeshop to order a cake for their wedding reception. Colorado didn’t recognize same-sex marriage then, the court noted—a fact that could make claims like Mr. Phillips’s weaker today—so they planned to hold the ceremony in Massachusetts and later celebrate at home in Colorado.     Mr. Phillips told them he didn’t make cakes for same-sex weddings, though gay people were welcome to buy birthday cakes, brownies or other goods. Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins said they were shocked and humiliated, and subsequently filed a complaint with the state civil-rights division.     An administrative-law judge found for the couple, the commission approved that decision, and a state appeals court upheld the commission’s ruling. The commission cannot impose fines, but it did order Mr. Phillips to cease discriminating against gay people, train his staff in the law’s requirements and file “quarterly compliance reports” for two years.     The Colorado Supreme Court declined to review that decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court initially appeared to be in no hurry to wade in either. Mr. Phillips filed his petition in July 2016, but the court took no action until June 2017, after Justice         Neil Gorsuch’s    appointment, suggesting difficulty in finding the required four votes to put the case on the argument calendar.

But he, joined by Justice Alito, sparred in concurring opinions with Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Breyer, over Colorado’s refusal to sanction bakeries that refused to bake cakes denigrating gay marriage.     Justice Gorsuch also joined Justice         Clarence Thomas’s    separate opinion supporting the outcome but complaining that the majority should have grappled more seriously with Mr. Phillips’s free-speech claim.     Justice         Ruth Bader Ginsburg,    joined by Justice         Sonia Sotomayor,    dissented. Among other reasons, she said the commissioners’ remarks shouldn’t have invalidated the uncontested fact that Mr. Phillips turned away a same-sex couple, particularly because no allegation of religious animus had been leveled at either the administrative judge who first considered the case or the state appeals court that later reviewed the commission ruling.
