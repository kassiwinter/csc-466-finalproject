The U.S. economy was nicked by two summer hurricanes in September but is showing signs of underlying strength.The country shed 33,000 jobs in September, the first loss in seven years, the Labor Department said Friday, ending the longest stretch of job growth on record.But the picture was distorted by Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, and Irma, which hit Florida in early September. Though the measure of hiring fell, another measure of unemployment showed improvement and investors came away from the report believing the Federal Reserve remained on track to raise short-term interest rates again in December in response to an improving economy.                The storms came just before businesses filled out monthly surveys of payrolls used by the government to tabulate hiring.​Many businesses reported reduced payrolls during the survey week of Sept. 12. Employment in the restaurant industry, in particular, took a big hit, falling 105,000 in September from the month before, after averaging growth of 29,000 during the prior six months.      A separate survey of households, rather than businesses, pointed to a much stronger labor market. It showed employment actually rose sharply—by 906,000—in September from the prior month and that the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage point to 4.2%, the lowest since 2001.      The survey of businesses counts a drop in employment if a person doesn’t work and isn’t paid during the survey week. The household survey is different. It counts a person as employed as long as he or she keeps the job. That might make the household survey a more reliable gauge when business is temporarily disrupted.     The household survey suggested about 1.5 million people couldn’t show up to work last month due to bad weather—the most since an East Coast blizzard in 1996. The Labor Department said the business survey likely was distorted but that the storms had “no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate.”     “The labor market remains red hot,” said         Joseph Brusuelas,    chief economist at RSM, a large accounting and consulting firm.          Storms destroy property and wealth but can have a net positive effect on economic activity during subsequent rebuilding stages. Some analysts say the extent of damage inflicted by the last two hurricanes might accentuate that economic pattern this time.     Mr. Brusuelas said he is hearing from clients in the Houston area about accumulating labor shortages and wage pressures. He believes those problems could persist for up to two years as communities rebuild, the result of post-storm demand and also demographic pressures driving a large cohort of older workers into retirement. “Labor is going to be in short supply for a number of years looking forward,” he said.     A Rockport, Texas, donut shop is one example of what happened in the local economy around the storms. Donutsdatrock! Rockport Donuts temporarily shut because of Hurricane Harvey in August, but it quickly reopened to booming demand. Weekly sales are higher than before because hordes of construction workers are stopping by during breaks as they repair nearby buildings, said shop owner Matthew Otero.     One employee remains out of the shop so he can help his family and neighbors repair homes damaged by the storm. That is the kind of absence that would show up as a lost job in the business payroll survey tracked by the Labor Department, even though the worker will get his job back when he returns. In the meantime, Mr. Otero plans to hire contractors soon to repair a commercial space he owns across the street from his shop, and he has hired an additional worker at the shop itself to help with the extra business he’s seeing.     “The storm brings a curse to many, many, but it brings a blessing to others,” he said. “The construction is huge.”     Other gauges of economic activity suggest the economy hasn’t missed a beat. The Institute for Supply Management, a nonprofit that brings together supply managers, said its monthly indexes of activity in the U.S. manufacturing and service sectors rose in September to their highest levels in more than a decade.      Moreover September car sales hit the highest level of the year, in part because some Americans replaced cars damaged during the summer storms.     For the first time in decades, all the major global economies are growing in sync. Many economists estimate that U.S. output grew between 2% and 3% in the third quarter and expect slightly stronger growth in the fourth quarter. Output rose at an annual rate of 3.1% in the spring. That could put overall growth for the year above the sluggish 2% trend that has characterized the expansion.     The strong economic undertones, including the latest drop in the jobless rate, likely keep the Fed on course to raise short-term interest rates for a third time this year in December. Unemployment is now below the Fed’s forecast of 4.3% for the fourth quarter and it is well below the 4.6% rate at which the Fed sees an economy in balance with little inflation pressure.

Average hourly earnings rose 12 cents, or 0.45%, from a month earlier. Wages were 2.9% higher from a year earlier.      One likely factor: Many low-wage workers in restaurants or hotels were temporarily unemployed because of the storms, pushing up the overall average for a time. The Labor Department estimates that one in 13 workers had a job in counties affected by the storms in September.      Still, wages appeared to be rising even before the storm.          The payroll decline “catches your attention—it is not something that has happened in a long time,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President         Raphael Bostic    told The Wall Street Journal during an interview Friday in Austin, Texas.     “The hurricanes introduced a lot of noise,” Mr. Bostic added. “We’re going to spend time trying to understand whether a negative 33,000 is a signal or is it really noise.”     —Ben Leubsdorf and Eric Morath contributed to this article.
