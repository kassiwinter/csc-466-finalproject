                                                                                                                                         President Obama, sharpening his stump speech attacks on the Republican presidential ticket, called Mitt Romney’s economic plans “trickle-down snake oil” while campaigning in New Hampshire on Saturday.                                                                                                                                                      In a high school gym in Windham, N.H., Mr. Obama, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, continued his campaign’s focus on Mr. Romney’s tax bills, and criticized Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman tagged one week ago as Mr. Romney’s running mate.                                                                                                                                                      “Congressman Ryan … he put forward a plan that would allow Governor Romney to pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year,” the president said, drawing boos from the crowd of supporters.                                                                                                                                                                    “Their ideas are pretty simple – they’re not hard to explain,” he said at the outdoor rally. “They think … if we do more tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans, then somehow prosperity’s gonna rain down on all of us.”                                                                                                                              A few hours later, in Rochester, N.H., Mr. Obama drew cheers with an energetic defense of the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative achievement that critics have derisively called “Obamacare.”                                                                                                                                                       The president said he was proud to hear the health care reforms called “Obamacare.”
