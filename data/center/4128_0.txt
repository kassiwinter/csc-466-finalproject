WASHINGTON—President Trump is expected to issue an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to tie research and education grants made to colleges and universities to more aggressive enforcement of the First Amendment, according to a draft of the order viewed by The Wall Street Journal.The order instructs agencies including the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Defense to ensure that public educational institutions comply with the First Amendment, and that private institutions live up to their own stated free-speech standards. The order falls short of what some university officials feared would be more sweeping or specific measures; it doesn’t prescribe any specific penalty that would result in schools losing research or other education grants as a result of specific policies.     Mr. Trump announced his intention to issue an executive order concerning free speech on college campuses last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, citing allegations that conservatives on campuses across the U.S. were being silenced.          “This executive order is kind of a shot across the bow to universities that’s meant to put them on notice, that they’re being watched and scrutinized,” said Suzanne Nossel, president of Pen America, a left-leaning group that advocates for greater free expression on college campuses.     The issue of campus free expression has been a cause célèbre for years for young conservatives, who point to a series of high-profile instances in which conservative speakers have been prevented from speaking on campuses by student protests, security costs or threats of violence. Mr. Trump, in his CPAC speech, cited the case of Hayden Williams, a conservative activist who was assaulted while recruiting for a conservative political training organization at the University of California, Berkeley.     Conservative students also often complain that too few professors represent their point of view, and as a result their opinions are frequently squelched.     The directive is the latest move on the part of the Trump administration, which has been flexing unprecedented legal muscle to defend conservative students in free-speech lawsuits against their universities. The suits broadly claim the universities have violated students’ free-speech rights by restricting where or when they could hold protests or host speakers.     Cabinet agencies will be free to draw up their own guidelines that could outline what the administration considers noncompliance with the First Amendment, a senior administration official said.                                         Born on college campuses, free-speech debates have returned, leaving students, faculty and administrations caught in the crosshairs. WSJ’s Jason Bellini goes back to class to see why some students have had it with free speech.                                                                                                     “Free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation’s democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity,” the order reads. “We must encourage institutions to…avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.”     Separately, the presidential order will require the government to seek more detailed data from colleges and universities on the debt and earnings of their graduates, broken down by their major or program of study.     The goal is to allow prospective students to compare not just schools, but programs within them, before going into tens of thousands of dollars in debt for a degree that may not pay off financially.

Similar plans have faced opposition from colleges and universities, particularly among schools offering liberal-arts programs, who fear the data will make misleading comparisons between the value of a liberal arts degree and a vocational course of study, which is often shorter.     The directive on data disclosures follows an attempt by the Education Department to create a similar program last year, by building out an Obama administration effort known as the college scorecard. That program publishes averages for each college on tuition costs, debt, earnings, student-default rates and graduation rates.     The expansion of the scorecard is intended to replace another, broader effort by the Obama administration to collect program-level data on for-profit colleges, which primarily offer vocational degrees, and cut off federal funds to the worst-performing ones.     The move brings into focus the current administration’s belief that more information about the value of a college degree—rather than government moves to punish what it deems the worst actors—is the best way to create a better-functioning market in higher education.     Critics of the approach say it places too much financial accountability on students and not enough on schools. The federal government provides roughly $130 to $140 billion each year in student loans and grants, most of which flows to schools directly to cover tuition.     Colleges and universities have also in the past opposed similarly increased data requirements, citing the costs of data collection and student-privacy concerns. Colleges also argue that the financial return on a four-year degree carries much more value over time than a short-term certificate program, which lands students jobs but doesn’t necessarily promise pay increases over their lifetimes.     The senior administration official said that, once the more detailed data begins to be published, the administration can develop a more targeted mechanism to keep the worst actors accountable. The official mentioned one possible measure to place colleges on the hook if former students default on their student loans, a proposal the order doesn’t include.
