Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), one of the key swing votes, voted not to proceed to a confirmation vote for Kavanaugh. Murkowski's no was quiet - press corps all verified w each other that it was "no".— Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) October 5, 2018Conservatives are now sending her a warning.Lisa Murkowski, you represent a state that Trump won by 15 pointsYou campaigned on conservative values & putting strong judges on the courtYou have an obligation to confirm KavanaughIf not, we the grassroots will launch a primary that will end your career— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 5, 2018Murkowski has previously voted with Democrats on key bills when it comes to abortion rights. Yet, she agreed with Sen. Collins this time around that Kavanaugh was not likely to overturn Roe v. Wade. So, the source of her opposition is unclear, but we'll wait for an official statement. She could still vote "yes" on the final confirmation vote, but at that point it seems unlikely. Planned Parenthood activists confronted Collins on Capitol Hill ahead of the vote, but she voted to advance the nomination. 
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who was also on the fence, voted yes, as did Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (WV).*Follow along on our live blog as the vote proceeds.*
