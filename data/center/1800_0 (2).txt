WASHINGTON—A divided and cautious Supreme Court confronted the constitutional question of same-sex marriage, struggling with how to address a set of cases that could equalize the status of gay couples nationwide or reinforce divisions between states that disagree on such unions.Legal trends and public opinion have moved toward embracing same-sex marriage with remarkable speed, but Tuesday’s arguments didn’t indicate an outcome recognizing a right for gay unions was preordained. The court’s liberal justices challenged the rationale four states offered for denying marriage to gays and lesbians, while conservatives questioned why the court shouldn’t leave the question to popular will and legislative wisdom.     Justice Anthony Kennedy—author of the court’s three landmark opinions expanding gay rights since 1996 and likely the deciding vote—gave weight to both sides.                                         The Supreme Court will confront whether same-sex couples hold the same right to wed as heterosexuals. WSJ's Jess Bravin discusses the changing legal landscape.

And it’s very difficult for the court to say, ‘Oh well, we know better,’” he told Mary Bonauto, the lawyer representing 16 gay couples challenging marriage bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.               But Justice Kennedy also repeatedly questioned the legal justifications offered by the four states, suggesting they underestimated the role marriage plays in bestowing dignity on couples who wish to wed. He also was critical of a central argument made by the states that children would be better off if traditional definitions of marriage remain in place.     Ms. Bonauto characterized the gay-rights movement as a decadeslong struggle to overcome prejudice. Even the claim for same-sex marriage was nothing new, she said, noting the first case asserting it as a right reached the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago.     At the same time, she said, heterosexual marriage evolved. What once was a hierarchy “where a woman’s legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband” was now one of equality between spouses. Modern marriage, she said, “is a system in which committed, same-sex couples fit quite well.” She said the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection and due-process guarantees leave no justification for denying marital status to gay couples.     Justice Samuel Alito, sharply skeptical of Ms. Bonauto’s case, asked where the logic ended. Why should marriage be denied to polygamous spouses, he asked, observing that unlike same-sex marriage, polygamy has existed since antiquity.          Ms. Bonauto said multiple spouses would present more practical problems than would a couple. For instance, what “if there’s a divorce from the second wife, does that mean the fourth wife has access to the child of the second wife?”     The attorney representing the states, John Bursch, faced withering questions from the court’s liberal wing when he described marriage as a legal construct designed to keep heterosexual parents from shirking the duty to raise biological offspring, whether children were planned or not. Mr. Bursch said opening the institution to gay and lesbian couples who cannot procreate would undermine that benefit of marriage.     “How could that be?” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. “You’re not taking anything away from heterosexual couples. They would still have the very same incentive to marry, and all the benefits that come with marriage.”     Same-sex marriage would turn the institution into something that’s “all about emotion and commitment” between spouses rather than raising children, Mr. Bursch said. “If marriage and creating children don’t have anything to do with each other, then what do you expect? You expect more children outside of marriage,” he said.     “Why would that feeling, which doesn’t make any logical sense, control our decision making?” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, referring to the court’s eventual ruling.     Justice Kennedy took exception when Mr. Bursch said the reasons gay couples sought to marry—to legitimize love and commitment, and to dignify and solidify their families—were irrelevant to the state’s understanding of marriage. “The state doesn’t have any interest in that,” Mr. Bursch said.     “I thought that was the whole purpose of marriage. It bestows dignity on both man and woman in a traditional marriage,” Justice Kennedy said. “It’s dignity-bestowing, and these parties say they want to have that same ennoblement.”     Justice Kennedy added that the bar on same-sex marriage harmed children, by creating impediments to adoptions by gay couples and undermining the families of those who did have children. “You had some premise that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child. That was very interesting, but it’s just a wrong premise,” Justice Kennedy said.     Advocates for same-sex marriage were bolstered by the Obama administration, whose lawyer, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, likened the exclusion of same-sex couples to now-discredited laws barring interracial marriage.                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Verrilli rejected suggestions by some justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, that public-opinion trends would lead voters to extend gay marriage without court intervention. Unless the justices act, he said, America might be “a house divided” as it was during segregation. Some states would afford gay couples “equal dignity,” while others would relegate them to “demeaning, second-class status, and I don’t know why we would want to repeat that history,” he said.     Mr. Verrilli tied changes in public attitude to Justice Kennedy’s 2003 opinion invalidating sodomy laws. It was the catalyst that allowed gays and lesbians to “live openly” in society, he said, leading the heterosexual majority to recognize them as “full and equal members of the community.”      The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, released in March, showed support for gay marriage at an all-time high of 59%, nearly double the 30% support in 2004.     The outcome could be headed for a 5-4 split one way or another on the question of a national right to same-sex marriage, but the court also on Tuesday debated an incremental step that potentially could attract more justices: upholding state marriage restrictions while compelling states to recognize legal same-sex marriages from other states.                                                  Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage gather outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday as the justices hear arguments.

Mr. Whalen said if the court required such interstate recognition, “each state would be able to essentially legislate for every other state.”      Chief Justice Roberts said it was “quite rare” for a state to refuse to recognize an out-of-state marriage—even if another state had more permissive requirements in regard to age of consent or cousin relationships.      He said it may be “a big step” to find that the 14th Amendment requires all states to perform same sex marriages, but the idea of requiring states to recognize out-of-state marriages under “domestic relations law is pretty straightforward.”     A decision on both questions is expected before July.
