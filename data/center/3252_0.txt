Nikolas Cruz appeared in court on Monday.Students from the school have demanded action on gun control.It has emerged that Mr Cruz was able to buy seven rifles in the past year, despite being examined by Florida mental health workers in 2016, US media report.

What checks are currently in place?Federal licensed dealers must run checks on anyone trying to purchase a gun. A potential buyer fills in a form with personal information and criminal history. That information is submitted to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which processed more than 25 million applications last year. But the system has holes because it relies on state and federal officials to report any criminal convictions and mental health issues that should legally stop someone buying a gun to NICS.Its failings were put in the spotlight last year after the US Air Force admitted it had failed to flag a gunman's domestic violence conviction before he killed 26 people at a church in Texas. What changes are being proposed?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Demonstrators held a "lie-in" protest supporting gun control reform outside the White House on MondayAfter that shooting, a bipartisan bill was introduced by Mr Cornyn and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy.It would require federal agencies to report background information thoroughly and accurately. It also proposed offering states financial incentives to do the same through a penalty and reward system.At the time, Mr Cornyn presented it as a fix to a "nationwide, systematic problem". But the bill has not been passed by Congress.Media caption, Mr Obama told the BBC that gun control was his biggest frustrationOn Monday, Mr Murphy said the president's support for the bill was "another sign the politics of gun violence are shifting", but added that "no-one should pretend this bill alone is an adequate response to this epidemic".What does Trump think about gun control?Mr Trump's view on gun control has changed over time. He spoke out against gun control during the 2016 election race.Mr Trump has repeatedly emphasised the role of the shooter's mental health in the Florida attack, but last year he repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed certain people who receive mental health-related benefits to be entered into a criminal database.So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2018
