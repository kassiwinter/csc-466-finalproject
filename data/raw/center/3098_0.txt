Trump tweeted on Oct. 12, 2016.Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2016"Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us,” WikiLeaks wrote in a message to Trump Jr. on Oct. 12, 2016, including a link.“There’s many great stories the press are missing and we’re sure some of your follows [sic] will find it,” WikiLeaks continued. “Btw we just released Podesta Emails Part 4.”The report detailed how Trump engaged in private correspondence with the transparency site during the 2016 campaign, and that WikiLeaks made multiple requests of him.Trump Jr. confirmed he turned over the messages in three separate tweets where he linked the back and forth exchange with WikiLeaks.Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak. How ironic! 1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykA— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 14, 2017 Trump Jr.’s lawyers have given the messages to congressional investigators, according to The Atlantic report.WikiLeaks messaged Trump Jr. repeatedly, and many times did not receive a response.
