    Monday's shooting at the Navy Yard in Washington will resurrect the debate over gun-control policy, but isn't likely to bring lawmakers any closer to agreeing on new laws, top Democrats in both chambers said.     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said he hoped to return at some point to a measure to expand background checks to more gun sales that narrowly failed in the Senate in April, but that the political momentum had not yet changed.      "We are going to move this up as quick as we can, but we've got to have the votes for it and we don't have the votes," Mr. Reid told reporters Tuesday. "I hope to get them, but we don't have them now."     Democrats were blunt Tuesday that the latest shooting, which left 13 dead and eight wounded, stood little chance of overcoming the deep resistance among many lawmakers and their constituents to changing gun laws. In April a bipartisan Senate bill to expand background checks aimed at detecting buyers ineligible to own guns fell six votes short of the 60 it needed to advance.          Monday's shooting, which left 13 dead including the shooter, "will bring up debate; whether it will bring up action is problematic," House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D,. Md.) told reporters Tuesday. "If past is prologue, that prologue is not very helpful."     Although polls have shown that a majority of the public favors expanding background checks, recent elections haven't backed that up, said Mr. Hoyer. The second-ranking Democrat in the House pointed to last week's recall in Colorado, where voters booted out of office two state senators who had supported new laws that subjected private gun sales to background checks and banned magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.     "Eighty-five percent Americans say [expanding background checks] makes sense, but Colorado voters -- and this is what politicians see -- those 85% either didn't show up or they didn't vote what their response to polls is," Mr. Hoyer said. "Public opinion apparently does not manifest itself at the polls. What manifests itself at the polls are the hard-line groups that energize their single-issue supporters to vote."     Some Democratic senators dismissed the Colorado recall as an example of local politics that couldn't be extrapolated onto a national arena.     "It's difficult to draw too many conclusions from that race," said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has pushed for stronger gun-control laws since the December 2012 massacre of elementary-school children in Newtown, Conn. Every shooting strengthens public support for new laws designed to minimize gun violence, he said.     But this week's shooting appeared to do little to alter the stance of Senate Democrats who had opposed the measure. Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska said he thought Monday's massacre underscored the need to focus instead on overhauling the mental-health system.     "The issue that that gentleman had was mental health issues," Mr. Begich said Tuesday. "That's what we should be doing."     Mr. Reid said he would be willing to bring up mental-health legislation to the Senate floor, even if it meant splitting it apart from the other gun-control measures that had initially accompanied it.     "That's something we will look at," Mr. Reid said.     Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com        Copyright Â©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
