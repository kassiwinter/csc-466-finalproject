                                                  The family of Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said he will end medical treatment for brain cancer.

John McCain    will discontinue treatment for brain cancer, his family said in a statement on Friday, adding the progress of the disease and his advancing age will “render their verdict.”     Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican and 2008 GOP presidential candidate, has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments in his home state since he announced in the summer of 2017 that he had been diagnosed with glioblastoma.      “With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment,” his family said in an unsigned statement released through his Senate office. “John has surpassed expectations for his survival.”     Glioblastomas are the most common form of primary brain cancers and advance extremely quickly, according to neurologists. Standard treatment includes surgery and a combination of radiation and chemotherapy. Surgery alone isn’t enough because of the way glioblastomas spread.               “Our family is immensely grateful for the support and kindness of all his caregivers over the last year, and for the continuing outpouring of concern and affection from John’s many friends and associates, and the many thousands of people who are keeping him in their prayers. God bless and thank you all,” the statement added.     The treatments have left him weakened and unable to be in Washington for Senate business.           In what was seen as a farewell speech on the Senate floor in July 2017, Mr. McCain told his colleagues: “It’s a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it.... I’ve had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else. I appreciate it though, every word, even if much of it isn’t deserved.“     He cast his last vote in the Senate on Dec. 7, leaving Republicans with only the thinnest of majorities over the Democrats—50 to 49—in the chamber.                                         Sen. Lindsey Graham said he spoke with Sen. John McCain after the Arizona senator was diagnosed with a type of brain cancer known as a glioblastoma.

The two men have had a difficult political relationship. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump famously criticized Mr. McCain, who served five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. “I like people who weren’t captured,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. McCain was no war hero.     In July 2017, Mr. McCain cast a dramatic late-night vote against a Senate measure to pare back selected pieces of the 2010 Obama health-care law, joining two other Republicans to sink the bill. Mr. Trump has repeatedly referenced Mr. McCain’s “no” vote as the reason the measure failed.     Mr. McCain recently criticized Mr. Trump for his appearance alongside Russian President      Vladimir Putin,        calling their meeting and joint press conference last month “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.”     Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
