Federal workers braced for missing their first paycheck this week as negotiators showed little sign of progress in ending a two-week-old partial government shutdown. White House officials and congressional leadership staff members met Saturday and Sunday but didn’t agree on allocating money for President         Trump’s    request for hundreds of miles of a wall along the southern U.S. border. Mr. Trump also reiterated his suggestion, first made late last week, that he was considering declaring a national emergency if Congress didn’t agree to fund the wall, an action that would invite legal challenges.        
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOUHow is the partial government shutdown affecting you? Tell us your story.        Meanwhile, the shutdown’s impact stretched across the country as federal workers began tightening their belts and tourists found locked doors at museums. The National Park Service said Sunday that it would use entrance fees, usually reserved for future projects, to clean trash, maintain restrooms and increase law enforcement in accessible areas.     Because of the partial shutdown, about 420,000 employees, deemed essential, are working without pay, while 380,000 federal employees have been placed on unpaid leave, or furlough.         Mick Mulvaney,    the acting White House chief of staff, said in remarks on NBC that aired Sunday that if lawmakers don’t reach an agreement by midnight on Tuesday, federal employees would miss their first full paycheck on Friday.                                         President Trump and prominent Democrats met Friday to discuss ending the government shutdown, which the president had claimed responsibility to further the cause border security. The talks were described by the president as productive, but the Democrats disagreed.

Two Democratic aides said Sunday that an afternoon meeting was delayed by 45 minutes because Republicans weren’t ready with documents to explain why that $5.7 billion amount was needed for the wall. The administration eventually provided a list of proposals including $5.7 billion for “234 miles of new physical barrier” along the border and requested money for more law enforcement, more immigration judges and more beds in border-detention facilities, according to a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal.           The letter, from Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, focused on a “steel barrier” rather than a concrete wall that Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised.      Mr. Trump in a Sunday tweet said the meeting, which he didn’t attend, had been productive. He also himself emphasized he would accept a steel barrier, rather than a concrete wall, and said he planned to call         U.S. Steel    and other companies to work on the design.     “We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive,” the president said on Twitter.     Democrats have supported repairing existing barriers but have opposed creating a new one along the border. A spending bill passed by the House on Thursday for Homeland Security included money to repair fences along the border as well as for bollard barriers, levees and technology improvements.     As to whether steel fencing proposed by the president would be considered as a compromise, House Majority Leader         Steny Hoyer    (D., Md.) said Sunday on NBC that the move away from a concrete wall is “an offer he made, and it’ll be discussed.”     House Democrats this coming week plan to start passing individual spending bills to reopen government agencies, starting with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, which now lacks funding and wouldn’t be able to process tax-refund checks if the shutdown continues at length. Those bills aren’t likely to be taken up in the Senate, though some GOP senators have indicated they may want Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to break with the president.

We need to look at more border patrol agents, technology, and other means as well,” Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press.”     The shutdown, now in its third week, became tied for the second-longest on record Sunday. The longest shutdown in U.S. history under current rules lasted 21 days and started in 1995.     For tourists, the partial shutdown began having a bigger effect in recent days after the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo closed last week.

Ivor Sachs, a 73-year old retired sales executive from Seattle, in recent days visited the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif., only to find parts of the museum shut. He then traveled to the Joshua Tree National Park in the California desert, where rangers were off duty due to the shutdown.      “I didn’t want to risk it; if my car broke down, who are you going to call?” he said.     For federal workers, the bite is even tougher. Robert Sudar, 36, a market analyst at the Office of Natural Resources in Denver, started driving Uber to supplement income while he is furloughed.      “The last few nights, I’ve been out driving,” he said. “We’re not going to go out to eat; we’ll have sandwiches at home.”
