                                                  On his visit to Kenya in 2006, Mr. Obama toured the northeastern district of Wajir on the country's arid frontier with Somalia and Ethiopia.

Mr. Obama will visit the east African nation in July for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit. The event brings together business leaders, non-governmental organization workers and government officials and is being hosted in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time.      The trip will "continue our efforts to work with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Monday.     The president last visited Kenya in 2006 when he was in the Senate, but so far hasn't visited there during his time as president.          Mr. Obama's father Barack Obama Sr. was a Kenyan-born economist. He studied at both the University of Hawaii and Harvard University before returning to Kenya in the mid-1960s. It was in Hawaii where the elder Mr. Obama met and married the future president's mother Stanley Ann Dunham. The president's father was killed in an automobile accident in 1982 at age 46.     In 2013, the president's trip to Tanzania, South Africa and Senegal -- but not Kenya -- was widely perceived in his ancestral homeland as an insult. Just two years earlier, Mr. Obama celebrated his Irish heritage in a visit to that country.     "Obama's snub has left me with a foul taste in the mouth. It verges on snobbishness," a Kenyan wrote in a letter to one of the country's top newspapers.     But that year, White House officials expressed concern about Kenya's recent elections and the fact that President Uhuru Kenyatta was being tried for human rights violations in the International Criminal Court.     A presidential visit two years ago was deemed too sensitive "given the fact that Kenya is in the aftermath of their election and the new government has come into place and is going to be reviewing these issues with the ICC and the international community," a White House official told NPR in 2013.     Asked in a town hall meeting in 2013 about his apparent reticence to visit while president, Mr. Obama vowed he would do so before the end of his term.     "If in three years and seven months I am not in Kenya, then you can fault me for not following through on my promise," he said at the time.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
