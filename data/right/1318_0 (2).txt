                                                                                                                                         Israel reported at least 30 more killed in Gaza, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered shelling against Hamas to resume and doubled down on claims that the Jewish nation would not stop defending itself against terror group Hamas, no matter the pressures of the international community.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Netanyahu specifically said Israeli military wouldn’t stop its fight against Hamas, even after troops rooted out and destroyed all the tunnels the terror group had dug, Reuters reported.                                                                                                                                                      Shortly after, Israeli rocket attacks killed at least 30 more in Gaza — and a delegation of Palestinians headed back to Cairo for more cease-fire talks, Reuters reported. So far, previous peace talks have proven futile. One sticking point: Hamas wants the total destruction of the Jewish nation.                                                                                                                                                         Among the main points of “The Covenant of the Hamas,” issued in 1988, is an excerpt that states: “On the destruction of Israel: Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it,” the Federation of American Scientists reported.
