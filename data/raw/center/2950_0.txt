One of the staffers shouted “don’t look.”A couple of minutes later, Trump, with his glasses back on, turned his head upward and watched the eclipse for around a minute and a half as the eclipse reached its apex. When a reporter asked him "how's the view," the president gestured back with a thumbs up. The president was joined by a number of top officials, including Attorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsWhite House unveils team for SCOTUS pick Press: For Trump endorsement: The more sordid, the better Those predicting Facebook's demise are blowing smoke MORE, Commerce Secretary Wilbur RossWilbur Louis RossMomentum builds to prohibit lawmakers from trading stocks Census memo notes 'unprecedented' Trump administration meddling: report Holding defiant Trump witnesses to account, Jan. 6 committee carries out Congress's constitutional role MORE, trade representative Robert LighthizerBob LighthizerBiden moves to undo Trump trade legacy with EU deal Whiskey, workers and friends caught in the trade dispute crossfire GOP senator warns quick vote on new NAFTA would be 'huge mistake' MORE, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, communications director Hope Hicks and daughter Ivanka Trump.On Twitter, all anyone wanted to do for a few moments was talk about Trump looking directly into the eclipse without protective glasses.He did it. pic.twitter.com/a7tHOcyEVy— Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) August 21, 2017WASHINGTON, August 21, 2017 -- President Donald Trump looks directly into the solar eclipse. pic.twitter.com/UedUycAO4o— Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) August 21, 2017No glasses?
