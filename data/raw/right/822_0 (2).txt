                                                                                                                                         For a few weeks in 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann was on top of the GOP,  having chased Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty from the GOP presidential  field and racing to the front of the pack.                                                                                                                                                      But Mrs. Bachmann eventually came crashing back down to earth and on  Wednesday she announced that she would not seek re-election to Congress — ending an astonishing political career that captured the roiling  politics of the last four years.                                                                                                                                                      “I think it is a mistake to see her as simply a kind of fleeting  figure,” said Larry Jacobs, political science professor at the  University of Minnesota. “She reflects an era and a kind of moment in  American politics that shows the tensions with the Republican Party  between Liberty Republicans and more establishment Republicans willing  to compromise.                                                                                                                                                                    “It also shows the limits and the inability of the tea party to find a  popular platform that could win majorities, and that is what happened  to Michelle Bachmann.”                                                                                                                              Mrs. Bachmann announced her decision via an eight-minute video on her  campaign website, saying she wasn’t swayed by polls showing her in a  tight re-match race in 2014 against Democrat Jim Graves, who she  narrowly defeated just six months ago.                                                                                                                                                                 “I have every confidence that if I ran, I would again defeat the  individual who I defeated last year, who recently announced he is once  again running,” she said in her video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Tea Party Express, which bills itself as the nation’s largest tea  party political action committee, praised Mrs. Bachmann, 57, as “strong advocate” for the grass-roots movement’s push for “fiscal  responsibility and limited government.”                                                                                                                              The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, meanwhile, said that  the “Tea Party brand of extremism and obstruction have infected the  entire Republican Congress, and her influence shows no signs of waning.”                                                                                                                              A proud social conservative, Mrs. Bachmann made an immediate splash  in the GOP presidential race by winning the Iowa straw poll in the  summer of 2011, boosting her as the conservative alternative to former  Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.                                                                                                                   Six months later, though, voters had turned. She placed sixth in the  Iowa caucuses and dropped out of the race with her campaign more than $1 million in debt.                                                                                                                 “Electability is always an important issue to caucusgoers in both  parties and she had difficulty passing that threshold,” said David  Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern  Illinois.                      Mrs. Bachmann instead ran for her House seat again, winning  re-election but keeping a lower profile on Capitol Hill, where she has  been dogged by investigations into whether her presidential campaign  violated finance laws.                      But in recent days she had shown signs of getting her grove back.  Last month, she revived the House Tea Party Caucus, and she also led a  news conference this month protesting the IRS’s treatment of  conservative groups — an event that drew Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell, Kentucky Republican.                      That same day she also saw the House pass her bill to repeal “Obamacare,” and had begun running campaign ads touting the vote.                      Mr. Jacobs said that the timing of Mrs. Bachmann’s announcement  suggests there could be more bad news to come for the congresswoman.                      “There was every sign of a Bachmann revival effort and to all of a  sudden pull the plug on running re-election after putting in the time  and money and making the political commitment, tells me that there is  another shoe to drop,” Mr. Jacobs said.                      William McGinley, the lawyer representing Mrs. Bachmann, has said that she will be cleared of any wrongdoing.                      Mrs. Bachmann also addressed the allegations in her announcement,  saying “this decision was not impacted in any way the recent inquiries  into the activities of my former presidential campaign, or my former  presidential staff.”
