Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Sunday that the budget blueprint he plans to unveil later this week will promote repealing President Obama's signature health care law."Yes, our budget does promote repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a better system," Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday."Past House Republican efforts to repeal the president's health care law have failed and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of law last year.On Thursday, Ryan lunched at the White House with Obama and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Ryan said Sunday that only time will tell how effective the president's recent outreach to him and other congressional Republicans will be."The proof will be in the coming weeks as to whether or not it is a real sincere outreach to find common ground," Ryan said.
