His liberal critics insisted this would lead to catastrophe that never came, and on Thursday it delivered a diplomatic achievement: The United Arab Emirates and Israel agreed to normalize relations, making the UAE the first Arab League country to recognize the Jewish state in 20 years.      The agreement is worth celebrating on its own terms but it also holds lessons for U.S. foreign policy. On regional strategy, this shows the benefit of the U.S. standing by its historic allies in the Middle East. President         Obama    shunned Israel and the Gulf states and sought to normalize Iran. His nuclear deal, an economic boon to Tehran, was a means to that end. But Iran does not want to be normalized. It’s a revolutionary regime that wants to disrupt the non-Shiite countries, spread its military influence from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen, and destroy Israel.      Mr. Trump’s pivot from Iran reassured Israel and the Gulf states and put the U.S. in a position to broker agreements. Israel and the UAE have worked together covertly, but the agreement will allow deeper economic ties and strengthen regional checks on Iranian power. UAE’s move could also spur Bahrain and possibly Oman to seek the benefits, in Jerusalem and Washington, from closer Israel ties. For decades Israel was treated as a pariah state in the Middle East, but that era may be ending.     As for the Israel-Palestine question, as part of the deal Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    agreed to call off annexation of parts of the West Bank. Public support in Israel for annexation was shaky. It was also opposed by the military establishment and would have carried diplomatic costs. With the UAE deal, Mr. Netanyahu can avoid annexation while protecting against criticism from his right.               The UAE can say it blocked annexation and protected the Palestinian cause. But the fact that annexation was a bargaining chip at all shows how the balance of power in the Israel-Palestine conflict has shifted in Israel’s favor. Arab states would previously have demanded far greater concessions in exchange for recognition. But the Iran threat, plus the Palestinians’ long-running rejectionism, has made that issue less important to Arab states.     Recall that mandarins of Obama foreign policy said moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem would cause an Arab backlash. In fact, it is being followed by some of the closest Arab-U.S.-Israeli cooperation on record. Larger strategic realities in the Middle East are more important and are driving this change.      One question is whether a Joe Biden Administration would grasp this, or whether it would follow the Obama model of retrenchment against Iran plus browbeating Israelis for their supposed moral failings. The         Biden    campaign praised the deal while         Ben Rhodes,    an architect of Obama Administration policy, blasted it for “the total exclusion of Palestinians.”     Yet the coterie of anti-Israel and Iran-friendly Democratic foreign-policy hands may soon find their influence reduced. The UAE deal strengthens the anti-Iran coalition and withdraws an excuse—annexation—that the left could use to attack Israel. Whoever wins in November, the breakthrough leaves the U.S. in a better position in the Middle East.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
