                                                  Former presidential candidate Tom Steyer spoke at his Get Out the Vote rally in Columbia, S.C., on Friday, the day before the Democratic primary.

He added that he would support whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee.     Mr. Steyer, 62 years old, has never held political office and began his long-shot campaign in July, launching a well-funded barrage of advertising calling President         Trump    unfit for office and sounding the alarm on climate change.               But in November, an even wealthier billionaire entered the race and began outspending him. Former New York Mayor         Michael Bloomberg    had spent more than double Mr. Steyer’s campaign investment by the end of January.     Mr. Steyer largely ignored the first few primary states and staked his candidacy on South Carolina, where he concentrated most of his time and won the backing of several prominent African-American local lawmakers. He spent about $22 million on TV and radio ads in the state—more than eight times as much as the next-highest spender, according to ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Mr. Bloomberg has focused on states that vote in March.     Nationally, Mr. Steyer’s campaign also spent much more than all of the Democrats in the race except for Mr. Bloomberg, Federal Election Commission reports show.     But all that money wasn’t enough to help him break through. He averaged about 2.5% in national polls in late February, RealClear Politics shows.     In the decade before he became a presidential candidate, Mr. Steyer’s generous spending on political candidates and groups supporting stricter environmental policies and his efforts to increase youth voter turnout made him one of the Democratic Party’s top donors.     Those efforts and a self-financed TV campaign advocating the impeachment of Mr. Trump added up to about $350 million over the years, The Wall Street Journal found.     —Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article.
