An arduous recount process began Sunday in Florida as both sides of a close U.S. Senate race launched legal actions and the state again commanded national attention over an election controversy. The recount of the state’s Senate and governor’s races began in many counties on Sunday, and dozens of others will begin recounting on Monday or Tuesday. Technical problems with voting machines in Broward County, a focal point of dispute, delayed the beginning of the recount there by several hours. Meanwhile, election officials in Palm Beach County said they would be pressed to meet the Thursday deadline for a machine recount. The contested Florida races, which have drawn widespread comparison to the 2000 Bush-Gore presidential election, are among several races still unresolved days after Election Day. In Arizona, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema appears on track to winning a Senate seat after early results showed Republican         Martha McSally    ahead. Ms. Sinema now leads Ms. McSally by roughly 28,000 votes, or one percentage point, while election officials continue to tabulate results. Several House races in California also remain uncalled. Democrats are assured of taking control of the House, while Republicans will maintain control of the Senate, when the new Congress takes over in January.     On Sunday, Florida’s Republican         Gov. Rick Scott,    who has declared himself the winner in the Senate race over incumbent Democrat         Bill Nelson    yet has seen his lead diminish, faced calls to recuse himself from any oversight after he filed lawsuits and called on state law enforcement to investigate any wrongdoing. Groups such as the League of Women Voters also have threatened legal action against the governor, whose campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.               “He has a self-interest” in the election, Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) said on CNN. “He should be out of it all together.”     Mr. Scott’s campaign on Sunday afternoon filed three new lawsuits, including one that seeks to invalidate any votes counted in Broward County, a Democratic stronghold, after a Saturday deadline that all counties faced to send unofficial results to the state. It wasn’t immediately known how many votes were potentially affected. The other two court motions called for preserving voting machines and ballots used in recounts in Broward and Palm Beach counties.     Mr. Scott and other Republicans, including President Trump, have leveled charges of fraud as the votes continue to be counted, but state election and law-enforcement officials say there has been no evidence of illegal activity. Mr. Nelson, who is seeking his fourth term, never officially conceded and has brought on a legal team to pursue the recount.     Mr. Scott’s lead has steadily dropped to 12,562 votes, or 0.15 percentage point, from roughly 56,000 votes on election night. The gubernatorial race between Republican         Ron DeSantis    and Democrat         Andrew Gillum    is also subject to a recount, with Mr. DeSantis leading by roughly 33,000 votes, or 0.41 percentage point. The race for state agriculture commissioner is also being recounted.     Under Florida law, local election officials will have until 3 p.m. Thursday to conduct a machine recount for the races within a half percentage point. If the margin of victory is less than a quarter point after the machine recount, a race proceeds to a manual recount. If necessary, election officials will have until noon on Nov. 18 to complete a manual recount.     The process in Broward Country has drawn the most ire from Republicans. Elections supervisor Brenda Snipes, whose office has come under legal scrutiny in the past, has said little during the process other than attributing the delays to heavy turnout. While there is no evidence of wrongdoing at the Broward election site, delays have plagued its operations at several steps of the counting process.     “They still haven’t commenced counting, and we don’t know when they will,” Tim Cerio, a lawyer for Mr. Scott, said Sunday of the recount in the county. Election officials there are sorting through ballots via machine and will begin formally recounting them later this week.     Mr. Gillum had conceded his contest on election night when his deficit was wider than it is now, but he officially withdrew that concession Saturday. He appeared Sunday at a packed African-American church in Fort Lauderdale and reiterated concerns about mail-in and provisional ballots being rejected because an election worker determined the signature didn’t match.                                                 Supporters of Florida’s two gubernatorial candidates met face-to-face outside the Broward elections office on Saturday.

As Florida begins its recount processes, a legal challenge filed by the Nelson campaign and the Florida Democratic Party will continue to work its way through the federal courts. A federal judge set a date for Wednesday to hear arguments about the complaint, which charges that Florida’s system for verifying signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots is unconstitutional and could leave tens of thousands of votes uncounted.     The suit argues that the large number of mail-in ballots rejected in previous elections—roughly 1% in 2012 and 2016, according to the suit—underlines the arbitrary nature of the signature-matching process. It also cites an academic study from a University of Florida political-science professor showing that mail-in ballots from young and minority voters were rejected at higher rates.     Marc Elias, an elections lawyer working for the Nelson campaign, is bullish that the Democrat will win after the process moves to a hand recount. He said that a number of outstanding “undervotes”—ballots in which voters didn’t clearly mark their preference in the Senate race—will ultimately be determined to be votes for Mr. Nelson. He also said the campaign is monitoring the possibility that mail-in ballots weren’t counted because they were delayed in the mail.     On Sunday, officials in Miami-Dade County received 266 ballots that were found at a postal facility. Those votes won’t be counted but could become part of continued legal action surrounding the recount.     Last week, Republicans filed public-records lawsuits in Broward and Palm Beach counties requesting additional information about outstanding ballots and the vote count. Judges sided with the GOP in both suits, ordering the election officials to provide them with the requested information.
