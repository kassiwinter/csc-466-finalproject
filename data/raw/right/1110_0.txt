                                                  The Washington Times - January 10, 2013, 10:29AM                                                               	President Obama took more fire from the left Thursday over what critics say is a lack of diversity in his second-term Cabinet appointments.                                                          “It’s embarrassing as hell,” said Rep. Charles B. Rangel, New York Democrat, on MSNBC’s “Jansing & Co.”                                                       SEE RELATED:                                                             As the president gears up for his second term, Mr. Obama’s first four appointments   have been white men: Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts to replace   Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, former Sen. Chuck Hagel to   serve as defense secretary; counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to   head the CIA and White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to take over as Treasury secretary.                                                          With the surprise departure Wednesday of Labor   Secretary Hilda L. Solis, some liberals are reminding Mr. Obama that he   criticized Republican Mitt Romney during the presidential campaign for  saying he once consulted “binders of women” to find qualified female  aides.                                                          “We’ve been through this with Mitt Romney,” Mr. Rangel said. Mr. Obama “has had four years to work the bench, to know the second team, so that in the second term these people should be just as  experienced as any other American. You have to [appoint women and  minorities] because it’s the right thing to do as a symbol of what  America stands for — and that’s whether you’re Republican or Democrat.”                                                          White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president’s record on  diversity “speaks for itself,” and he pointed to Mr. Obama’s appointment of  two female Supreme Court justices, among other nominations and  hirings.
