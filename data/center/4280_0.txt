Iran said it would exceed limits on its enriched-uranium stockpiles before the end of this month, as the U.S. said it would send an additional 1,000 troops to the Mideast in response to “hostile behavior” by Tehran.Iran’s threat on Monday came days after the U.S. accused Tehran of orchestrating a second set of attacks on oil tankers near a vital global-shipping route. If carried out, Iran would violate the 2015 nuclear deal by breaching the pact’s enriched-uranium cap. That could jeopardize European efforts to save an accord that President Trump pulled out of last year. Iranian officials framed their nuclear-enrichment threat as an ultimatum to Europe, which has furiously tried to save the deal by finding ways around U.S. sanctions that have cut off trade with Iran and tipped its economy into a deep recession.     Mr. Trump tweeted, “Iran to defy Uranium Stockpile Limits” but made no further comment. National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said, “President Trump has made it clear that he will never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. The regime’s nuclear blackmail must be met with increased international pressure.”           U.S. military officials said the additional troops will help provide security and intelligence in the region amid heightened tensions over a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Washington has blamed Iran for the attacks. Tehran has denied any involvement.      The U.S. already has more than 20,000 troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Last month the Pentagon deployed an aircraft carrier, other warships, bombers and additional forces to counter what officials said was a growing threat from Iran. Officials declined to say where or when the new troops would be deployed.     U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Tampa, Fla., for Tuesday meetings with Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, and Gen. Richard Clarke, who heads U.S. special operations forces.      Iran warned in early May it would withdraw from parts of the nuclear deal, which was meant to open Iran’s economy in exchange for limits on its atomic ambitions. But its Monday announcement after two fuel tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday ratcheted up pressure on the U.S. and Europe to respond.      European officials criticized Iran’s announcement but said they wouldn’t take any immediate action. A British government spokesman said France, Germany and the U.K. have “consistently made clear that there can be no reduction in compliance…We are coordinating with…partners on next steps.”      European leaders warned that their efforts to save the deal would be complicated if Iran was behind the tanker assaults.     The military significance of Tehran’s move would depend on how far Iran goes in exceeding the cap on low enriched uranium set by the 2015 accord and whether the Iranians also install additional centrifuges to process that material, said Gary Samore, a Brandeis University professor who served as former President Obama’s adviser on weapons of mass destruction.      Iran removed two-thirds of its centrifuges following the nuclear deal but has stored them under watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency.     “If they exceed the cap by just a few thousand kilograms, then it is insignificant,” Mr. Samore said. “But if they go much further and install thousands of additional centrifuges, it would reduce the time Iran would need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon.”     The spokesman for Iran’s atomic energy agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said that by June 27—10 days from Monday—the country would surpass its enriched-uranium limits. He said Iran would further increase its production in early July, but could reverse both steps if Europe provided relief from sanctions.     “Today, the countdown starts from 10,” Mr. Kamalvandi said.                                         The Trump administration’s unsteady rhetoric towards Iran continues. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explores what’s behind the conflicting messages.

However under the pact, any move away from full compliance requires agreement of the accord’s remaining parties.     Mr. Pompeo sought over the weekend to build international support for Washington’s allegation. The Pentagon released on Monday additional photos that officials said show Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, was responsible for damaging two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. The military earlier released video purporting to show IRGC personnel removing an unexploded mine from the side of one of the tankers.      At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg, diplomats called for an independent international probe into the attacks and urged caution by all sides.      Newsletter Sign-up Notes on the News Today’s headlines, news in context, and good reads you may have missed.      Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, who visited Tehran last week, said Germany was still looking at evidence on whether Iran was responsible and said time was needed to establish the facts.     The U.S. recently stepped up its military presence in the region in response to what the U.S. military said are new Iranian threats. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, an Iranian-allied force, have stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi infrastructure, including airports and oil pipelines.     Iran’s chief of armed staff, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, on Monday denied Iranian responsibility for the recent tanker attacks, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported. He said that if Iran wanted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, it would do so unmistakably. “We are brave enough to take the responsibility of our own actions, shout it out loud with heads high up and accept its consequences too,” Gen. Bagheri said.     European countries have been cautious about blaming Iran for attacking the tankers. On Monday, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said that Washington risked heading for a repeat of the leadup to the Iraq war in 2003 when the U.S. presented evidence based on faulty intelligence.     Others, however, warned that if Iran was found to be responsible for last week’s attacks, it would force them to reconsider their approach to Iran, raise questions about sanctions and complicate efforts to keep the nuclear deal afloat. “Of course this is made more difficult” in that case, Mr. Maas said.     The quickly evolving circumstances pose an urgent challenge for the Europeans, who haven’t articulated—or agreed among themselves—what actions Iran could take that would cause them to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.        
Related        Many European officials blame Mr. Trump’s pullout from the nuclear deal and the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions for Iran’s reciprocal moves. They warned at the time it would lead Tehran to scale up what they said were its malign regional actions and possibly revive its nuclear program.     European officials have warned Iran privately and publicly not to use the nuclear deal limits as pressure points. Still, diplomats say the bloc might not reimpose sanctions on Iran unless there were significant, systematic breaches of the deal.     The EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Monday the EU wouldn’t react to Iranian announcements but to facts that the United Nations atomic agency presents on Iran’s actions. The next IAEA report on Iran is scheduled for late August.     “I would not elaborate on what happens if and when” Iran breaches the accord, Ms. Mogherini said. “As of today, Iran is still compliant and we strongly hope, encourage, expect Iran continues to comply with its commitments in full.”     The U.N. atomic agency said on June 10 that Iran had stepped up its production of low-enriched uranium and Iranian officials said Monday it has since been further increased. Under the deal, Iran faced a 300 kilogram cap on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium in the hexaflouride form, the gas which is fed into centrifuges.      That is equivalent to 202.8 kilograms in a purer chemical form that the IAEA measures. The agency said Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile in this purer form was 174.1 kilograms as of May 20.     Iranian officials said in early May they could quickly move to enrich uranium at 20% again after 60 days. If they followed through, that could be a second breach of the 2015 agreement after exceeding the cap on enriched-uranium stockpiles. Once uranium is being enriched at this purity, it is relatively easy to start producing weapons-grade uranium. Iran has also said it would disregard the cap on its stockpile of heavy water, which can also be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon.      Iran was producing low enriched uranium at a rate of around 12 kilograms a month, the IAEA told member states 10 days ago. It is possible for Iran to increase the production pace based on the currently installed centrifuges, a European official said. However they were doubtful Iran could quickly scale up its uranium production much further without risk of damage to its centrifuges. At its 12 kilogram rate of uranium production, Iran would likely have hit the stockpile limit in early August.
