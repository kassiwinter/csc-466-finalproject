A federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President      Donald Trump’s        executive order on immigration and refugees, a decision that applies nationwide to tens of thousands of people holding visas to travel to the U.S.While previous court orders addressed the plight of detained travelers, U.S. District Judge         James Robart’s    more-sweeping ruling stops the executive order entirely. A week ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—for at least 90 days, calling it a needed move to keep terrorists from entering the U.S. It also froze the entire U.S. refugee program for four months, barred Syrians from entering as refugees indefinitely and cut the number of refugees the U.S. will accept in fiscal year 2017 to 50,000, less than half the number that former President         Barack Obama    called for this year.     Judge Robart, in his seven-page ruling, wrote that he granted the restraining order, in part, because the plaintiffs were likely to win on their constitutional claims. Not halting the president’s executive order immediately would cause the plaintiffs “irreparable injury,” the judge wrote.

The suit that led to Judge Robart’s ruling was filed by the state of Washington. The state’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, said, “What the judge announced today is nationwide—the president’s executive order does not apply.”     Airlines including Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa AG responded to the ruling Saturday, saying all passengers with valid travel documents including from the seven countries included in the ban would be allowed to travel to the U.S.      How immigration officials throughout the country will handle the judge’s temporary halt of Mr. Trump’s order wasn’t immediately clear.      White House spokesman         Sean Spicer    said in a statement that the Justice Department “intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the president, which we believe is lawful and appropriate.” An earlier version of his statement, released by the White House, called the order “outrageous.” On Saturday, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal to the Seattle court’s ruling.     District judges don’t often issue nationwide injunctions, but they have happened in recent years in high-profile cases.     A federal judge in Los Angeles in 2010 issued a nationwide injunction against the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which banned openly gay men and women from serving in the military. And in 2015, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction blocking the implementation of Obama administration policies that granted some protection to children of illegal immigrants.      But with such orders come a host of legal caveats and possible complications. Judges in other districts are free to make and implement rulings that go against nationwide orders, according to legal experts. And nationwide orders are often put on temporary hold by appeals courts, to stave off uncertainty that might otherwise ensue.     Immigration lawyers said the ruling was sweeping and, at least for now, was being taken to mean that refugees and people from the seven banned countries could once again enter the U.S.      “We’re interpreting this ruling as saying the executive order is invalidated,” said Diane Butler, an immigration lawyer who was in the courtroom in Seattle when the ruling was given and sits on the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.      In practical terms, however, the ruling was unlikely to have immediate impact for a large number of immigrants, refugees and visa-holders, immigrant-rights activists and lawyers said. Many were still trying to figure out exactly how the judge’s order might be implemented.     U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would need to receive the order and update its protocols. That, as well as alerting embassy offices around the world, could take time, especially on a weekend, experts said.     However, Ms. Butler said the State Department should now be able to re-validate the tens of thousands of visas it revoked this week.      Immigration lawyers expected the ruling to be appealed by the Justice Department. But meanwhile, Ms. Butler said lawyers were advising their clients—both refugees and those hailing from the banned countries—to once again attempt to enter the U.S. if they could.      “We’re trying to get the word out to our clients to arrive with a smile on their face and present themselves as if they are entitled to be here,” she said.      Judge Robart’s ruling capped a hectic day of court hearings around the country as individuals, civil-rights groups and state officials sought to strike down the executive order.     At a hearing in federal court in Virginia, a Justice Department lawyer said the order had led to the revocation of more than 100,000 visas—a statement that was quickly contradicted by the State Department, which said the correct figure was fewer than 60,000.     A small percentage of those people, who were already in transit to the U.S. when the new rule went into effect, were detained at U.S. airports.     U.S. District Judge         Leonie Brinkema,    who presided over the trial of Sept. 11 plotter         Zacarias Moussaoui,    indicated she was surprised by the public response to the travel-ban case.     “This order touched something in the U.S. that I’ve never seen before,” Judge Brinkema said while presiding over the Virginia hearing. “People are quite upset.”     The judge also said it appeared there hadn’t been enough thought put into the order before it was issued, resulting in “chaos.’’     The judge allowed lawyers for the state of Virginia to join the lawsuit challenging the executive order, one of a number of cases filed by people who had legal approval to enter the U.S. but were nevertheless detained at airports once they arrived.     The detentions sparked large protests at airports at major American cities, particularly over the plight of legal permanent residents, commonly called green-card holders, who were initially barred entry to the U.S. Officials have since said that green-card holders can return to the U.S. and that no green-card holders are still being detained.     Also Friday, a federal judge in Boston sided with the Trump administration and said he wouldn’t continue a temporary restraining order he had issued last week. The ruling by U.S. District Judge         Nathaniel Gorton    isn’t likely to have any immediate legal effect because court orders from other judges remain in effect.     —Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.
