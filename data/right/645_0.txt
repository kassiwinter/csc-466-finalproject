                                                                      Photo:            Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg News                                                                                                                   U.S. stocks capped their worst week since 2008 Friday amid fears that the coronavirus will become a pandemic. Though markets rallied Monday on expectations that central banks will slash interest rates, the Nasdaq was still down nearly 9% from its record close of 9817.18 on Feb. 19.      Nasdaq Inc. saw record messages and volumes last week. Nasdaq options markets registered an all-time peak of 62 billion messages on Friday, far above its daily average of about 18 billion over the past year. Similarly, Nasdaq U.S. equities volumes this week reached 2.74 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 1.39 billion over the last year. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, more than tripled last week, reaching the highest level of volatility since the 2008-09 financial crisis.          Is this reason to panic? Not necessarily. Markets have historically been quick to recover from pandemic threats. Since the 1994 pneumonic plague, at least 10 other significant health events—among them SARS, avian flu and Zika—have rattled global markets, and in eight of those cases, stocks had climbed more than 10% after 12 months, once investors had properly gauged the threat. More broadly, there have been 26 market corrections of at least 13% since 1946. It has taken only around four months on average for markets to recover to precorrection levels.     But markets aren’t merely resilient to public-health crises—they’re also a major means by which such emergencies are resolved. Capital is part of the cure. Markets respond to new information during shocks, efficiently allocating capital and allowing investors to express their thinking in real time. Investors are flocking to drugmaker         Gilead Sciences,    which amid the coronavirus epidemic has been expanding clinical trials of remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to combat Ebola.               Over the past five years, 426 new health-care and biotechnology companies have had initial public offerings on the Nasdaq, and together they’ve raised more than $40 billion, with an average return to investors of 23% in their first year. One of them,         Moderna Inc.,    announced on Feb. 24 that it had shipped vials containing a first batch of coronavirus vaccine to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Clinical trials involving about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers are expected in April. As of Monday, Moderna’s stock is up nearly 50% since Feb. 3, a clear sign that capital is flowing to medical innovation.      Investors will have to evaluate health-related risks in the weeks and months ahead, and they may well see more volatility. But the efficiency of U.S. markets and the diligence of government and industry researchers working to develop a vaccine should give Americans hope. The coronavirus is the kind of problem that defies simple solutions, but markets are responding as they should—infusing capital for the most promising solutions. Amid market volatility, cool-headed capitalism finds a cure.     Ms. Friedman is president and CEO of Nasdaq Inc.
