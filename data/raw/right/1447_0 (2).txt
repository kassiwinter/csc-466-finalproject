                                                                                                                                         President Obama cast his ballot Monday in Chicago, taking advantage of early voting in Illinois in a photo-op effort to boost Democratic turnout in key states.                                                                                                                                                      “I’m so glad I can early vote,” he says while getting his ballot at the Dr. Martin Luther King Community Service Center. “I love voting. Everybody in Illinois, early vote.”                                                                                                                                                      He called early voting “a wonderful opportunity.”                                                                                                                                                                    When the president walked over to an electronic voting machine, he had to bend over somewhat to cast his ballot.                                                                                                                              “I will say this is made for folks who are a little short,” Mr. Obama said.                                                                                                                                                                 A poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “That’s me,” he said. The president also hugged a few other voters, who told them they love him.                                                                                                                              “I love you back,” Mr. Obama said.                                                                                                                              The president had already said at a rally Sunday night that he planned to vote for Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin, both seeking re-election.                                                                                                                   The president said he “can’t say” which candidates he voted for, but added, “This is the most important office of democracy, the office of citizenry.”
