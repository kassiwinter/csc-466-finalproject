WASHINGTON—The Obama administration declassified and released documents Wednesday that described past violations of a secret court order by National Security Agency programs set up to amass records on phone calls and Internet transactions. The violations weren't detailed in the three documents, but raised new concerns about the sweeping surveillance operations and opened the administration to new criticism from advocates of stricter limits. The documents also posed questions about why the NSA closed one of the programs, to collect so-called metadata on email and other Internet communications. A 2011 document called it a unique tool providing an "early warning system" to detect terrorist plots, which seemed to contradict recent claims by NSA officials that they shut the program down later that year because it lacked intelligence value.           
Related           Director of National Intelligence James Clapper declassified and released the three documents,as intelligence and law-enforcement officials defended the NSA activities at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.                The documents included a secret court order setting out the parameters of the phone-records program and two summaries from 2009 and 2011 that the Justice Department provided to Congress as part of an effort to renew the provisions of the Patriot Act, which provides the legal basis for the phone and now-closed Internet-data programs.      The declassification came as the Guardian newspaper released a classified document outlining another NSA program called XKEYSCORE, which detailed some of the NSA's Internet surveillance activities. The document highlighted the program's use at more than 150 sites around the world, mostly outside the U.S., and claimed the program helped in the capture of more than 300 terrorists.           The newly declassified documents highlighted the secrecy that shrouded the two programs. Two documents, prepared for lawmakers, are prefaced with a warning that disclosure would cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security.      The documents, in part, bolstered the Obama administration's argument that there are internal and external checks to ensure the programs, designed to collect vast amounts of Americans' data, aren't misused. However, a Justice Department document dated Feb. 2, 2011, which summarizes the two programs, devotes nearly a full page to "compliance issues" with both.      That 2011 document states that both the phone and Internet metadata programs had violated their court orders through "a number of technical compliance problems and human implementation errors" in 2009. Those problems were discovered by Justice Department and NSA reviews. Significant portions of the document were redacted and the details of the compliance problems weren't included.     Once discovered, the problems were reported to the secret national-security court, which placed restrictions on collection of the records until the problems were resolved to the court's satisfaction, the 2011 summary says.      The court imposed unspecified additional safeguards, according to the 2011 summary.     Sen.         Ron Wyden    (D., Ore.), a critic of the surveillance programs, said in a Senate floor speech Monday the problems were "more serious" than intelligence officials have suggested, but hasn't provided details.      The 2011 document also makes the government's case of the "intelligence value" of the phone and Internet data collection programs. Yet later that year, NSA shut down the Internet-metadata collection program, NSA Director         Keith Alexander    said in late June, because it "did not have the value to stop the terrorist attacks that we need."           The court order declassified and released Wednesday largely outlines previously known contours of the phone-data program, but one passage suggests the access to phone records is broader than officials have described. The section describes a computer-run sifting program that scans phone records with approved selection terms and then dumps that information into a "corporate store.''     Once the data are fed into the store, according to the court order, it "may then be searched by appropriately and adequately trained personnel for valid foreign intelligence purposes, without the requirement that those searches use only'' approved selection terms.     Patrick Toomey, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the language suggests "the government's ability to use the data acquired through the phone tracking program is not nearly as limited as it has suggested. Once you retain and store everything for unlimited search purposes, you eliminated any protections that you had at the outset.''     The NSA referred a request for comment to the Director of National Intelligence's office, which didn't immediately respond.      On Wednesday, senators pressed officials to explain the value of the phone-records program, which remains in effect.      NSA Deputy Director         John Inglis    reiterated the administration's view that the phone-records program helped gather evidence in a dozen U.S. terrorist plots, but he said that it is difficult to show the information couldn't have been obtained another way.      Security officials sought to renew their efforts to convince skeptical lawmakers that the surveillance programs are necessary to prevent terror attacks.              Sean Joyce,    deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said Internet, phone and other surveillance programs combine to stitch together small pieces of data pointing toward terror plots.
