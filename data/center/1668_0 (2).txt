Rather than look outside the Secret Service’s ranks for new leadership—as a panel of outside experts had recommended—the president chose a 27-year agency veteran and trusted insider who led the division that protects Mr. Obama during his first two years in office.      Mr. Clancy will assume control of an agency facing a level of scrutiny it hasn’t seen in decades, as lawmakers question its ability to handle its dual missions of protecting dignitaries and fighting financial crime.     Secret Service officials have said both duties are crucial, and have pushed hard in recent years for a larger agency role in investigating cyberbreaches that expose payment information. But at a hearing last week, House members of both parties suggested they could try to steer some of the service’s investigative work to another agency.               House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) said he was disappointed by Mr. Obama’s decision not to hire from outside the agency.     “The good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start,” he said. “At this moment in time, the Secret Service would best be served by a transformative and dynamic leader from outside the agency.”     Mr. Clancy has served as interim director since October, when Julia Pierson resigned as director under pressure. After retiring from the Secret Service in 2011, Mr. Clancy worked as chief of security at         Comcast Corp.    He was considered for the top Secret Service job in 2013 before pulling his name from consideration, according to a person familiar with the matter.     Mr. Obama called Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson Wednesday morning to inform him of the decision before calling Mr. Clancy.     “Joe has done an outstanding job leading the Secret Service since he returned at my request in October of last year,” the president said in a statement. “He understands the challenges facing the agency and has proven that he’s not afraid to make the tough decisions necessary to build and maintain the agency’s ability to carry out its mission.”     Mr. Clancy returned to the Secret Service as the agency was reeling from a series of embarrassing stumbles, including a September incident in which a man climbed the White House fence, knocked back a Secret Service agent, and managed to run into the executive mansion before being subdued.     In December, a panel appointed by Mr. Johnson reviewed the agency and found an “organization starved for leadership.” The experts concluded an outsider was needed to lead an agency that had become too insular and stretched beyond its limits.     White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Clancy had shown a willingness to conduct a clear-eyed assessment of the organization’s shortcomings and implement needed reforms. Four top Secret Service officials were removed from their jobs in January, and the agency’s second-highest ranking official stepped down from his post earlier this month.      —Andrew Grossman contributed to this article.
