      	Rep. Rashida Tlaib was briefly detained by police Friday during a protest with airline workers at Detroit Metro Airport. The congresswoman was on hand to demand better pay and health care for the employees.
“We won’t stop until we get #fairwages & #healthcare. These courageous people got arrested tonight at DTW b/c they believe workers deserve human dignity,” the Michigan Democrat said in a tweeted statement, sharing a smiling photo of herself with protesters. “Shame on you @Delta for leaving workers behind and letting them live in poverty. @unitehere
“These workers are suffering and living under unimaginable conditions all because Delta wants to make more profits on the backs of the poor,” she added.
Tlaib herself was not processed as an arrest with the other protesters, according to a protester on hand and was swiftly released.
The squad member was joined at the protest by her House comrade Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) who stopped by offer some extra solidarity, Deadline Detroit reported. Tlaib is no stranger to making scene. In Aug. 8, 2016, before she was in Congress, a kicking and screaming Tlaib had to be physically removed from a Trump rally in Detroit.
“You guys are crazy,” she yelled repeatedly after being escorted out by security.
