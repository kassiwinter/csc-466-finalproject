NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday announced the creation of a select House committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot following the failure last month of a bipartisan effort to form an independent commission in the Senate.Pelosi said she hoped the 9/11-style commission would become a reality, but after Senate Republicans blocked its creation, she could not wait any longer to launch a deeper dive into the events surrounding the takeover of the Capitol. She created a House committee to investigate the origins of the attack and make recommendations on how to prevent a future riot.SENATE REPUBLICANS SLAM BRAKES ON BILL TO CREATE COMMISSION PROBING CAPITOL RIOT"Many questions regarding the circumstances of this assault on our democracy and the response to it remain," Pelosi said Thursday at a Capitol news conference. "It is imperative that we seek the truth of what happened."MANCHIN WON'T COMMIT TO PROGRESSIVES' INFRASTRUCTURE WISH LISTMembership of the committee has not yet been announced, but Pelosi said the body will dig into the root causes of the attack, including White supremacy, and the security issues at the Capitol.

They've raised concerns on whether another investigation is necessary and whether a continued public focus on the attack would hurt their chances of winning the 2022 midterm elections. "It is clear Republicans are afraid of the truth," Pelosi said Thursday. Prior to Pelosi's announcement, McCarthy Wednesday signaled he was satisfied with the investigations underway at the FBI and in the Senate and accused Pelosi of "trying to play politics" with Jan. 6.
