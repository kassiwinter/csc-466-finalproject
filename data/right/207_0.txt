 The DNC is predicting Mitt Romney will win the first presidential debate against Barack Obama this week in Denver. Why? So if Obama totally bombs he won't look as bad. Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse tells Fox News he thinks Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will win.
Woodhouse says the way the DNC sees it, challengers win the first debate when they are up against incumbents.
"Mitt Romney has had a lot more time to debate, the president has not debated in the past four years in terms, of a campaign debate. I think the president will hold his own, but he's not known for sound bites. And these are 60 second, 90 second responses."
Woodhouse says Democrats are "trying to be realistic about expectations" because the president is "lucky to be able to devote three consecutive hours to debate preparation." Yes, Democrats want you to believe a president who spends the majority of his time campaigning and not in the Oval Office, doesn't have time for debate prep.
