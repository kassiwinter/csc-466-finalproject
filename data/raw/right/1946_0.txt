           Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in a real-time Iowa State Fair straw poll Saturday, polling ahead of her by double digits, 52-41, according to the website of the Iowa secretary of state.
Though very unscientific, it did sustain the pace that Sanders is hitting in New Hampshire and other states, where he is gaining ground if not outright surpassing Clinton.
Specifically, more than 52 percent of Democrats who have cast a vote in the straw poll say they support Sanders. Just over 41 percent said they support Clinton. On Friday, the second day of the fair, Sanders and Clinton were tied 46-46.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley garnered just three percent while Lincoln Chafee got just 1 percent. Former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb came in under 1 percent.
The poll confirmed many recent polls in Iowa and elsewhere for Republicans with Donald Trump getting 27 percent followed by Ben Carson with 18 percent and Ted Cruz with 8 percent. Clinton still maintains a large lead over Sanders in Iowa in more scientific polls. According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 50 percent support Clinton, 31 percent back Sanders, and 12 said they would vote for Vice President Joe Biden, who is reportedly considering running. But a poll out of New Hampshire released this week showed Sanders leading Clinton 44-38.           Â© 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
