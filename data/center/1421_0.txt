         The U.S. added nearly 84,000 coronavirus cases for the second-straight day, with new infections coming in barely below the daily record set the previous day.     Saturday’s total of 83,718 new cases marks the second-highest single-day count after the record 83,757 infections logged Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has reported nearly 8.58 million infections in total, with the death toll nearing 225,000.             
Latest on the Virus The U.S. added 83,718 cases on Saturday, its second-highest number. Nearly 8.58 million infections have been reported in the U.S. since the pandemic began.        Epidemiologists anticipated an increase of cases in the fall as cooler weather brings Americans indoors, where there is a higher risk of transmission. But this surge is coming earlier than many expected.     From September to October, Covid-19 cases have risen in all regions, but the rise has been particularly acute in the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains. At least seven states reported record one-day totals of new infections on Saturday. Illinois logged more than 6,100 cases, while Michigan reported nearly 3,500. Ohio recorded more than 2,800 infections, while Colorado and Oklahoma each reported more than 1,820 cases. New Mexico and Alaska also reported record one-day tallies.               Similar to the surges the country saw in the spring and summer, the rising number of cases nationally has been accompanied by an uptick in hospitalizations. Hospitalizations in the U.S. approached 42,000 on Saturday, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. It was the fourth straight day with more than 40,000 Covid-19 patients in hospitals.          Epidemiologists and public-health researchers have said a number of factors, from pandemic fatigue to the return of college students to campuses and more social gatherings, are contributing to the latest rise in U.S. cases. The recent increases are affecting broader swaths of the U.S. than the spring and summer surges, when outbreaks were heavily concentrated in a handful of states.     Cases of Covid-19 are now growing both in places that have long had a high prevalence of the new coronavirus as well as new, less populous parts of the country that haven’t yet experienced it.

That is a shift from earlier in the pandemic, when there were more cases per 100,000 people in metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan areas.     “People had hoped that in the summer it would get better, and it did for a short period, and then as we engaged in communities it increased again,” said         Randall Williams,    director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.

The U.S. never experienced a substantial decline in new cases, unlike in Europe, where infections dipped during the summer before ticking up again in the fall.     Epidemiologists say the persistently high level of cases in the U.S. was partly due to the lack of a national strategy in containing the virus.     “Instead of asking these questions about what we’re seeing across the United States, we’re just kind of saying go back to work, ignore everything…which I think is the wrong message to send,” said         Emily Landon,    an infectious disease expert at the University of Chicago Medicine.     —Jennifer Calfas and Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.
