The U.S. hit a milestone in the coronavirus pandemic as all 50 states have now begun reopening, working to revive their economies after months of shutdowns designed to curb the contagion. Slight declines in new confirmed cases in some states have prompted governors from New York to Ohio to restart some services, with rules varying from place to place, including restaurants, churches and schools. On Wednesday, Connecticut became one of the last states to loosen restrictions. Washington, D.C., remains under stay-at-home orders, and large parts of states, including major metropolitan areas, are still largely shut. In most states, the reopenings are happening in phases.     Absent mandated federal guidelines, local leaders looking to reopen have weighed the potential costs to the economy and public health, relying on sources including virus data, task forces, public-health leaders and their own constituencies.               A big question remaining is whether cases will go up as people re-emerge.      Most states are moving to reopen before they have met criteria set by the Trump administration such as a two-week decline in the number of new cases or in the percentage of Covid-19 tests that are positive. The administration’s plan leaves the decision about when to reopen up to governors.      Two states—Michigan and New Mexico—had met the criteria as of May 18, according to Covidexitstrategy.org, a tracking system run by a group of public-health and crisis experts. A few other states met the criteria in previous days but dropped back due to rising cases or declines in testing.      The daily number of positive tests for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has risen or remained flat over the past two weeks in 24 states, according to Covidexitstrategy.org, a worrying sign for a disease that is highly transmissible and can cause deadly complications from head to toe. The disease is more contagious and deadlier than the flu, according to public health data from several countries.      More than 1.55 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and over 93,000 deaths have been recorded, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, including 1,485 between 8 p.m. Tuesday and the same time Wednesday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. World-wide, there are some 4.96 million confirmed infections, and more than 326,000 reported deaths.     Experts caution that official numbers likely understate the extent of the pandemic in part because of limited and differing testing capabilities for the virus.     Covid-19 can cause damage far beyond the lungs, affecting the brain, kidneys, heart, vascular and digestive systems. Some patients have sudden strokes, pulmonary emboli, or kidney failure. Children have developed an inflammatory condition resembling Kawasaki disease. Some people even develop “Covid toe,” a painful purplish swelling caused by blood clots.      About 10% to 20% of people who are infected become severely ill and can develop such complications, according to public health data, though more population-wide testing is needed to determine the true percentage.     Public-health officials fear a new wave of illnesses if states reopen too broadly, a move that could overwhelm hospital intensive care units. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released recommendations last weekend intended to help restaurants and bars, mass transit, and other sectors of the economy prevent transmission.      Other public health experts are weighing in, too. Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit initiative of the global health organization Vital Strategies, released a color-coded alert system for local and state governments, as well as other countries. The system is based on seven indicators that rate a country or region’s risk from red (“very high risk”) to green (“new normal”).      “It holds governments accountable for what they’re doing and what they’re reporting, and it accelerates progress toward a new normal where we’re safer,” said         Tom Frieden,    president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, and a former director of the CDC. “It’s not right to think of this as health versus economics.”         The Latest on the Coronavirus  Johns Hopkins: U.S. cases above 1.5 million; deaths exceed 93,000 Johns Hopkins: More than 4.9 million cases world-wide; deaths above 326,000 Germany moves to secure its coronavirus-drug production from foreign attempts to acquire German companies working on vaccines State governments estimate that fighting the pandemic has cost about $45 billion        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has fast tracked the process for experimental vaccines, and drugmaker Moderna injected a dose of hope into the process earlier this week when it reported positive results from the first human study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine. Still, a viable candidate remains months away, with more time required to manufacture enough vaccine for the world’s population.     Until then, public health officials say measures including more increased testing capabilities and robust contact-tracing programs are necessary for safely easing restrictions. But changing and often inconsistent information has hampered efforts to create a clear snapshot of how the U.S. is doing as a whole in its fight against the pandemic.      The patchwork of state rules and regulations has further complicated the picture.

California was one of the earliest states to issue a stay-at-home order and only recently began relaxing restrictions, though curbs in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area are expected to remain in place for some time. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s order late last month to allow nonessential businesses such as hair salons and gyms to open was one of the nation’s most aggressive reopenings.      As states begin to reopen, governors and other leaders are having to navigate a host of new issues. They are thinking about the safety of reopened plants, open-plan offices and public transportation, confronting state budgets hit by sudden revenue shortages and figuring out how to conduct elections with social-distancing.     In Michigan, that included natural disaster. Flooding in Midland County forced thousands to flee their homes after two dams breached.         Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,    who issued a state of emergency, encouraged people to continue to wear masks and practice social distancing to the best of their ability.

Ford Motor Co.    , meanwhile, stopped assembly lines at assembly plants in Chicago and Michigan, in a second straight day of disrupted output that highlighted challenges the auto industry they attempt to resume work during the Covid-19 outbreak.     American companies have been reworking safety procedures to keep workers healthy as they return to the job, from changing floor plans to requiring regular health screenings at entrances and protective equipment.      Ahead of the Michigan’s August primary and November general elections, state Secretary of State         Jocelyn Benson    said Tuesday that all registered voters would receive applications for absentee ballots in the mail. Nevada, meanwhile, plans to hold a mostly vote-by-mail primary election in June.          President Trump threatened Wednesday to withhold federal funding from both states because of the moves, calling them illegal.      While researchers have found rare instances of absentee-voter fraud, studies show it isn’t widespread.     Georgia, Iowa and West Virginia also have recently chosen to automatically send absentee-ballot applications to voters. In Texas, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that voters who want to vote by mail because of the pandemic would be allowed to do so in the November elections. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, said he planned to appeal the decision.     State governments estimate the collective expense of fighting the pandemic at some $45 billion; most want the federal government to repay in full, rather than be reimbursed at the 75% rate allowed under the law, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said.          Organizations representing state, territorial and local governments asked Congress on Wednesday to approve an aid package that would help fund services and essential jobs as states, cities and counties face budget shortfalls.              Texas Gov. Greg Abbott    on Wednesday asked state agencies and universities to reduce their budgets by 5% because of the “economic shock” caused by the pandemic. New York’s state government is holding back more than $1 billion of planned spending.         California Gov. Gavin Newsom,    who months ago announced a $5.6 billion budget surplus, has outlined a revised budget plan as the state anticipated a $54.3 billion hole in the current and coming fiscal years.      As countries around the globe allow businesses and schools to reopen, officials are taking new precautions to mitigate any resurgence of infections.     Germany, working to curb a string of coronavirus outbreaks in slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, Wednesday imposed tougher hygiene inspection regimes and higher fines for breaching the rules. The country also moved to secure its own production of medical equipment and drugs, tightening a regulation that enables the government to veto takeover bids for German health-care companies.

In France, the government asked citizens and permanent residents returning from outside Europe to voluntarily submit to a 14-day quarantine. Spain will require face masks on anyone over the age 6 when outdoors or in enclosed public spaces, except where social distancing is possible.     But there is no clear indication that the pandemic is retreating world-wide. Brazil posted a record daily high of 1,179 fatalities Tuesday. The nation now has the world’s third-largest total of confirmed infections, with more than 271,000. Medical experts say the numbers there aren’t likely to peak until June.     Iran on Wednesday reported 2,346 new cases, the most in a day since the government began a slow reopening of society in mid-April. India also recorded a new daily high, with 5,611 confirmed cases on Tuesday.     A fresh outbreak in China’s northeast, meanwhile, has driven the government to reimpose lockdown conditions across a number of cities in the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang.                                         The U.S.’s top economic policy leaders outline contrasting visions; FEMA says as many as 39 states have requested full reimbursement of some coronavirus expenses; South Korean high school seniors resume classes.
