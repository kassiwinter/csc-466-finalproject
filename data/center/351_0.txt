WASHINGTON—The Senate barreled toward a pair of Wednesday deadlines for advancing much of President Biden’s multitrillion-dollar economic agenda, with lawmakers bracing for a procedural vote on a still-forming $1 trillion infrastructure plan to fail as bipartisan negotiations dragged on.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has set a vote for Wednesday to begin consideration of infrastructure legislation, a step that Republicans have said they would oppose absent more details on its contents and how it would be paid for. Mr. Schumer is also pushing for all 50 members of the Democratic caucus to agree on Wednesday to a $3.5 trillion outline for a broad antipoverty and climate package they are pursuing in parallel to the bipartisan infrastructure talks. Democrats on the Budget Committee and Mr. Schumer had announced a deal on the budget framework last week.     While Democrats are planning to pass the $3.5 trillion plan through a budget process that requires a simple majority in the Senate, they will need the support of at least 10 Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the separate infrastructure deal. Several Republicans involved in the infrastructure talks said they would vote against the procedural motion on Wednesday without a completed agreement on infrastructure.                                         Budget reconciliation might offer Democrats a way to sidestep some partisan gridlock and advance President Biden’s policy objectives. WSJ explains how the process works and why divisions in the party could scuttle the process.

They won’t get 60,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) said of Wednesday’s vote. “Our members are committed to actually having a bill and scores and all that kind of stuff before they vote to get on a bill.”               Mr. Schumer said the Wednesday vote was a way to begin the floor process for considering legislation, while still allowing negotiations to continue.     “It is not a final deadline for legislative text. It is not a cynical ploy. It is not a fish-or-cut-bait moment. It is not an attempt to jam anyone,” he said.     The bipartisan group of lawmakers that have led the infrastructure talks were set to meet again Tuesday afternoon, and some Republicans said they could likely complete their agreement by the end of the week and asked Mr. Schumer to delay the procedural vote until Monday.     “We’ve resolved probably three-quarters of them in the last two days and I would expect that by the end of the week we would have them all resolved,” said         Sen. Mitt Romney    (R., Utah).     Mr. Schumer declined to comment Tuesday on whether he would bring the infrastructure bill up again if the procedural vote fails Wednesday. Some Democrats are pushing for the party to move on from the bipartisan talks.      If the vote fails Wednesday, “we need to move on,” said         Rep. Pramila Jayapal    (D., Wash.), chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She said Democrats should fold the infrastructure bill into the budget package. “How long are we going to wait?”     At the center of the continued disagreements is deciding how to pay for the infrastructure spending, about $600 billion of which is above projected federal spending if current programs continued.     Mr. Romney said that lawmakers were still negotiating over which Covid-19 aid to repurpose toward infrastructure, and Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) said the bipartisan group had also been in discussions with the White House about which unused Covid-19 funds could be repurposed to help offset the infrastructure bill’s cost.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat do you think the final infrastructure package will look like? Join the conversation below.        Lawmakers involved in recent days abandoned a plan to bolster tax enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service after growing Republican opposition to the idea. The group had earlier hoped to generate roughly $100 billion from collecting more taxes owed but not paid.     To try to fill some of the funding shortfall created by dropping the IRS provision, lawmakers are looking at repealing or further delaying a Trump administration proposal to curb rebates that pharmacy-benefit managers pay to drugmakers and plans. The Congressional Budget Office has previously determined that the provision would cost the federal government roughly $180 billion over a decade.     Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said lawmakers were considering delaying the rule by several more years. Democrats have been hoping to delay or repeal the rule to help pay for the cost of their $3.5 trillion budget package. One possibility is that the bipartisan group could delay it for several more years to capture part of the savings, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

Finding enough savings and raising enough revenue will also be a significant challenge as Democrats try to unify around the $3.5 trillion plan. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) said she hadn’t seen details of the plan, a day ahead of Mr. Schumer’s deadline for Democrats reaching unanimous support for it in the Senate.     “I’m not going to comment on it,” she said.     Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) hasn’t publicly committed to supporting the budget resolution.     “We’re still working on it,” he said Tuesday.      Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said he thought that centrists would ultimately support the deal.     “I’m absolutely confident that we have the votes,” Mr. Sanders said.
