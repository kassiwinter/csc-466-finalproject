The U.S. on Tuesday blocked the adoption of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a probe into the violence that broke out on the Gaza border Monday.The statement expressed “outrage and sorrow" over the violence on Monday that left more than 50 dead and called for an "independent and transparent investigation" into the deaths, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.The Telegraph reported that the statement urged all nations to adhere to the Security Council resolution calling for countries to not establish diplomatic missions in Jerusalem, which is highly contested by the Israelis and Palestinians.Palestinians seek to make east Jerusalem the capital of a future state.The statement was drafted by Kuwait and directly addressed the violence, which was spurred by the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.The development comes ahead of a Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the clashes. The Telegraph reported that is was unclear if any other Security Council members rejected the statement.More than 50 Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire on the Gaza border on Monday while hundreds of others were left injured as waves of Palestinians attempted to cross the border into Israel. The White House has laid blame on Hamas for the violence.“The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response,” White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah told reporters on Monday."We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that Hamas is the one that, frankly, bears responsibility for the entire situation right now,” he continued. However, other countries have condemned Israeli's actions on the border. German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert on Tuesday said the violence “concerns us greatly and it’s terrible that so many people lost their lives, including minors.”Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called Israel's actions “unacceptable violence” and said “there is a clear lack of proportionality and we are asking for an international investigation.”South Africa took the step of recalling it's ambassador to Israel in the wake of the violence, while Ireland summoned its Israeli ambassador to express its “shock and dismay” over Israel's actions. Some funerals for the Palestinians killed in the clashes were held on Tuesday.
