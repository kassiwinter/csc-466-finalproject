The personal feud between Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Donald Trump took a nasty turn Friday with an exchange about charges of marital infidelity and a new round of insults between the two candidates’ camps.Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, used an impromptu press conference in Wisconsin to bat down a National Enquirer article that cited rumors alleging that he has cheated on his wife—and in the process accused Mr. Trump and his “henchmen” of driving the piece. Mr. Trump responded by denying any involvement in the piece.      A race that began as a conversation about immigration, economic growth and conservative strategies for helping people at the bottom rungs of the country’s socio-economic ladder is, for the moment, being dominated by the increasingly personal back-and-forth between the front-runner, Mr. Trump, and the candidate with the next-most delegates, Mr. Cruz.                                         Ted Cruz blamed presidential rival Donald Trump on Friday for a tabloid story that aired rumors about Cruz's personal life. Trump responded that he had nothing to do with it.

They also came two days after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) implored members of both parties to be more civil and respectful.               In reference to the piece about marital infidelity, Mr. Cruz said in a post on his Facebook page: “I want to be crystal clear: These attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won’t go.”     That was one of several efforts the Texas senator made Friday to denounce the accusations—though by commenting publicly, he thrust them directly into the campaign conversation.     In remarks to reporters in Wisconsin, Mr. Cruz called the Enquirer piece “complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.” Mr. Cruz noted that the article quoted an on-and-off Trump political adviser, Roger Stone, who left the Trump campaign in an acrimonious split last summer. In a Twitter post, Mr. Stone said Mr. Cruz’s comments were inaccurate.     Mr. Trump released a statement denying any role in getting the Enquirer piece published. “I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week’s issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it and have not, as yet, read it,” Mr. Trump said.      The sniping between the two candidates followed a segment Friday on CNN in which a Trump supporter accused a Republican strategist appearing on the air with her of having an affair with Mr. Cruz.                                                 Republican presidential contender Donald Trump, shown last year, denied playing a role in the Enquirer article.

Mr. Cruz reacted angrily, saying he had nothing to do the with the ad and calling Mr. Trump a “sniveling coward” for attacking his wife.     Amid Friday’s back and forth, Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe sought to take the fight in a new direction by questioning Mr. Trump’s mental stability. In a Twitter post, he pointed out that the New York businessman hasn’t done a campaign event in four days and has none planned for the next eight, asking, “Ever had a psychological eval?     “What is hiding in medical records,” Mr. Roe continued. “Release!”     The political dialogue between two of the three remaining Republican presidential contenders seems to typify the name-calling and personal attacks Mr. Ryan decried in a speech earlier in the week.      “It did not used to be this bad, and it does not have to be this way,” Mr. Ryan said in a Wednesday speech delivered to congressional interns. “We shouldn’t accept ugliness as the norm.”     Write to Patrick O’Connor at patrick.oconnor@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
