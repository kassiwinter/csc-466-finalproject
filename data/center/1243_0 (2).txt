Republican Party leaders and their allies in the business community notched wins Tuesday in a series of competitive primaries in North Carolina and Ohio, an early sign they are gaining the upper hand over conservative activists ahead of other key 2014 primaries.In North Carolina, Republican primary voters picked House Speaker Thom Tillis as their nominee to square off against Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in November, thanks in part to millions of dollars in last-minute advertising by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups aligned with GOP leaders.                                                                                                                                In other results favorable to the GOP establishment, House Speaker         John Boehner    easily dispatched three primary opponents in Ohio, and Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers repelled a conservative challenger in North Carolina. Former state Sen. David Rouzer, a candidate backed by the Chamber of Commerce, won a competitive primary in North Carolina for the chance to retake a seat held by Democrats.     GOP leaders and their backers have been careful to frame their endorsements as a push to nominate candidates with the best chance of winning in the fall, not an ideological crusade to sanitize the party.                Even so, few of the conservative candidates who announced bids to challenge incumbent Republicans look viable at this stage in the 2014 election cycle. The victories Tuesday by leadership-backed candidates in North Carolina and Ohio set the stage for other contested primaries in Georgia and Kentucky on May 20, and in Iowa and Mississippi, which vote on June 3.     Last year at this time, a collection of conservative groups vowed to unseat incumbent Republicans who crossed them on budget matters, proposed changes to immigration law and other issues. At this point, few substantial challenges have materialized, threatening the credibility of the groups that made those threats, including FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund. Two candidates backed by FreedomWorks, for example, lost on Tuesday.     Mr. Tillis won almost 46% of the vote—more than the 40% share needed to avoid a costly and potentially bruising runoff with another Republican. Obstetrician Greg Brannon was in second place with 27%, and Baptist pastor         Mark Harris    was third, with almost 18%.     Republican Party leaders and outside groups poured millions of dollars into television ads and other outreach in North Carolina on Mr. Tillis's behalf. They viewed him as the best candidate to unseat Ms. Hagan, citing his record as speaker and his ability to raise money.     The North Carolina results Tuesday set the table for a Senate race that promises to be one of the most competitive in the country. Super PACs and other political groups already have spent millions in the state, dwarfing the amounts spent by the candidates themselves.     Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group funded in part by billionaire industrialists Charles and         David Koch,    has spent more than $7.2 million attacking Ms. Hagan. Senate Majority PAC, a group aligned with Senate Democrats, has spent nearly $4 million on ads criticizing Mr. Tillis.     Republican leaders and their outside allies are working to tip the scales in a string of upcoming party contests in favor of candidates they believe will be the most competitive in the fall.     Mr. Tillis campaigned on the "conservative revolution" he said he led as speaker of the state House. He highlighted his role passing legislation to lower tax rates, cut spending and block an expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 health law.     For much of the year, Mr. Tillis largely has ignored the swipes of his fellow Republicans, training his fire instead on Ms. Hagan, who was elected in 2008 when         Barack Obama    carried the state in his first presidential election. Mr. Tillis argued that Ms. Hagan is out of step with the bulk of North Carolina voters because she has supported much of Mr. Obama's agenda, including the Affordable Care Act.     Democrats already have spent months attacking Mr. Tillis, blaming the tax package he passed for a budget shortfall and criticizing nearly $500 million in cuts to public education, new limits on voting and a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.     Ms. Hagan immediately sought to frame the race as a test of competing values. She said Mr. Tillis has spent his time in the state capital of Raleigh "pushing a special-interest agenda that has rigged the system against middle class families," referring to legislation that passed on his watch.     Mr. Tillis earned the "establishment" label, thanks to financial support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other GOP leaders, as well as last-minute endorsements from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.     Tea-party activists rallied around Mr. Brannon, who was endorsed by Kentucky Sen.         Rand Paul    and a number of prominent conservative groups. Many evangelicals backed Mr. Harris, the preferred pick of former Arkansas Gov.         Mike Huckabee.    In the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Paul campaigned for Mr. Brannon in Charlotte, and Mr. Huckabee recorded automated phone calls for Mr. Harris.     In the end, Mr. Tillis and his allies drowned out his rivals on the airwaves. By mid-April, he had spent $2.1 million, nearly twice as much as Mr. Brannon and almost three times more than Mr. Harris, Federal Election Commission data showed.     In addition, American Crossroads spent more than $1.6 million on television ads supporting Mr. Tillis in the weeks leading up to the primary, and the Chamber of Commerce spent more than $1 million in the past week alone.     Once the results were in, Mr. Paul quickly endorsed Mr. Tillis. "Now that the primary is over, it is time for our side to unite to defeat the Democrat who cast the deciding vote for ObamaCare, Kay Hagan, in November," he said on his Facebook page.
