MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C.—The South Carolina Republican primary is closing with a flurry of accusations and gripes about underhanded campaign tactics in a state renowned for being a breeding ground for political dirty tricks.      Donald Trump        is charging         Ted Cruz    with handing out “voter violation” forms to fool people into backing the Texas senator. Mr. Cruz railed against Mr. Trump for sending him a cease-and-desist order to take down his attack ads. And         Marco Rubio    is blaming Mr. Cruz’s campaign for false rumors that South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy has withdrawn his endorsement of the Florida senator. And those are just the allegations that piled up within a span of 24 hours this week, as the clock ticks to Saturday’s election.        
More on Election 2016        The Cruz campaign didn’t respond to a request to comment on the accusation that it distributed “voter violation” forms, or on the rumors concerning Mr. Gowdy’s endorsement. Mr. Cruz has said Mr. Trump is attacking him because he is losing support.                  The boisterous protests come as the race appears to be tightening in the final days, with Mr. Trump still in the lead while the others brawl for second place.     They are also a mainstay of South Carolina politics, once the home of legendary GOP strategist         Lee Atwater,    who mastered the subtle use of race to attack his opponents. In the 2000 Republican primary here, Sen.         John McCain    was subjected to false rumors that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock.     Given that history, all of the Republican candidates arrived in the Palmetto State on alert for any shenanigans, even as party leaders and many voters shrug them off as part of the vetting a presidential nominee must endure.     “I’m of the belief that iron sharpens iron,” said         Matt Moore,    chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. “I think our nominee will eventually be stronger after they’ve faced months of tough campaigning.”     In Anderson on Thursday afternoon, Gov.         Nikki Haley,    who has endorsed Mr. Rubio, said it was all par for the course. “When you come to South Carolina, it’s a blood sport,” she said.     “I wear heels,” she added. “It’s not for a fashion statement. It’s because you’ve got to be prepared to kick at any time.”                                         South Carolina's Republican voters have a reputation for picking winners, and a new NBC News/WSJ/Marist poll shows a tightening race ahead of Saturday's primary.

There have been claims of a “dishonest” push poll, a threatened lawsuit, and charges by the campaign of former Florida Gov.         Jeb Bush    that Mr. Rubio’s campaign team was behind a story claiming the Bush campaign would stop paying its staffers this weekend. A spokesman for Mr. Rubio denied the charge and suggested the Bush team’s accusation itself was the “dirty trick.”     Most of the fire, however, has been directed by Messrs. Trump and Rubio at Mr. Cruz, as the businessman and the Florida senator attempt to stall any momentum for the Texas senator.     Following complaints from Mr. Rubio’s campaign, some local television stations, after a legal review, earlier this week pulled an ad by a pro-Cruz super PAC that attacked the Florida senator’s record on immigration.     The Rubio team claimed victory, but by midweek the Cruz camp was out with a mailer and website depicting Mr. Rubio’s face morphed with that of President         Barack Obama    and declaring the candidate to be Mr. Obama’s “Republican clone.”     The website also contained an image of Messrs. Obama and Rubio appearing to shake hands, which Mr. Rubio’s campaign alleged Thursday the Cruz team had cooked up using Photoshop, an allegation that the Cruz camp neither confirmed nor denied.     South Carolina state Rep.         Neal Collins,    a Rubio supporter, said the morphed mailer image of Mr. Obama, who is black, and Mr. Rubio, who is Latino, appeared to have an inappropriate racial subtext. It was sent to Republicans in Pickens County, which is rural and 90% white. “There’s possibly some undertone there,” said Mr. Collins, “particularly in Pickens County.”     Asked about the mailer, a spokesman for Mr. Cruz denied any intended racial element to the image.      On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz had sought to turn attention back to his targets.

But in the current race “every metric says Republican voters’ engagement levels are through the roof.”     South Carolina GOP consultant Chip Felkel said the prevalence of social media in this year’s campaign season has inflamed the backbiting. Mr. Felkel, who isn’t associated with any campaign, added that the attacks strengthen not only the eventual nominee but also that person’s entire political operation.     “It’s an unpleasant part of the process, but I do think it toughens up the campaign staff even more so than the candidate themselves, because they have to be prepared to deal with this kind of stuff,” he said.     At a rally for Mr. Rubio in Mount Pleasant on Wednesday,         Phil Jackey,    a 78-year-old retiree from Summerville, attributed the heated tenor to Mr. Trump, saying the race is more ferocious than others he has witnessed, “primarily because of the lead dog.”     “That’s stirring things up,” he said, adding that he believes the infighting will hurt the party. “I think they’re helping the Democrats considerably by doing that.”     Others said that while they dislike the nasty rhetoric and stream of accusations, they believe the behavior is a necessary evil for candidates who want to survive in South Carolina.     “I think they have to defend themselves,” said         Lionel Lawson,    an undecided 66-year-old retiree who attended the Mount Pleasant rally. “Look at what [Ohio Gov.]         John Kasich    is doing. He’s taking the high road, and he’s at the bottom of the pack.”     —Valerie Bauerlein and Patrick O’Connor contributed to this article.      Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
