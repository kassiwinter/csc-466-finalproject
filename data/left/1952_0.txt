                                                                                        8:56 pm ET                                 By Amy Chozick                                                                                                                                                       8:56 pm ET8:56 pm ET  	By   	Amy Chozick                                                                                                                                                   NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. — In a testy exchange with Ed Henry of Fox News on Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her handling of the server that hosted the personal email account she exclusively used                         as secretary of state and reiterated that she did not receive any emails that were marked as classified.                       “Ed, you’re not listening to me,” Mrs. Clinton said after the cable news reporter asked another follow-up question about the email issue. She said the process of investigating what was potentially                         classified would be playing out the same way had she used an official government account.                       “This is part of the ordinary process,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Everybody is acting like it’s the first time it’s ever happened. It happens all the time.”                       When pressed as to whether she took responsibility for the controversy her private email use has prompted, Mrs. Clinton said, “I regret this has become such a cause célèbre, but that does not                         change the facts.”                       “I know there’s a certain level of sort of anxiety or interest in this, but the facts are the facts,” she said.                       Mrs. Clinton has fielded questions about the email controversy at almost every stop on the campaign since she announced her candidacy for the presidency in April, but the exchange on Tuesday was particularly                         tense.                       At one point Mr. Henry asked Mrs. Clinton about an NBC News report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may be able to recover some of the messages on the server and whether she had tried to wipe the server                         clean before handing it over to the F.B.I. That exchange follows:                       Mr. Henry: Did you try to wipe the entire server?                       Mrs. Clinton: My personal emails are my personal business, right? We went through a painstaking process and turned over 55,000 pages of anything we thought could be work-related. Under the law,                         that decision is made by the official. I was the official. I made those decisions, and as I just said over 1,200 of the emails have already been deemed not work-related. All I can tell you is in retrospect                         had I used a government account and I’d said: “You know what, let’s release everything. Let’s let everybody in America see what I did for four years,” we would have the                         same arguments.                       Mr. Henry: Answer the question. Did you try to wipe the whole server? You didn’t answer the question.                       Mrs. Clinton: I don’t. I have no idea, that’s why I turned it over.                       Mr. Henry: You were the official in charge of it. Did you wipe the server?                       Mrs. Clinton: What? With a cloth or something?                       Mr. Henry: I don’t know. You know how it works digitally.                       Mrs. Clinton: I don’t know how it works digitally at all.                       Mr. Henry: So you didn’t try? You did not try?                       Mrs. Clinton: Ed, I know you want to make a point and I can just repeat what I said.                       Mr. Henry: It’s a simple question.                       Mrs. Clinton: In order to be as cooperative as possible we have turned over the server. They can do whatever they want to with the server to figure out what is there and not there. That’s                         for the people investigating it to figure out. But we have turned over everything that was work-related, every single thing. Personal stuff, we did not. I had no obligation to do so and did not.                       After that, Mrs. Clinton started to depart the gymnasium here, where she had just concluded a wide-ranging town hall meeting. An NBC News reporter shouted, “Is this an indication that this issue isn’t                         going to go away for the remainder of your campaign?”                       But by then a visibly irritated Mrs. Clinton had already made her way toward the door. She threw a wristy wave goodbye to the press corps as she said, “Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys.”
