Federal agents on Thursday arrested a friend of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters on charges he conspired to support terrorism and acted as the straw buyer of the two rifles used in the attacks that killed 14 and injured more than 20 earlier this month.The criminal complaint against Enrique Marquez revealed new details of the federal investigation into the shooting, including evidence Mr. Marquez and Syed Rizwan Farook had earlier plotted to attack a California freeway and bomb a community college in 2011 and 2012. Mr. Marquez, 24 years old, of Riverside, Calif., was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, making a false statement in connection with the purchase of firearms, and entering into a “sham marriage” with a woman who was the sister of Mr. Farook’s brother’s wife, in order to allow the woman to legally reside in the U.S.     The terrorism charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, and the firearms violations and immigration-fraud charge each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.               A lawyer for Mr. Marquez, Young Joon Kim, said on Thursday that he had no comment on the complaint. Mr. Marquez has been cooperating with investigators, according to law-enforcement officials.     Mr. Marquez emerged as a key figure in the investigation shortly after the Dec. 2 shooting. Officials said he bought the two rifles used by Mr. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, in the attack and in a gunfight with police hours later, during which they were killed. The FBI is probing the shootings as a terrorist act, saying it has found evidence that both shooters were Islamic extremists.                                         Investigators are looking into new evidence found on a Facebook post that could point to a motive behind the San Bernardino attacks that left 14 dead. WSJ's Devlin Barrett reports.

Less than a month earlier, the affidavit stated, Mr. Marquez had posted a description of himself on his         Facebook    account: “Involved in terrorist plots, drugs, antisocial behavior, marriage, might go to prison for fraud, etc.’’     “No one really knows me. I lead multiple lives, and I’m wondering when it’s all going to collapse on me,” he also said.     Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said Thursday’s terrorism charges stemmed from earlier plotting that didn’t result in any attack, not from the recent shooting.     Officials said while they haven’t found evidence indicating Mr. Marquez’s participation in this month’s attack, his gun purchases and failure to alert authorities had fatal consequences. In addition to buying the rifles, Mr. Marquez bought material used to build an explosive device found at the scene of this month’s attack, federal officials said.     The affidavit described Mr. Marquez as having fallen under the sway of Mr. Farook from virtually the moment he moved to Riverside and became his neighbor in 2005.     Almost immediately, Mr. Farook introduced Mr. Marquez to Islam, according to the affidavit, and the two began to pray frequently at Mr. Farook’s home. In 2009 and 2010, they began discussing more radical strains of Islam, and around that time Mr. Marquez began listening to speeches by radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, it said.     By 2011, Mr. Marquez was spending most of his time at Mr. Farook’s home, reading and watching radical Islamic lectures and material, including Inspire Magazine, which is produced by al Qaeda. Around that time, Mr. Farook told his neighbor that he wanted to join al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to the affidavit.                                                 A car carrying Enrique Marquez, a friend of one of the suspects in the San Bernardino shooting, arrived at U.S. District Court in Riverside, Calif., on Thursday. The FBI arrested Mr. Marquez on charges he conspired to support terrorism and acted as the straw buyer of two of the rifles used in the attacks.

The plan involved tossing pipe bombs into the cafeteria and shooting victims as they fled, officials said. They also discussed attacking a Los Angeles area freeway during rush hour, the affidavit said.     “After deploying the explosive devices, Farook planned to move among the stopped vehicles, shooting his rifle into them and killing people,” the affidavit said. “Marquez stated that he planned to shoot into the stopped vehicles from his position on the hills.”     The affidavit also described Mr. Marquez’s despondent actions following the shooting, detailing how on Dec.3, he showed up at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, frantic and telling medical staff he had consumed nine bottles of beer and was upset.     He was placed on an involuntary hold in the hospital’s psychiatric ward and told medical staff that he knew “the guy from San Bernardino.”     “I’m involved,” he told medical staff, according to the affidavit.     Mr. Marquez told investigators he originally purchased the two rifles used in the San Bernardino attack in late 2011 and 2012, and that he and Mr. Farook had planned to use them in their attacks on Riverside Community College and the freeway, the affidavit said     The criminal charges against Mr. Marquez included a charge that his marriage to the sister of Mr. Farook’s brother’s wife was a fraud intended to help her come to America.     A Farook family representative said Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were buried Tuesday “at a private funeral attended only by immediate family members” in a service described as “traditional” and “brief.”     —John R.
