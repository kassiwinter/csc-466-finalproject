    MANCHESTER, N.H.—Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on Wednesday praised Senate Democrats for blocking, at least temporarily, a bill that would give President         Barack Obama    authority to move trade deals through Congress.     Mr. O’Malley, who is expected to jump into the Democratic race for president later this month, renewed his criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Approval of the big trade deal between the U.S. and 11 Pacific nations would be eased by the so-called fast-track legislation.      “I’m glad the Senate slowed it down and I hope Congress will reject it if we can’t see it, read it and be assured this is good for workers and also good for our country,” he told reporters after chatting up the breakfast crowd at Chez Vachon, a restaurant that has long been a regular stop for White House aspirants.     “It’s also possible to conclude good trade deals,” he said, “but this one certainly smells like a bad one and would be a big mistake.”          The measure failed to advance in the Senate Tuesday, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin debate on the fast-track bill. Fifty-one Republicans and one Democrat -- Tom Carper of Delaware -- voted for it.     Unions and environmentalists, among others, have been campaigning against fast-track authority and the TPP.     Asked about Mrs. Clinton’s position on TPP, Mr. O’Malley said, “I don’t know where she stands on that.”     Mrs. Clinton's critics say she has failed to take a clear position one way or the other.     Considered the strong favorite to win next year’s Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton backed the trade deal as secretary of state, saying it would create “more and better growth.” But last month she was noncommittal. “Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,” she said.     Mr. O’Malley eagerly expounded on his own opposition to the deal. “The notion that we can somehow chase cheap labor abroad, send jobs abroad, and that helps our country, I think, is a falsehood we should wake up to,” he said. “There were many that had high hopes for Nafta back when we did that. Instead it caused a lot of dislocation.”     Instead, he said, “We need to focus on the things that make our own economy stronger, and more sustainable, and that create more jobs here at home.”     Mr. O’Malley has paid many visits to New Hampshire and Iowa, both important early-voting states. After Chez Vachon, he toured a business incubator in downtown Manchester. Other planned stops Wednesday include a state Democratic Party fundraiser and a house party.     At Chez Vachon, he only had to glance around to be reminded of Mrs. Clinton. Her framed picture hangs on one wall, as does a bumper sticker from her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign.     When he introduced himself to one group of diners as Maryland’s former governor, a woman at the table said with a laugh that she thought he was from South Carolina.
