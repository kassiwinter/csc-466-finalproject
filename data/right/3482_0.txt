                        	Getty Images                       Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal fixer, is parting ways with his legal team — which could be a sign he’s set to cooperate with the feds probing his business dealings.
Cohen will no longer be represented by Stephen Ryan and Todd Harrison of the firm McDermott, Will & Emery, according to reports Wednesday.
The lawyers, however, will stay on board through Friday — the deadline for them to complete a review of 3.7 million documents seized in an April raid on Cohen’s home and office. They’re determining which files should be withheld from Manhattan prosecutors under attorney-client privilege.
Cohen’s rift is over payment of legal bills of Ryan, according to The New York Times.
The split could signal a shift in legal direction — or that Cohen will cooperate with prosecutors, according to ABC News, which said that the latter development is imminent.
Cohen’s cooperation could spell bad news for Trump, his family and others in his inner circle. As the commander in chief’s personal lawyer, Cohen has handled some of Trump’s most sensitive matters, including the $130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged one-night stand with The Donald in 2006.
Cohen also has handled many of Trump’s business dealings since 2011.
Other news outlets, including The Associated Press and NBC, cited sources tamping down the possibility of Cohen cooperating, saying he hasn’t met with prosecutors.
The Daniels payment is among the business dealings that the feds are investigating as they determine whether to charge Cohen criminally.
Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told The Post that the legal shake-up is a “disaster” for Cohen.
“Months ago, I predicted that Michael Cohen would ultimately flip on the president and the president would be in great peril, and I think that’s exactly what’s going to happen,” Avenatti said.
