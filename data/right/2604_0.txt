In response to Democrat’s gun control protest in June, Speaker Paul Ryan has introduced a rules package that would fine any lawmaker who live-streams or records video while on the House floor. The proposed rule changes include a $500 fine for first time offenses, and $2,500 fines for any subsequent offense. The fine would be taken out of lawmakers' paychecks.
Over the summer, Democratic congressmen staged what Speaker Ryan had referred to as a publicity stunt. Liberals took to the House floor to protest a lack of gun reform. They wanted more background checks for gun users. When the House turned off its cameras during the sit-in, Democrats took to their phones to live-stream the event in order to keep up publicity. Ryan noted at the time Democrats were sending fundraising emails during the protest. “These changes will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people’s work,” Ryan spokesperson AshLee Strong stated.
Speaker Ryan and other Republican leaders had been discussing for some time possible punishment for those who took part in the event. The package is expected to be voted on January 3. If passed, the new rules can also lead to members being referred to the House Ethics Committee to face further reprimand for actions violating House decorum.
