Hunter Biden declined to challenge the authenticity of the laptop that prompted news reports and a subsequent blackout by big tech companies on Biden’s overseas business dealings and other affairs.Biden told CBS News’ Tracy Smith in an interview set to air on April 4 that he does not know if the laptop at the center of reports on emails between him and his business associates is his or not. The laptop also allegedly contained images of Biden using illicit drugs and engaging in sexual acts with an unidentified woman.“For real, I don’t know. I really don’t know what the answer is. That’s the truthful answer,” Biden told Smith in a clip of the interview released Friday by CBS News. “Of course, certainly [it could have been my laptop]. There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be I was hacked. It could be that it was Russian intelligence.”Months after it was alleged that a laptop revealed Hunter Biden's business interests in China and Ukraine, the president's son tells Tracy Smith that the laptop "could be" his Watch the full interview this weekend on #CBSSunday pic.twitter.com/DhtY5IcPeg— CBS Sunday Morning 🌞 (@CBSSunday) April 2, 2021Social media giants Facebook and Twitter took action in October to limit the spread of stories on Biden’s overseas business dealings while his father was running for the White House. Pundits, journalists, and experts dismissed the Biden laptop stories as Russian disinformation. Facebook limited the stories’ reach in order to fact check the claims.
