WASHINGTON—The Senate unanimously adopted an organizing resolution that sets the ground rules for a chamber evenly divided between the two parties and officially gives Democrats control of committees after two weeks of talks. In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader         Chuck Schumer    (D., N.Y.) said Democrats are “ready to hit the ground running” on         President Biden’s    agenda.

Senate Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell     (R., Ky.) said the deal is almost identical to a 2001 agreement and “will allow the Senate to be fairly run as an evenly split body.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Leaders of both parties had previously indicated they would use the Senate’s last power-sharing arrangement, in 2001, as a model. In that agreement, each party had an equal number of committee seats, but the majority party held committee chairmanships and controlled the agenda, setting the schedule for nominees and legislation to come to the floor for votes, even if committee votes were tied.     As in 2001, the Democratic and Republican leaders on Wednesday also entered a colloquy, or informal understanding, into the record. That colloquy addressed one of the final sticking points in negotiations: party leaders’ ability to “fill the amendment tree”—a process that restricts the offering of amendments.     In the colloquy, Mr. Schumer noted that over the past few decades, senators had been prevented from actively participating in the legislative process because their ability to offer and receive votes on amendments had been severely restricted. He committed “to increase dramatically the number of member-initiated amendments offered in the 117th Congress” and added that he is also opposed to limiting amendments by “filling the tree,” unless obstruction prevented the Senate from taking action, leaving leaders no alternative.      Initially, Mr. McConnell held up the resolution—which is typically a routine step—until Republicans got a commitment from Democrats to preserve the legislative filibuster, a Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation, giving members of the minority party influence of the Senate agenda. But he lifted his objection last week after moderate Democratic Sens.         Joe Manchin    of West Virginia and         Kyrsten Sinema    of Arizona reaffirmed their longstanding support for the filibuster.                                         Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona may have the most leverage with a Senate that's evenly divided between the two parties. WSJ’s Gerald F.

In some cases, Republicans who are term-limited for chairmanships still held the gavel. In other cases, committees had no chairs because of Republican retirements. The limbo also left freshman senators without committee assignments.     That made it hard for Democrats to get things done without either unanimous consent from all 100 senators or cooperation from GOP colleagues still running committees.     The setup created headaches for Democrats, stuck in negotiations with Republicans to hand over the keys to the Senate.     On Monday, Democratic Sen.         Dick Durbin,    the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked the outgoing Republican chair, Sen.         Lindsey Graham,    to hold a timely confirmation hearing for Mr.         Biden’s    nominee for attorney general,         Merrick Garland.         Although Mr. Graham has said he favors Mr. Garland, he denied Mr. Durbin’s request, saying in a letter that there wasn’t time for a thorough vetting before former President      Donald Trump’s        impeachment trial. Mr. Graham signed the letter “Lindsey O. Graham, Chairman, Judiciary Committee.”      After Mr. Schumer’s announcement of a deal on Wednesday, Mr. Durbin told reporters he wants to hold Mr. Garland’s hearing by Monday, but that might not be possible without Republican approval given that he’s required to give them a week’s notice.     Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial is scheduled to start in earnest in the Senate next week.     Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
