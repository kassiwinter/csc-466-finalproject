President         Biden    said he would nominate Federal Reserve Chairman         Jerome Powell    to a second term leading the central bank, opting for continuity in U.S. economic policy despite pushback from some Democrats who wanted someone tougher on bank regulations and climate change.Mr. Biden said he would also nominate Fed governor         Lael Brainard    as vice chairwoman of the central bank’s board of governors. Prominent liberals like Sen.         Elizabeth Warren    (D., Mass.) had warned the president against picking Mr. Powell, and progressive groups mounted a last-ditch campaign to pressure the president to tap Ms. Brainard for the top job. The announcement caps months of behind-the-scenes deliberations by Mr. Biden and his senior aides over one of the world’s most important economic policy posts at a time of high inflation and intraparty divisions.     The president’s decision reflected a desire by Mr. Biden to maintain stability at the central bank amid public concerns about high prices for everything from groceries to fuel, administration officials said. Mr. Biden’s advisers said they want to focus much of their attention on passage of their social spending and climate legislation and believe Mr. Powell will more easily win Senate confirmation, despite objections from progressives.           “Put directly: at this moment both of enormous potential and enormous uncertainty for our economy, we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve. Jay has proven the independence that I value in a Fed chair,” Mr. Biden said at the White House on Monday.     Stocks rose modestly after the White House announcement and ended the day little changed. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced less than 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.3%. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.625% from 1.535% Friday. Yields move inversely to bond prices.     Of the 84 lawmakers who voted to confirm Mr. Powell four years ago, 68 are still in office, equally split between the two party caucuses. Several lawmakers of both parties expressed support for Mr. Powell on Monday, including Sens.         Sherrod Brown    (Ohio) and         Pat Toomey    (Pa.), the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which will vote on the nomination.

They met with Mr. Biden separately at the White House on Nov. 4, and the president spoke with them about his decision on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Powell was backed for the job by several members of Mr. Biden’s economic team, including Treasury Secretary         Janet Yellen,    who served as Fed chairwoman from 2014 to 2018.     The president’s advisers are eager to avoid a drawn-out confirmation process that distracts from Mr. Biden’s broader legislative agenda. Throughout the deliberations, Mr. Biden’s team kept in regular contact with senators and their staffs to get their input, according to a person familiar with the process. He met at the White House with Ms. Warren on Nov. 9 to discuss the matter, and the president and his staff regularly briefed Mr. Brown, the person said.     The president, in his remarks at the White House on Monday, said Mr. Powell told him that he would make accelerating the Fed’s efforts to address the risks that climate change pose to the U.S. financial system a priority. “He’s also underscored the importance of the Fed taking a more active role in the months and years ahead in making sure that our financial regulations are staying ahead of emerging risks, be they from innovations and cryptocurrency or the practices of less regulated nonbank financial institutions,” Mr. Biden said.          Mr. Powell said he would work to address inflation.     “We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched,” he said at the White House event. “Other key priorities include vigilantly guarding the resilience and the stability of the financial system, addressing evolving risks from climate change and cyberattacks, and facilitating the modernization of the payment system while protecting consumers.”     Ms. Brainard, in brief remarks, said, “I’m committed to putting working Americans at the center of my work at the Federal Reserve.”     Mr. Biden can put his stamp on the central bank with three additional appointments. There is already one vacancy on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, and Fed Vice Chairman         Richard Clarida’s    term as governor will expire in January. The four-year term of the vice chair of bank supervision, previously held by current Fed governor         Randal Quarles,    expired in October and he plans to retire around the end of the year. Mr. Biden will announce those nominations in early December, the White House said Monday, likely prompting renewed efforts by progressive Democrats to influence the president’s picks.      Because some progressives were disappointed by Mr. Powell’s nomination, the White House faces greater pressure over who it chooses to fill those vacancies. They are especially focused on ensuring that the next vice chair of bank supervision is committed to tougher bank regulation and addressing climate change.      “While Jay and Lael bring continuity and stability to the Fed, my additions will bring new perspectives and new voices,” Mr. Biden said of his pending picks for the remaining Fed positions. “I also pledge that my additions will bring new diversity to the Fed, which is much needed and long overdue in my view.”     Ms. Warren reiterated her opposition to Mr. Powell’s nomination on Monday and said she would support Ms. Brainard’s nomination for vice chairwoman. She said the vice chair of bank supervision nomination is critically important.     “The position must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement—and it must be done quickly,” Ms. Warren said.     Two other progressive Senate Democrats, Sens.         Jeff Merkley    of Oregon and         Sheldon Whitehouse    of Rhode Island, said they would oppose Mr. Powell’s nomination.     Mr. Powell faces an especially delicate economic challenge as the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s response have sharply boosted demand and disrupted global supply chains, sending inflation to its highest levels in more than a decade.          He will have to lead his colleagues in the coming months through a debate over how soon to raise rates. The danger for the Fed is twofold: Officials don’t want to overreact by raising interest rates and cooling down the economy if supply-chain bottlenecks repair themselves over time. But they also don’t want to underreact as wages rise, fueling a more traditional inflationary cycle.     Mr. Biden’s announcement on Monday removes a key source of uncertainty over who might have to manage such a pivot should officials conclude that it is warranted.     Mr. Powell, 68 years old, is seen by supporters inside the administration and in markets as a steady hand whose extensive, personal outreach helped restore bipartisan support for the central bank one decade after its reputation was badly bruised by the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell, a former private-equity executive, was named to the Fed’s seven-member board 10 years ago by then-President         Barack Obama    and elevated to the chairman’s post four years ago by then-President      Donald Trump.             The political support Mr. Powell cultivated proved valuable throughout his term as chairman—first, when he faced steady attacks in 2018 and 2019 from Mr. Trump for raising interest rates, and later, when he led a rapid, aggressive response to douse a global financial panic triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.                                         Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described the outlook for inflation in the U.S. economy and said there are signs that prices that have moved up quickly should cease rising and retreat.

The Fed slashed interest rates to zero and then purchased trillions of dollars of government debt and offered to buy trillions more in loans and other assets to backstop credit markets.     Mr. Powell unveiled in 2020 a substantial shift in the way the central bank conducts interest-rate policy when he announced the Fed would set aside its practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflationary pressures and instead leave rates lower for longer to spur a faster recovery following downturns.     The shift reflected the Fed’s reassessment of the economy in 2019, when inflation didn’t pick up as policy makers expected it would with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest levels in 50 years. Mr. Powell navigated a policy U-turn from raising rates to cutting them while facing sustained criticism from Mr. Trump, who privately and publicly threatened to sack the Fed leader for not providing easier monetary policy.     At the beginning of this year, Fed officials were anxious to avoid a rerun of what followed the 2007-09 recession, in which weak growth forced the central bank to deploy novel measures to stimulate an economy in which short-term rates were already pinned near zero. But the reopening of the economy and a $1.9 trillion federal spending boost signed by Mr. Biden in March, on top of trillions of relief spending in 2020, fueled a larger-than-anticipated surge in consumer prices, which rose 4.4% in September from a year earlier, according to the Fed’s preferred gauge.     The Fed recently began shrinking its $120-billion-a-month bond-purchase stimulus program by $15 billion every month, a pace that could end the purchases around June. After that, the focus will turn to when and how quickly the central bank should raise interest rates from near zero.          Mr. Powell has to manage a group of 12 reserve bank presidents and up to six other governors who participate in rate-setting meetings. Several are growing more concerned that high inflation will persist, requiring the central bank to raise rates sooner or more aggressively than expected just a few months ago. Others are nervous about overreacting and have argued that pre-pandemic dynamics in which inflation, interest rates and global growth were historically low will eventually reassert themselves.     Mr. Biden’s political fortunes in the coming years may be tied to how Mr. Powell responds. If the Fed waits too long, Americans could face higher inflation for years or the central bank could be forced to raise rates aggressively, convulsing financial markets and putting the economy into a downturn. If it moves too fast or too soon, it risks prematurely slowing down hiring.     Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have argued that price pressures reflect bottlenecks from disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel. But Mr. Powell has warned in recent weeks that price pressures could also reflect stronger demand and that overwhelmed supply chains could lead to more persistent inflation than officials initially anticipated.     “We have to be in a position to address that risk,” he said at a Nov. 3 press conference. “We think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate.”     The Fed said last year it would hold rates near zero until it was confident inflation would run moderately above its 2% target and that labor markets were consistent with maximum employment. The unemployment rate has declined considerably this year, falling to 4.6% in October.      Fed officials want to conclude their bond-buying program before raising rates, so they would want to accelerate its wind-down if they decide they might need to lift rates before June. Two officials last week suggested they would deliberate such a path at their next meeting, Dec. 14-15.                                                  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who served as Fed chairwoman from 2014 to 2018, had backed Mr. Powell for the job.                  Photo:            michael reynolds/Shutterstock                                                                                                             Fed officials could raise rates either once they judge the labor market has largely recovered from the pandemic or if they conclude that the recent interval of high inflation is expected to last for long enough that it leads households and businesses to expect higher prices to continue, driving up wages and inflation as part of a more sustained cycle. The rate-rise process is often challenging for central banks and could be especially difficult this time because Mr. Powell over the past year has pledged to promote a more inclusive and broad-based recovery. Raising rates could lead to political blowback that the Fed is pulling back on those commitments.     In recent months, a range of current and former Democratic lawmakers along with progressive economists had spoken out in favor of extending a second term to Mr. Powell. They argued his skill transcending the polarization that has gridlocked much of Washington made him uniquely positioned to provide political support and intellectual backing for progressive policies that could elude even the most qualified Democrats.     “In this political environment, any other nominee would risk being perceived as a political choice,” said         Roberto Perli,    an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, a research firm in Washington. Mr. Powell had steered monetary policy in a direction “that is very much in line with the priorities of this administration, but he did so for sound economic reasons, not political reasons,” said Mr. Perli, a former Fed economist.     Mr. Powell navigated attacks from both Mr. Trump and Ms. Warren in “a high-wire act of political survival,” said         Marc Sumerlin    of economic-consulting Evenflow Macro. If the Fed raises interest rates to slow down the economy next year, “Biden may come to feel the same way as Trump, but the nation will be better served with continuity,” he said.

Mr. Powell’s leadership of the Fed faced new scrutiny in recent weeks because of financial disclosures by senior central bank officials that revealed extensive trading last year, when the Fed deployed unusual countermeasures against the pandemic.     The reputational crisis prompted two Fed reserve bank presidents to retire early. Mr. Powell announced in October a sweeping revamp of policies on how its leaders manage personal investments to minimize even the appearance of conflicts of interest.     A vocal minority of progressive groups pressed Mr. Biden to replace Mr. Powell with someone more committed to aggressive bank regulation and to using the central bank’s supervisory powers to address climate change. Some of them favored Ms. Brainard, an economist named to the board by Mr. Obama in 2014. She supported Mr. Powell’s monetary policy decisions while dissenting on moves to ease certain banking regulations.     Ms. Warren told Mr. Powell at a Sept. 28 hearing that she would oppose his nomination because of the Fed’s record of reducing regulations on banks in recent years. “That makes you a dangerous man to head up the Fed,” she said. Later, she cited the questionable trading activities by Fed insiders as a sign of failed leadership by Mr. Powell.     Other Democrats expressed concern that progressives’ priorities might further yoke the Fed to broader partisan warfare that the institution has largely avoided. They worried such moves could undermine its effectiveness on a new monetary policy strategy that has placed new emphasis on tighter labor markets.          Elevating Ms. Brainard to vice chairwoman represents a compromise of sorts between the two camps. The vice chair of the board, together with the New York Fed president, traditionally serve as the Fed chair’s top lieutenants in designing monetary policy. If confirmed, Ms. Brainard could take over as vice chairwoman next February.     Ms. Brainard has been strongly supportive of the Fed’s policy shift during Mr. Powell’s tenure and has generally advocated for delaying interest rate increases to avoid the risks of inflation being stuck below the central bank’s 2% target.     Mr. Powell has scheduled hundreds of meetings with lawmakers during his four years in office, and he remains well liked by politicians on both sides of the aisle.         Rep. Emanuel Cleaver    (D., Mo.) recalled inviting Mr. Powell to his district several years ago and introducing him to a cross section of rural Missourians and Kansas City residents.                                         The U.S. inflation rate reached a 13-year high recently, triggering a debate about whether the country is entering an inflationary period similar to the 1970s. WSJ’s Jon Hilsenrath looks at what consumers can expect next.                                                                                                     “There was no exception—everybody thought, ‘Hey, this guy is OK. He’s a straight-shooter.’ There’s nothing partisan about his presentation,” said Mr. Cleaver.     Mr. Powell drew on that political capital after the pandemic hit in 2020 to urge lawmakers to spend more money. “This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage…as possible,” he said in April 2020.     By that point, the Fed had already slashed rates to zero and was buying massive quantities of debt to stave off a financial meltdown. It also had unveiled lending backstops to businesses, cities and states that went far beyond anything the Fed had done during the 2008 financial crisis.     The unemployment rate, which stood at a half-century low of 3.5% in February 2020, soared in April 2020 to 14.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, as the economy was placed into the equivalent of a medically induced coma to restrain the spread of Covid-19. Unemployment steadily dropped.     The Fed’s response earned accolades from lawmakers—a contrast with the unpopular bank bailouts it arranged in 2008. “We all remember well spring of 2020, when the world economy almost melted down, and it didn’t in substantial part because of the actions that you and your colleagues took,” said         Sen. John Kennedy    (R., La.) in a July hearing. “You kept this thing in the middle of the road. Now, some days you had to do it with spit and happy thoughts, but you kept it in the middle of the road.”     —Ken Thomas contributed to this article.
