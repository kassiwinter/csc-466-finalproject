Taliban terrorists reportedly opened fire on a crowd in Afghanistan on Wednesday because the protesters insisted on waving the flag of Afghanistan.“A public display of dissent in the northeastern city of Jalalabad was met by an overwhelming use of force,” The New York Times reported. “Taliban soldiers fired into the crowd and beat protesters and journalists.”NBC News journalist Richard Engel tweeted: “Afghans demonstrate in Jalalabad in support of keeping Afghan flag (instead of white Taliban flag). Local media report Taliban fires on them, killing 2 and injured others.”WATCH (warning — contains graphic content):#Taliban open fire to disperse the protestors in Jalalabad city of #Afghanistan. pic.twitter.com/7UdRp9vbM0— Wajahat Kazmi 🏴 (@KazmiWajahat) August 18, 2021pic.twitter.com/QyqdOT2YUg— Najeeb Nangyal (@NajeebNangyal) August 18, 2021State-funded foreign media claimed that two people were killed and a dozen others were injured.The incident comes after Democrat President Joe Biden pulled U.S. forces out of Afghanistan in a widely criticized manner.The Taliban seized a significant amount of U.S. Military hardware and weapons that were given to the Afghan security forces for them to use in their fight against the Taliban.However, the Afghan security forces collapsed against the Taliban after the U.S. Military, under Biden’s leadership, pulled air support out of the country, which left the Afghan security forces unable to operate.The Wall Street Journal explained:The Afghan army fighting alongside American troops was molded to match the way the Americans operate. The U.S. military, the world’s most advanced, relies heavily on combining ground operations with air power, using aircraft to resupply outposts, strike targets, ferry the wounded, and collect reconnaissance and intelligence.In the wake of President Biden’s withdrawal decision, the U.S. pulled its air support, intelligence and contractors servicing Afghanistan’s planes and helicopters. That meant the Afghan military simply couldn’t operate anymore. The same happened with another failed American effort, the South Vietnamese army in the 1970s, said retired Lt. Gen. Daniel Bolger, who commanded the U.S.-led coalition’s mission to train Afghan forces in 2011-2013.“There is always a tendency to use the model you know, which is your own model,” Bolger said. “When you build an army like that, and it’s meant to be a partner with a sophisticated force like the Americans, you can’t pull the Americans out all of a sudden, because then they lose the day-to-day assistance that they need.”Biden blamed the Afghan security forces for their loss, claiming that they were “not willing to fight for themselves,” despite the fact that they have lost nearly 70,000 soldiers fighting the Taliban and other terrorists in the country.Related:McConnell Slams Biden’s Afghanistan ‘Embarrassment’: ‘Terrorists Around The World Are Cheering’Disturbing Footage Shows Extent Of Weapons Seized By Taliban After Biden’s Disastrous PulloutBiden Admin Tells Americans Trapped In Afghanistan It ‘Cannot Guarantee’ Their Safety To AirportSenate Dems To Seek ‘Full Accounting’ Of Biden Admin’s ‘Flawed’ Afghan WithdrawalWATCH: Psaki Refuses To Answer If Biden Admin Commits To Keeping Troops On Ground Until All Americans EvacuatedThis report has been updated to include additional information. The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.
