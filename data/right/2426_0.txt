                                                                                                                                         Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says part of Donald Trump’s foreign policy speech on Monday in Ohio will focus on the “war of ideas,” in addition to the need to fight radical Islamic terrorism.                                                                                                                                                      “I think maybe two big takeaways will be obviously he’s going to use the word radical Islamic terrorism, unlike the president and Mrs. Clinton,” Mr. Giuliani said on “Fox and Friends.”                                                                                                                                                      “But second, he’s going to talk about the war of ideas,” he said. “Not only are we not fighting the military war…but we’re not fighting the war of ideas.”                                                                                                                                                                    “We are not doing what we did during the Cold War,” he said. “We’re not proclaiming and sending into countries that disagree with us the values of our country, the values of our civilization.”                                                                                                                              “We’re not talking about what happens to women in these countries under Sharia law - how they’re stoned, and how they’re hurt, and how they’re harmed and how they’re misused,” Mr. Giuliani said.                                                                                                                                                                 “I’d like to hear Hillary Clinton talk about that,” he said. “She’s [a] so-called feminist, but she’s taken a lot of money from some of these countries. Maybe she can’t talk about [it.].”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In the speech in Ohio, Mr. Trump is expected to say that the U.S. is in an ideological conflict with radical Islam, is planning to call for a new ideological test for immigrants entering the U.S., and is expected to describe the need to temporarily suspend visa issuances to geographic regions with a history of terrorism and where adequate screening can’t occur, according to the Associated Press.
