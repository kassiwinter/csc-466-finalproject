 
Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis says 19-year-old bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still in stable but serious condition and has not been questioned yet.
"He’s in no condition to be interrogated at this point in time," Davis said on "Fox News Sunday." "He’s progressing, though, and we're monitoring the situation carefully."
When the suspect is well enough to speak, he will be questioned by a special high-value target interrogation team. Davis said he believes the imminent terror threat is over for now. Police have searched all the locations connected with Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with police Friday morning. Davis said any explosives found were disarmed or exploded.
He did suggest that the investigation is still wide-ranging and additional suspects or accomplices have not been ruled out.
"There may be other components of this investigation that will lead to charges down the road," he said.
The police commissioner said the older brother had traveled overseas and may have been involved with extremist views, but he couldn't say if Tamerlan Tsarnaev was, in fact the leader in the marathon bombing plot, as some media have reported. And Davis said that when the brothers began their rampage Thursday night, the police were not closing in on them.
"I think they decided to go active after their pictures were disclosed publicly," he said. "I think that’s what started the rampage."
