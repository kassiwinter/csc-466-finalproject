Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday demanded changes to “religious freedom” legislation that state lawmakers had just this week approved overwhelmingly, the latest turn in a cultural clash over whether such laws protect people of faith or open the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.The step-back by the Republican came as Indiana lawmakers worked to quell criticism from companies and some groups over a similar law that GOP Gov. Mike Pence signed last week. The sudden attention on these laws, which are surfacing in several other states and becoming an issue in the 2016 presidential race, reflects the collision of two forces: a movement seeking more legal protections for religious people and an accelerating drive to advance gay rights. “The issue has become divisive, because our nation remains split on how to balance the diversity of our culture with the traditions and firmly held religious convictions,” Mr. Hutchinson said Wednesday. He said the language of the bill must make clear that it isn’t the intent of Arkansas to discriminate.                                         Bills in Indiana and Arkansas meant to bolster religious freedom have ignited a national debate about the right of businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians. WSJ’s Jerry Seib explains why the conversation will not die down any time soon.

Mr. Moore said the state must ensure that it protects a person’s right to religious beliefs without sanctioning discrimination. “I don’t want to see us go down a road that causes us issues with job development and recruitment,” he said.               Those seeking religious protections say that while gays and lesbians have won greater acceptance, it is religious people who now face discrimination. They see their cause as gaining urgency as court decisions have favored the rights of gay and lesbian couples to wed.     Their political response, in part, has been to promote the so-called religious-freedom legislation at the state level. They say, for instance, that a band should be allowed to decline to perform at a gay wedding, because of religious objections, without fear of legal retribution.      “Religious freedom and religious liberty are increasingly marginalized and under assault in America,” said         Russell Moore,    president of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.                                         Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called for changes to the state’s religious-freedom bill following protests.

Related        But some legal experts say the Indiana and Arkansas measures are more expansive than those other laws. The Arkansas bill, for example, has a broader definition of religious exercise and allows those who claim to have been grieved to sue any entity under the law, even if that entity isn’t part of government.     People on both sides of the gay-rights issue anticipate that by June, the U.S. Supreme Court will declare a constitutional right to same-sex marriage that would legalize the unions in every state. In the meantime, gay-rights groups say the push-back against state measures will embolden them to push for antidiscrimination laws at the state and federal levels.      “By any stretch of the imagination we are now on the offensive here, whereas just a few days ago we were playing defense,” said         Fred Sainz    of the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington advocacy group.     Nearly half the states have some sort of legal protections for gays and lesbians. As a practical matter, if states don’t have these laws, businesses and individuals are free to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, even without a religious-freedom law. Neither Indiana nor Arkansas prohibits discrimination, though a handful of cities and counties in Indiana do.     In states that protect gays and lesbians from discrimination, it is unlikely that a religious-freedom law would make it possible to deny employment or services based on sexual orientation.     The state laws have drawn strong opposition from many corporations, which typically steer clear of contentious social issues. The chief executive of Arkansas’s own         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.    called on the governor to veto that state’s bill, while companies including         Gap Inc.,    Levi Strauss & Co. and         Nike Inc.    have opposed either the Arkansas or Indiana measure.     Retailers in particular have long tried to stay out of political issues. But many executives say corporate America largely sees the religious-freedom laws as a civil-rights issue that doesn’t have two sides. “Any form of discrimination is wrong,” said         Jay Stein,    chief executive of         Stein Mart Inc.,    a discount retailer based in Jacksonville, Fla.     The corporate response has drawn a backlash from some conservatives. On Wednesday, one leading social conservative,         Gary Bauer,    emailed some 200,000 supporters to slam “corporate insiders” who oppose these laws and to suggest their political alliance with social conservatives is at risk.      Meanwhile, on the national level, religious conservatives are seeking to have their views heard in the Republican presidential contest, where their political clout is significant. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who has said he is running in 2016, has fully endorsed the Indiana law. “Today we are facing a concerted assault on the First Amendment, on the right of every American to seek out and worship God,” he said.     Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ presumed 2016 front-runner, wrote Wednesday on Twitter that the Indiana and Arkansas laws go “beyond protecting religion.”     Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Ana Campoy at ana.campoy@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
