Rolanda Hollis introduced a mandatory vasectomy bill this week, send "the message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies." (Photo: Facebook/Rolanda Hollis)In response to last year’s near-total (and temporarily blocked) abortion ban in Alabama, a state legislator has introduced a bill that would require a man to undergo a vasectomy, at his own expense, “within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.”House Bill 238, introduced on Thursday by Rep. Rolanda Hollis (D) notes, “Under existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men.”The bill, Hollis says in a statement she shared with Yahoo Lifestyle, “is meant to neutralize last year’s abortion ban bill, and sends the message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies.” Further, she told AL.com, “It always takes two to tango. We can’t put all the responsibility on women. Men need to be responsible also.”The online backlash was swift, of course, with critics calling it “wrong,” “sick,” and “Communism,” although plenty of supporters got her point, and celebrated it, saying, “Ha! Stay out of my uterus!” and “Wahoo!”What the HELL is going on in AL?!Alabama Democrat Rolanda Hollis proposes a bill REQUIRING MEN OVER 50 or over to have a vasectomy...OR ANY MALE, ANY AGE, after their 3rd child!Hello China!COMMUNISM is being PUSHED in AL and VA, TEST STATES, people. https://t.co/Mf4SIQtk9G— Melanie Lauren (@Sweetemmilyn) February 13, 2020@realDonaldTrump rolanda Hollis is bringing a bill that would force men at the age of 50 to get a vasectomy.

(@AriesaSandino) February 14, 2020Hollis responded to some of the outcry by including in her statement: “Many have seen HB238 as an outrageous overstep; yet, year after year the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman’s body and her reproductive rights. We should view this as the same outrageous overstep in authority.”Abortion rights activists rallied in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, in May 2019 after the state of Alabama passed the country's most restrictive abortion ban.
