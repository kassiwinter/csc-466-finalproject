On Friday, a planned Donald Trump rally in Chicago was canceled after protestors swarmed the event venue. In a statement released by the Trump campaign, they said that the decision to cancel the rally was made after meeting with law enforcement.
According to the Chicago Police, this isn't true, and no threats were issued. Specifically, the police say they were "not consulted" until after the rally was canceled.
The Chicago Police Department said it was informed shortly before 6:30 p.m. that the Trump campaign had canceled the event. Police were not consulted before this decision was made, according to spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, and he said police did not issue any public safety threats or safety risks before the cancellation.
Strange.
