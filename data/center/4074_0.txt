WASHINGTON—         Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders    joined the burgeoning field of candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, vowing Tuesday to take on “the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life.”Mr. Sanders, who battled         Hillary Clinton    for the nomination three years ago and helped reshape the party, will return to the presidential stage with a loyal group of supporters and arguably the strongest online fundraising machine in Democratic politics. But unlike 2016, he will need to compete for the party’s most liberal voters in a large and unpredictable field vying to challenge President Trump. The independent senator announced his campaign in an email and a video posted on his         Twitter    account, telling his supporters, “Real change never takes place from the top on down, but always from the bottom on up.” He called Mr. Trump “the most dangerous president in modern American history.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      In a sign of the senator’s online fundraising clout, the campaign said he raised $3.3 million from 120,000 individual donors in the first 10 hours after his announcement. That was more than double California Sen.      Kamala Harris,        who raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours after she started her campaign.          Mr. Sanders is the sixth senator to seek the party’s nomination and is the 12th candidate to announce plans for a White House run. The field could grow even larger with the arrival of potential candidates such as former Vice President      Joe Biden        and former Texas Rep.         Beto O’Rourke.         The self-described democratic socialist will also serve as a bigger target for detractors. During his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump railed against the “new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” taking a shot at advocates for expansive government policies that include Mr. Sanders and Rep.         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez    (D., N.Y.), a prominent new member of Congress.     President Trump’s campaign responded to Mr. Sanders’s candidacy, saying in a statement that the senator “has already won the debate in the Democrat primary because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism” and that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will keep the country “free, prosperous and safe.”     Although Mr. Sanders isn’t registered with any political party, he caucuses with Senate Democrats, allowing him to be appointed to committees, and is running for president as a Democrat.     When he first ran for president, Mr. Sanders was largely unknown nationally, and few Democrats expected him to pose a serious threat to Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 primaries.     Surprising skeptics, he raised more than $230 million from 2.5 million donors and carried 22 states during the primaries.                                         Presidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows, but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains.                                                                                                     Now 77 years old, Mr. Sanders was the popular choice for Democratic primary voters under age 30 and served as the driving force behind a leftward push within the party on a number of policy issues that have become part of the party’s mainstream, including a Medicare-for-all health-care system, efforts to provide free college tuition for students, and dramatic steps to curb the effects of climate change, some of which has been embodied in the so-called Green New Deal.     This time, he will have plenty of competition.     Massachusetts Sen.         Elizabeth Warren    opened her campaign in late December and will be angling for many of the same voters who supported Mr. Sanders. Primary voters will also have more fresh-faced options to choose from such as Sens.         Harris,         Cory Booker    of New Jersey and         Kirsten Gillibrand    of New York. And Mr. O’Rourke, should he run, would compete for many of the same millennial voters who helped power Mr. Sanders’s campaign.     Some of Mr. Sanders’s 2016 allies, meanwhile, have moved on. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a top campaign surrogate for Mr. Sanders, is also seeking the Democratic nomination while Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the first Senate Democrat to endorse him, is also weighing a potential bid.      In his campaign launch, Mr. Sanders signaled he would continue to target the influence of the wealthiest Americans on the nation’s political and economic systems. In an interview with “CBS This Morning,” he warned of the potential independent candidacy of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.     “There are a lot of people I know personally, who work hard for a living and make forty, fifty-thousand dollars a year who know a lot more about politics than, in all due respect, does Mr. Schultz,” Mr. Sanders said. “But because we have a corrupt political system, anybody who is a billionaire, who can throw a lot of TV ads on television, suddenly becomes very, very credible.”      Mr. Sanders remains a prominent voice on economic issues and income inequality and has pressured corporations like         Amazon.com Inc.    to raise their wages. The senator praised Amazon last fall when the company announced it would raise the minimum wage it pays to all U.S. employees to $15 an hour and urged corporate leaders to follow the online retailer’s lead.     He has also helped influence the internal workings of the Democratic Party. The Democratic National Committee voted last year to strip from so-called superdelegates—which includes DNC members, federal lawmakers, governors and other party leaders—the right to vote on the first presidential ballot at the party’s national convention.     The changes came after Mr. Sanders and his supporters argued that the party’s superdelegates helped give Mrs. Clinton an insurmountable delegate lead before the 2016 national convention and reforms were needed to give primary voters a more central role.     His campaign will seek to create a larger and more diverse operation this time. The senator picked         Faiz Shakir,    a former aide to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi,        to manage the campaign. Mr. Shakir most recently served as national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Sanders’s campaign is also expected to include several advisers from his 2016 run.     Mr. Sanders has also dealt with internal problems from his last campaign. In January, he apologized after learning of allegations that some members of his 2016 staff had been sexually harassed by fellow staffers. He convened a private meeting last month to develop recommendations to improve workplace policies and told CBS in Tuesday’s interview that his campaign would have the “strongest protocols” to protect employees from harassment.         Related Reading        Mr. Sanders was elected to the Senate in 2006 after more than a decade representing Vermont in the U.S. House. The New York native ran multiple losing statewide campaigns in Vermont during the 1970s before winning a race—by 10 votes—to become Burlington’s mayor in 1981 and led the city for nearly a decade.
