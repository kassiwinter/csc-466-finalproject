LONDON—Prime Minister         David Cameron    swept to an unexpectedly strong election victory on Friday with a majority in Parliament, and immediately vowed to give more powers to Scotland and let voters have a say on whether to stay in the European Union.The clear win reshapes Britain’s political landscape, giving Mr. Cameron’s Conservatives the right to govern without the influence of a coalition partner and pushing out a generation of big-name politicians from the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. But it will also require Mr. Cameron to navigate tricky issues that could bring huge changes to Britain’s place in the world. The pro-independence Scottish National Partyemerged as a big force in British politics, presenting a strengthened challenge in keeping the U.K. together.      And despite his opposition to leaving the EU, Mr. Cameron had promised under pressure from some on the right of his party to renegotiate the relationship and hold the referendum by 2017 if re-elected.               “We will deliver that in-out referendum on our future in Europe,” Mr. Cameron, speaking after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where he informed Queen Elizabeth II that he would be staying on as prime minister.      In a sign of the success of the SNP, Mr. Cameron also promised to implement further devolution that all parties had agreed to for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. “In Scotland our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world, with important powers over taxation,” he said     He said the Conservatives would be the party of the working class and would represent the whole country: “Together, we can make Great Britain greater still.”     U.K. Election: Conservatives Win MajorityAfter a tense night of results, the U.K.’s Conservative party secures a majority at the general election.Outgoing opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, outgoing Liberal Democratic Party leader Nick Clegg and British Prime Minister David Cameron attend a VE Day service of remembrance at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London on Friday.Agence France-Presse/Getty Images1 of 18•••••     The Conservatives’ showing is a far different result than the dead heat predicted in months of pre-election surveys. With all of the 650 Parliament seats declared Friday, the Conservative Party had won 331 seats, more than the opposition combined and enough to rule without support from other parties. Labour had taken 232.      It is the first time the Conservatives have won a majority since 1992      The SNP won all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland, rolling to its best-ever U.K. election result. Not since 1918, which delivered a sweeping victory for Irish nationalists, has a party committed to its breakup held such sway in a part of the U.K.      Scottish voters last year rejected independence, but that campaign appears to have fueled the SNP’s meteoric rise on the back of a desire for greater autonomy. Their showing will amplify a noisy debate about whether Scotland should remain in the U.K.         Related                                            Results in the U.K’s general election continue to come in, with Britain’s Conservative party on target to meet exit poll predictions suggesting they will form the next government.

George Osborne,    a close ally of Mr. Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the outgoing government, identified the SNP’s triumph as the incoming government’s most significant challenge, and indicated a further transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament.      “We have to listen to what the Scottish people are telling us,” he said. “If we can find common ground, we will seek it. We’ve got legislation we can take through Parliament that would represent a considerable further devolution of powers.”      Despite the uncertainty ahead, the pound surged to its highest level in three months early Friday, and futures for the FTSE 100—the benchmark equity index of the country’s largest companies—were 1.8% higher.     Labour leader         Ed Miliband    stepped down after the party’s weakest performance since 1987 in terms of seats won. The party suffered some high-profile losses, including that of Ed Balls, the party’s spokesman on the economy and a former government minister.      “I take absolute and total responsibility for the result, and our defeat at this election,” said Mr. Miliband. “The party needs to have an open and honest debate about the right way forward.”                                                 Labour Party leader Ed Miliband announces his resignation in London on Friday.

At least four party members who had served as ministers in the coalition government lost their seats.      Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was one of the few in his party to retain a seat, resigned as its leader in the wake of the defeat, saying the results had been “immeasurably more unkind and crushing than I could have feared.”      The Conservatives focused their campaign on the party’s economic record, highlighting the U.K.’s recovery on their watch and accusing the previous Labour government of irresponsible spending. Mr. Cameron’s party also sought to attack its rival by portraying a Labour government as a weak one that would be propped up by Scottish nationalists.      Mr. Miliband had sought to position his party as one that would fight for the working class, arguing that many ordinary people were worse off after five years of a Conservative-led government, particularly at a time that prices have risen faster than wages.      The U.K. Independence Party, which had surged on its tough-on-immigration and anti-EU stance, took only one seat, down from two before the vote. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, who failed to win the seat he contested, stepped down as party leader, depriving UKIP of its most recognizable and charismatic face.      The seat is the first the party has ever won in a national election, but the result falls far short of the “few dozen seats” Mr. Farage had said he was targeting. The party saw its first two members voted in to Parliament late last year in special elections, after both candidates defected from the Conservatives.     In London, early results showed maverick Mayor Boris Johnson won a parliamentary seat, confirming him as a favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron as Conservative Party leader down the road.
