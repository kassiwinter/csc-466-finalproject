      	President Trump boasted about his “very good call” with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin — and slammed his media critics — in a Saturday tweet.
“Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia, despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media,” he posted while motorcading to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.
“Look how they have misled you on ‘Russia Collusion,'” he continued. “The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!”
Trump said Friday that he believed Putin “is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela” after his hour-long phone call with the Russian president — contradicting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s conclusion.
Trump also issued a warm tweet about Kim Jong Un, just hours after North Korea fired several short-range “projectiles” into the sea off its eastern coast.
“Anything in this very interesting world is possible, but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea, & will do nothing to interfere or end it,” Trump wrote. “He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!”
