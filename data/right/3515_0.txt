In @GStephanopoulos‘ exclusive interview with Pres.

Reports indicate Cohen is being investigated for possible financial crimes that may involve past dealings with the Trump organization and the president himself. Cohen also revealed that a joint defense agreement between himself and the president will be moot after he acquires a new lawyer. This agreement previously allowed for the sharing of all relevant information between the two parties. Trump and his team have worried for sometime that Cohen may began cooperating with federal investigators.
