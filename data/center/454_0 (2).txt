As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows," says Chris."When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. "As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. "9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. "I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."Chris adds: "I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."Posted at 15:40 10 Sep 2021Taliban control 'infuriating' on 9/11 anniversaryNew York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is “infuriating”
that the Taliban are “back in control” of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks.In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he “couldn’t get on active
duty fast enough” following the attacks.“I vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home – a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,” he said.Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a “path towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threats”.“Creating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistan’s borders,” he said. Posted at 15:25 10 Sep 2021WFP says 90% of Afghan households have food shortagesNine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned.Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, "the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled".The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September.An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m.Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments.Copyright: Getty ImagesImage caption: Pakistan has been delivering aidPosted at 15:14 10 Sep 2021US withdrawal 'pulled plumbing' out of Afghan forcesA former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the "stunning" retreat of US forces "pulled the plumbing" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as "a house of cards militarily and politically", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.Video contentVideo caption: Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a "house of cards"Posted at 14:59 10 Sep 2021Plea not to shun Afghan cricket over Taliban view on women's sportCopyright: Getty ImagesImage caption: Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that "cricket diplomacy" was preferable to a "knee-jerk" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the "cultural and religious environment" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on "Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us". A Taliban official earlier told Australia's SBS news that sport was "not necessary" and "in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered".Posted at 14:37 10 Sep 2021'The Taliban would have killed me'Video contentVideo caption: Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me'Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children.Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to "stand for the freedom of women".She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet.Posted at 14:10 10 Sep 2021BreakingSecond charter flight leaves KabulCopyright: EVNA second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha.It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities.It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday.

However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in "all strategic positions" in the province.Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul.One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as "normal".Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significantVideo contentVideo caption: Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in PanjshirPosted at 13:21 10 Sep 2021Traditional clothing sales on the rise in KabulCopyright: ReutersTraditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. "Our business has changed now," seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. "People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up.Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses."For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business.

We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying," Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan."We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families.But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan.Read more here.Posted at 12:16 10 Sep 2021UN's fears echoed by MI5 bossAs we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have "emboldened" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBC that while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a "morale boost" for extremists.Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres.In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies.Guterres said there was a "real danger" that some "terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death "is desirable", and that it was "essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel".Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadistsCopyright: ReutersImage caption: Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldenedPosted at 11:56 10 Sep 2021If you’re just joining us…Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan.

That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be," he said.Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported.On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries."Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this," he told a news conference in Moscow.Posted at 10:30 10 Sep 2021What's behind MI5's concerns?Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC NewsFor the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time.It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage.But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly.Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China.But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11.MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremistsPosted at 10:12 10 Sep 2021Live rounds, batons, whips. Taliban violence rising, says UNThe UN rights office says the Taliban have been "increasingly violent" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days.Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting "unauthorised assemblies"."Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs," the UN rights office said.

trauma," aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. "The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport.“They caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,” she told SBS News.While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban.Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban.Posted at 9:34 10 Sep 2021Pakistan in plea to avoid Afghan humanitarian crisisPakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed.It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital.On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator.Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: "We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."Anti-Pakistan protests have been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban.Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions.The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban.A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were "complete lies".Click here to read about what the rise of the Taliban means for Pakistan
