President Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, expressed his distress over the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va., and the controversy — much of it caused because of the president's response — that followed, in a candid interview published Friday by the Financial Times."Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK," said Cohn, who is Jewish.He continued: "I believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities. As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting 'Jews will not replace us' to cause this Jew to leave his job."Cohn said he felt "deep empathy" for the groups that had been targeted, noting that there must be unity against hate groups.Last week, the president doubled down on his belief that left-wing groups were just as violent as white nationalists and white supremacists who staged a rally in Charlottesville.As Trump made those comments during a press conference at Trump Tower, Cohn stood nearby.According to CNBC, Cohn's FT interview — which also tackled tax reform — was authorized by the White House in advance.Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that she didn't think anyone was surprised by Cohn's comments."He has not held back what his feelings are," Sanders told reporters.Asked whether he had considered resigning after Charlottesville, Cohn said he was under "tremendous pressure" both to resign and to stay in his job as the director of the National Economic Council. He said he was reluctant to leave — but added he had to speak out.The New York Times reported that Cohn had considered resigning and had drafted a resignation letter.Cohn also noted that his decision to stay was not influenced by last week's departure of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, with whom he clashed over administration policies."No, my decisions are my decisions," Cohn said. "I have to do what is best for me and my family. I have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic — I have not been bashful saying what I think."
