      The medical examiner for Hennepin County deemed George Floyd's cause of death a homicide.       The county's medical examiner listed Floyd's cause of death as "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression," meaning the autopsy deemed that the heart attack Floyd suffered was triggered by the manner of his arrest. The manner of death was listed as a homicide, which means that the death was caused by the intentional actions of another person.

Floyd died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being placed under arrest by Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin. During the arrest, Chauvin was filmed holding Floyd to the ground by kneeling on his neck.       Chauvin has since been fired from the department and charged with third-degree murder. Three other officers were also fired following Floyd's death. No charges have been filed against the remaining officers.      An independent autopsy conduct on behalf of Floyd's family contradicted the preliminary findings of the medical examiner, though they both concluded that Floyd died via homicide. The independent autopsy concluded that Floyd died of asphyxiation.
