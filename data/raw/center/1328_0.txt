The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman and the first Jewish person to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol as mourners paid their respects to the pioneering jurist who succumbed Sept. 18 to metastatic pancreatic cancer at the age of 87. Politics hung in the air of the ceremony honoring Justice Ginsburg, the de facto leader of the court’s liberal wing, whose death created a vacancy late in a presidential election year and spurred partisan fighting. President Trump will announce his nominee Saturday, and many Republicans want to fill the vacancy before the election, which Democrats oppose. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg: petite in size, monumental in impact,” said House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.).     The invitation-only service in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol, in which attendees were seated far apart from one another and all wore masks, commemorated Justice Ginsburg’s decades on the bench and her commitment to expanding women’s rights. Denyce Graves sang at the ceremony, a nod to Justice Ginsburg’s passionate love of opera that became a bridge over an ideological divide with late conservative Justice         Antonin Scalia.

Democratic presidential nominee      Joe Biden        and wife, Jill Biden, attended the ceremony, as well as vice-presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump paid their respects on Thursday when Justice Ginsburg lay in repose at the top of Supreme Court’s steps. The crowd below on the street chanted “vote him out,” one more sign of how the election is hanging over the nomination.

Susan Brooks (R., Ind.), who was one of a handful of Republicans in attendance, said that she began practicing law in 1985 and was cognizant of the way Justice Ginsburg had helped open doors for women.     “The way she paved the way for me as a lawyer and for so many women and all that she did in equal justice for women, I really wanted to pay tribute to her legacy,” she said afterward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R, Calif.) didn’t attend.      Lawmakers and guests filed past the casket after the ceremony, all wearing masks and staying far apart from one another. Justice Ginsburg’s physical fitness trainer, Bryant Johnson, dropped and did three push-ups. A few mourners brought their young children.           In 2005, civil-rights pioneer Rosa Parks lay in honor in the Capitol, a similar tribute for private citizens.     The late jurist’s casket departed the Capitol in the early afternoon from the steps facing the Supreme Court, flanked by more than 40 Democratic and Republican women lawmakers on both sides.      As the hearse drove away, a light rain began to fall and many lawmakers including Mrs. Pelosi waved goodbye. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D., Conn.) made the sign of the cross, while         Rep. Joyce Beatty    (D., Ohio) thrust her fist in the air.         Rep. Ayanna Pressley    (D., Mass.) wore a black mask that said “honor her wish,” a nod to the justice reportedly saying before she died that she wanted the president elected on Nov. 3 to be the one to fill the vacancy she left behind.      An interment service for Justice Ginsburg will be held next week at Arlington National Cemetery where the late jurist’s husband, Marty Ginsburg, is buried.                                                 Members of a military honor guard Friday carried the casket of Justice Ginsburg into the Capitol to lie in state.                  Photo:            Michael A.
