WASHINGTON—Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas never shrinks from staking out solitary ground in Washington, and Tuesday marked no exception.Wearing black tennis shoes in lieu of his customary boots, the Republican took to the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon in front of a handful of lawmakers and vowed to speak until he was "no longer able to stand" in resistance to President         Barack Obama's    health-care law. It technically was just a long speech that stretched late into the night—not a filibuster—and couldn't significantly delay a Senate vote expected Wednesday. But Mr. Cruz's defiant stand exemplified his unyielding brand of conservatism that, less than a year into his Senate career, has fueled speculation that he might run for president.           Related Articles           His latest push, which seeks to tie government funding to an effort to dismantle the health overhaul, represents the biggest test of whether Mr. Cruz's conservative rhetoric can upend the ways of Congress. This week's campaign has exposed the limits of his strategy's appeal.               Mr. Cruz has attracted few backers among his colleagues. Senior Republicans including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Texan John Cornyn split from his strategy this week, as other GOP lawmakers warned it could backfire.     "Defunding Obamacare is a goal all Republicans share, but the tactics we employ in achieving that goal can have a backlash," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) told reporters. "The problem with our conference is that most people's only concern is a primary, so we tend to forget about those on the front lines of expanding the party."     The Senate is expected soon to vote on a bill passed by the House last week that would keep the government running in the next fiscal year and also eliminate funding for the health law. Mr. Cruz said he would aim to block the bill because Democrats are expected to remove the health-care provisions. Currently, he doesn't have the votes to pull off that move.     "A great many Americans feel they don't have a voice and so I hope to play some very small part in helping provide that voice for them," said Mr. Cruz, criticizing other lawmakers for what he said amounted to ignoring constituent complaints about the law.     Some Republicans worry Mr. Cruz's push could make it harder for GOP lawmakers to secure their next goal: a one-year delay in implementing the health-care law that they plan to attach to a one-year extension of the federal borrowing authority, whose limit is otherwise expected to be hit in mid-October. Their concern is that Mr. Cruz's efforts are muddling the GOP message, a senior House Republican aide said.     Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, said on the Senate floor Tuesday that this week's debate should have shone a light on Democrats and made them reiterate their support for a health law that many Americans don't support or don't understand.                At a weekly luncheon of GOP senators Tuesday, most Republicans pressed to speed up debate on the spending bill so that it could return to the House in time for Republicans there to add other GOP-backed provisions to the measure and volley it back to the Senate."Delaying the opportunity for the House to send something back, it seems, plays right in the hands of Senate Democrats," Sen.         Bob Corker    (R., Tenn.) told reporters Tuesday.     Mr. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) didn't agree. The Texan took to the Senate floor shortly after the lunch, saying "there are politicians in this body who are not listening to the people, not listening to the concerns of their constituents."     Mr. Cruz found himself at odds with even a frequent ally, Sen.         Rand Paul    of Kentucky, who argued at the meeting that the GOP should speed up the debate, according to senators in the meeting. Mr. Paul later appeared on the floor with Mr. Cruz.     This week's budget showdown is only the latest skirmish that has peppered Mr. Cruz's tenure. His supporters say his determination to wage certain fights is more important than whether they end in legislative victory. "This is a huge issue and it's worth fighting for even if you lose," said Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Mr. Cruz sees "Washington for what it is," said Mr. DeMint, a former GOP senator from South Carolina.      If Mr. Cruz strikes a lonely figure at times in Washington, his efforts have elevated him to the stature of folk hero at home. Texas Republicans, said Steve Munisteri, chairman of the state's GOP, "will still be happy with him if he loses, as long as he wages the fight."
