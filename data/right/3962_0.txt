  Stocks posted a dramatic late-session turnaround Thursday, lifting all three major indexes from big declines into a positive close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a 865-point swing in less than two hours. The blue-chip index had been down in mid-afternoon more than 500 points to cut the previous session's gains in half, before bargain hunters and short covering turned a big decline into a modest gain.The Dow, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all posted their largest two-day percentage gains since Aug. 27, 2015.However, on a month-to-date basis the averages remain down: The Dow is 9.74 percent lower and year-to-date it is down 6.75 percent. Most of Thursday's session saw stocks in negative territory with the decline in equities broad based -- all 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were down for much of the day as were all 30 components of the Dow. Before the late-session turnaround, the S&P 500 was headed for its worst month since February 2009. The Nasdaq was on pace for its worst month since November 2008, and also on pace for its eighth 2-percent-or-more down day in December.The downdraft stemmed from several causes: Worries about the health of the global economy, concern about possible future interest rate hikes, anxiety over the effects of the U.S.-China trade war; and turmoil in the Trump administration.Thursday's volatility followed a massive gain on Wednesday when the Dow rose more than 1,080 points, or nearly 5 percent, marking the first time in history the exchange rose more than 1,000 points in a single day of trading. The S&P 500 climbed more than 100 points, or about 5 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 360 points, or nearly 6 percent.Volume was slightly below the month-to-date average.Crude oil prices extended their losses, with the benchmark West Texas Intermediate tumbling 3.85 percent to $44.44 before trimming the declines. Since Oct. 1 the price of WTI has fallen nearly 40 percent.Ticker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 34988.84 +422.67 +1.22%SP500 S&P 500 4471.07 +69.40 +1.58%I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 14139.757317 +348.84 +2.53% European markets returned to trading following the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays to trade lower.
