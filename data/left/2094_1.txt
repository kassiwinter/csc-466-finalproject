President Barack Obama reminded Americans to honor the sacrifices of military families in his annual Christmas address."Every day, the brave men and women of our military serve to keep us safe -- and so do their families," he said.He was joined by First Lady Michelle Obama, who, along with Vice President Joe Biden's wife Dr. Jill Biden, has made supporting military families an administration priority through their Joining Forces initiative."Together, we can show them just how grateful we are for their sacrifice," she said. "That’s a tradition we all can embrace -- today and every day."The president also urged Americans to provide others with "love and compassion" this holiday season and help people "on society's margins.""Today, like millions of Americans and Christians around the world, our family celebrates the birth of Jesus and the values He lived in his own life," Obama said. "Treating one another with love and compassion. Caring for those on society’s margins: the sick and the hungry, the poor and the persecuted, the stranger in need of shelter -- or simply an act of kindness." "That’s the spirit that binds us together -- not just as Christians, but as Americans of all faiths," he added. "It’s what the holidays are about: coming together as one American family to celebrate our blessings and the values we hold dear." Obama taped the address at the White House last week, before the family departed for their yearly Christmas vacation in Hawaii.Watch the president's address above.Also on HuffPost:Sasha, Malia, Michelle & Barack Obama
