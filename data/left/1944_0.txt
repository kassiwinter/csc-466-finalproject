The Fox debate moderator stands her ground in Trump dust-up.— -- Megyn Kelly broke her silence on her Fox News show tonight, responding to attacks by presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said he believes Kelly treated him unfairly during last week’s GOP presidential debate that she co-moderated.On "The Kelly File” tonight, Kelly said "I felt he was asked a tough but fair question."The question that sparked the Kelly-Trump dust-up was whether Trump's attack on the physical appearance of some women was appropriate for someone hoping to win the White House."Mr. Trump has decided to not apologize and I certainly won't apologize for doing good journalism," she said.After complaining about his treatment at the first GOP presidential debate, Trump told CNN of Kelly, "You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes ... Blood coming out of her wherever."Many people believe Trump was referring to Kelly’s menstrual cycle. But in an interview with ABC News’ "This Week" Sunday, Trump reiterated his earlier clarification that the "wherever" reference was to her nose.“I have nothing against Megyn Kelly,” he said. "She asked me a very, very nasty question."Top Stories
