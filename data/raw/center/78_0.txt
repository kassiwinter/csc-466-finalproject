California will require presidential candidates to hand over their tax returns in order to appear on the state’s primary-election ballot, setting up a likely legal conflict with President Trump over his continued refusal to disclose any tax documents.Under a law signed Tuesday by         Gov. Gavin Newsom,    candidates must turn over five years of tax returns at least 98 days before the March 3 primary. The state would then release a redacted version of the documents. “These are extraordinary times and states have a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards, and to restore public confidence,” Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.     The case is likely to land in federal court, joining two other cases over the president’s tax returns.

Join the conversation below.        “The state of California’s attempt to circumvent the Constitution will be answered in court,” said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president.               Legal experts have said that states may be barred from adding qualifications to the Constitution’s age, citizenship and residency requirements for presidential candidates, based on the Supreme Court’s rejection of state laws imposing congressional term limits in 1995. But states do have more control over presidential elections than congressional elections.      States are allowed to limit ballot access by requiring candidates to pay filing fees or gather a certain number of signatures. They couldn’t, however, require that candidates be Protestant or Midwestern, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who focuses on election law.      “This looks a little bit like something in between,” she said. “Because anybody who wants to can release their taxes.”     The California law applies only to the primary, not the general election, and that may become a key legal distinction. If Mr. Trump doesn’t appear on the California primary ballot but he wins the Republican nomination, his name would still be on the state’s general-election ballot in November 2020.     Mr. Trump lost in California in 2016, getting less than 32% of the vote. And the overwhelmingly Democratic state is not expected to be competitive for him next year.                                         Before departing the White House on a Texas trip in mid-April, President Trump explained why he won’t share his tax returns.

Newsom should have listened to the concerns of his predecessor, Gov. [Jerry] Brown, who vetoed it two years ago,” said Jessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California Republican Party, in a statement.     Mr. Brown in his 2017 veto message said that he worried the law might be unconstitutional or that it could lead to other, unwarranted requirements for candidates.     “I think it’s very uncertain whether it’s unconstitutional or not,” said         Rick Hasen,    an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “I would not bet on it surviving.”     During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns. He didn’t, breaking a 40-year tradition among major-party candidates and presidents.     Democrats have been trying to pry them loose since then. The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee requested the returns in April, using a statute that lets that panel’s chairman obtain any taxpayer’s returns. But the Treasury Department refused the request and a subsequent subpoena, arguing that they lacked a legitimate legislative purpose and were thus outside of Congress’ constitutional powers. The House then sued, and the case is in federal court in Washington.     New York state took a different approach, passing a law that would let the Ways and Means Committee get Mr. Trump’s state tax returns. Mr. Trump then sued to block the committee from getting those documents.     —Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.
