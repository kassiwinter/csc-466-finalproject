John McCain on Sunday urged Republicans not to filibuster new gun control legislation. "I don’t understand it. The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand," he said on CBS' Face The Nation. "I would not only encourage it, I don’t understand it. What are we afraid of?"Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has vowedhas vowedo filibuster gun control. Paul has referred to the bill as "oppression of a government." A dozen other senators have promised to join Paul, who also filibustered John Brennan's confirmation as CIA director.McCain said that filibusters silence the crucial discussions that take place around legislation."Why not take it up and amend it and debate? The American people would profit from it. I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate when the leader has said we can have amendments," he said. The Arizona senator did not say whether or not he would support new background checks provisions.“It really depends on how they’re carried out, how long, what the depth of it is," he explained.Watch McCain's full appearance in the video above.The Strongest Conservatives In Congress
