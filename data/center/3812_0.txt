The U.S. defense secretary on Friday approved a request to deploy additional U.S. troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, fulfilling President Trump’s vow to use the American military in an expanding campaign to stop a caravan of migrants and asylum seekers.The military deployment is part of a new round of administration action on immigration that includes a threat by the Trump administration to seal border entry ports to migrants, including asylum seekers. The latest moves were seen by both supporters and opponents as an escalation of the administration’s confrontational stance on immigration, striking political and legal nerves around the country.      The new troops likely will come from active duty military units instead of the National Guard, a U.S. official said, and will arrive in so-far unspecified border locations next week.               Defense Secretary         Jim Mattis    approved the request, which was submitted by the Department of Homeland Security, for the troops to augment an existing force of approximately 2,000 National Guard members sent last spring.     The move came as a caravan of thousands of migrants—currently more than 1,000 miles from the border and moving northward—has drawn Mr. Trump’s ire.     Mr. Mattis’s orders don’t specify how many troops would be assigned to the border, instead directing the Pentagon to determine what military personnel are needed and how to fill the request, the U.S. official said.      The Pentagon expects to announce which troops would be selected to deploy in the next two days, the U.S. official said.     In comments at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he “called up the military” to attend to the influx of illegal immigrants at the border. “We’re not letting them in,” he told attendees of the Young Black Leadership Summit. “They’d better go back now. Now, do we want them to apply and come in legally? Absolutely.”                                         President Trump said the U.S. will end Central American aid as thousands of migrants march toward the U.S. border. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why this might be counterproductive.

According to a Pentagon statement about the deployment, the troops will support border agents and the Department of Homeland Security by providing “aviation support to move [Customs and Border Protection] personnel, medical teams to triage, treat and prepare for commercial transport of patients, command and control facilities, temporary housing for CBP personnel and personal protective equipment for CBP personnel.”      In addition, troops will build temporary barriers, barricades and fencing, the Pentagon said.     Critics charge that when U.S. active duty troops are assigned such tasks, they are not focusing on—or training for—their primary job, defending the U.S. from external threats.      “What that means is that      Donald Trump        is mobilizing the military to be a bunch of gophers and movers for border patrol and DHS, which is a gross misuse of our military,” said Will Fischer, director of government relations for VoteVets, a pro-Democratic advocacy group. “For the president to take them away from training affects mission readiness.”     The move to send troops emerged this week as an issue in the hard-fought Texas Senate race.         Rep. Beto O’Rourke,    the Democratic hopeful, said Mr. Trump was stoking fears about immigration, while his rival, incumbent GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he supported the president’s plan to increase security as migrants moved toward the U.S.      Homeland Security Secretary         Kirstjen Nielsen    said her agency is consulting with the Defense Department on options for the use of the troops along the Mexican border, including what equipment would be most effective at preventing people and vehicles from illegally crossing.     “All options are on the table,” Ms. Nielsen said at an event near the Calexico, Calif., port of entry on Friday. She was there to show off 2 miles of newly built border fencing made of 30-foot high steel posts.     The number of troops deployed will be determined by the Defense Department, Ms. Nielsen said. An administration official said a previously reported figure of 800 troops was “premature” and that the Pentagon is rethinking the number.      In addition to temporarily sealing ports of entry along the border to migrants, other options under consideration include a reinterpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives the president authority to implement immigration restrictions through proclamations.     The particular statute being examined “is very vague and has never, ever been used or thought about in the way this president has thought about it,” a former Department of Homeland Security lawyer said.      Asylum cases are governed by international treaty and U.S. statute, and procedures for processing individuals typically have been straightforward. However, as Mr. Trump looks to defend his immigration crackdown on the basis of national security interests, a reinterpretation of the immigration act could provide room to alter the rules.     “It has incredibly broad powers,” the former official said. “And the fact is that nobody has tested the limits of it.”     A border closing would deny protection to people who can prove they will be persecuted if they return to their country, said         Omar Jadwat,    of the American Civil Liberties Union. “We are going to take a very close look at it and all options, including legal ones,” he said. “This country should not be in the business of denying asylum to people who have legitimate claims.”     The administration official said that U.S. officials have been reassured by Mexico’s efforts to control caravan movements and that U.S. officials favor teaming with Mexico on the issue.     —Alicia A.
