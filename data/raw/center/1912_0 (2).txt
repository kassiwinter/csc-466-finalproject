Iran is widely expected to use part of the billions of dollars freed up by sanctions relief under the newly minted nuclear deal to aid regional partners hostile to Washington and its allies. But with the threat of extremist group Islamic State redrawing old battle lines in the Middle East, the Iranian and U.S. camps sometimes find themselves fighting a common enemy. Iran hopes to leverage better relations with the U.S. and other Western nations to secure closer cooperation against common threats. Foreign Minister         Javad Zarif,    who played a central role in negotiating the nuclear deal agreed on Tuesday, claimed in a recent address that his country was at the forefront of the fight against extremism.      “I hope my counterparts will also turn their focus and devote their resources to this existential battle,” he said.               One Western diplomat echoed the sentiment, saying last month “sometimes it’s a good thing” Tehran is using its muscle to back those fighting Islamic State.     Iran stands to reap more than $100 billion under the nuclear deal, as assets in foreign countries frozen by sanctions flow back into its coffers. Valiollah Seif, the head of Iran’s central bank, said Wednesday that $23 billion of the bank’s money is blocked in Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Within 4 to 5 months, he said, Iran should be reconnected to the SWIFT network, which facilitates international banking transactions.     U.S. intelligence analysts expect Tehran to use some of the imminent windfall to step up support for its closest friends in the region including the Syrian regime, Shiite militias in Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon.                                                                                                                                                      Most of those allies are currently taken up with battling Islamic State, opening up potential avenues for broader U.S.-Iranian cooperation and reconciliation built on the foundation of the nuclear deal. But the nexus of alliances across the Middle East presents many complications for a thorough realignment of the balance of powers.      Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    said Tuesday that Iran would soon be on the receiving end of “a cash bonanza” that would allow it to continue “aggression and terror in the region and the world.”     Members of the U.S. Congress have raised similar alarms about the extent of Iran’s support for regional allies.      “With tens of billions of sanctions relief cash likely coming, Iran now wants free rein to arm Hezbollah terrorists, assist Assad in Syria and aid Houthi rebels in Yemen,” Rep.         Ed Royce,    Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said last week.     Iran gives vital support to President         Bashar al-Assad’s    regime in Syria, which is fighting Islamic State but is also at war with Western-backed rebel groups such as the Free Syrian Army, or FSA, in the multi-sided war. His regime is sometimes accused of turning a blind eye to the Islamist radicals because they buffer between his forces and opposition fighters like the FSA.     Once focused on anti-Israeli efforts, the Islamic Republic has largely redirected its efforts to groups fighting Islamic State, which has captured wide swaths of Syria and Iraq and come within 40 miles of Iran’s western border with Iraq.     Iran also aids Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is directly involved in the Syrian war on the side of the regime and which fought a war with Israel in 2006.      And it helps Shiite militias in Iraq roll back gains against the Sunni militants of Islamic State there—perhaps the clearest example of the U.S. and Iran fighting on the same side. Both countries are actively providing military support and aid to Iraqi forces fighting Islamic State.     Iranians fear they could be the next target of the Sunni extremists.         Related Coverage        In a study last year, the Institute for International Energy Studies, an Iranian government research center, warned of Islamic State’s “advancement to Iran’s borders and [of] possible disruption in oil field production and development in western Iran.”     Meanwhile, Iran has also been reducing its support to the most hard-line Palestinian factions, notably to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, according to Western officials. The group lost Iranian assistance over its refusal to offer political support to Iran’s allies in Yemen and Syria and is now struggling with cash shortfalls, one of these officials said.               Daoud Shehab,    a leader of Islamic Jihad, acknowledged that the organization has been struggling with financial difficulties lately because of the upheaval throughout the region, particularly in Syria.      “After what has been happening recently with Arab countries and Iran, the financial situation is more complicated,” he said, without elaborating. “They are busy with the situation in the region.”     Tehran has also cut assistance to Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian faction that governs the Gaza Strip and fought a war with Israel last summer, one Western diplomat said.     Concern that the government will deploy freed-up funds to support its allies has grown with the completion of the nuclear deal, Western diplomats say. But despite that worry, most of the money is expected to go to address an array of domestic economic ills, according to U.S. intelligence officials.     Iran has 50 incomplete major government projects that require an estimated $37.5 billion of funding, including roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. The cash could fund the revival of ventures such as a 75-mile highway connecting Tehran to Caspian Sea vacation spots.     It could also sate demand for American and European imports, such as airplane parts and oil and gas extraction equipment.                                                                                                                                                     Congress still has to weigh in on the nuclear deal, and lawmakers will need assurances that Israel, the target of many Iranian allies, won't be in danger as a result.              Peter Harrell,    a former top sanctions official at the U.S. State Department, said he expects only a small part of the sanctions relief to benefit regional allies. But that could still pose a threat to the U.S. and its Mideast allies.     Iran’s most expensive ally is Syria, which receives about $6 billion a year from Iran,         Staffan de Mistura,    the United Nations envoy to Syria, estimated last year.      However, invoices and letters seen by The Wall Street Journal offer some new insights that suggest Iran keeps a tight leash on how money sent to Syria is used. One invoice showed the Syrian regime drew $409 million of shipments from an Iranian state-owned oil company to its Syrian counterpart over a six-month period in 2013. Iran kept tabs on each cargo and of its commercial value in great detail.     Another document seen by the Journal shows Iranian institutions have been making it difficult for Syria to draw on its credit lines. In the letter sent in 2013 and marked “Top Secret/Top Urgent,” an Iranian state bank signaled it was reluctant to make a transfer unless its Syrian counterpart didn’t provide the right documentation and justifications.     And in talks last year, Iran considered Syrian requests for a $150 billion budget for reconstruction as overestimated by $50 billion, according to a Western diplomat familiar with the conversations.     Iranian support for Hezbollah is smaller in scale but still significant, according to people familiar with its operations.      Iran recently scaled back assistance in both weapons and cash, according to a Western diplomat who tracks the militant group. But the lifting of sanctions would enable Tehran to open the spigots once more.     —Aresu Eqbali and Adam Entous contributed to this article.
