 The numbers are in, and they're huge. Team Romney raised $111.6 million in August. The Romney campaign, RNC and state party partipants now have $168 million cash on hand with 57 days to go before Election Day 2012. Announcing the numbers, Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said, “Americans are not better off than they were four years ago and they are looking for a change of leadership. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are offering bold solutions to our country’s problems – that is why we are seeing such tremendous support from donors across the country. We will continue the hard work of raising the resources so that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can win in November, put in place their Plan for a Stronger Middle Class, and finally get the country back on the right track.”  More numbers: 94.11% Of All Donations Received In August Were $250 Or Less
$34.6 Million Raised By Donations Under $250 In August
822,223 Donations Received Under $250 In August
Approximately $168.5 Million Cash On Hand
Contributions Received From All 50 States And Washington, D.C. The vast majority of donations aren't coming from big time donors as the Obama campaign has charged, they're coming from everyday Americans. It turns out Paul Ryan was an excellent choice for Romney as his vice presidential nominee, not to mention a cash cow, too.
