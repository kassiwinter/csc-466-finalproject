President Trump mocked the testimony of         Christine Blasey Ford    during a political rally Tuesday night, aiming direct public criticism at her for the first time while expressing broader frustration at sexual misconduct accusations facing men at all levels.“It’s a damn sad situation,” Mr. Trump said in Southaven, Miss. Mr. Trump had been advised not to criticize Dr. Ford and had displayed restraint after her testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee—an emotional, measured appearance that drew bipartisan praise, even as many Republicans said they didn’t believe that Supreme Court nominee         Brett Kavanaugh    was Dr. Ford’s attacker as she alleges.     But Tuesday night, Mr. Trump criticized gaps in Dr. Ford’s retelling of her sexual assault at a house party in a Maryland suburb of Washington in the early 1980s.               “How did you get home?” Mr. Trump asked, mimicking a questioner during last week’s hearing that also featured a defiant Judge Kavanaugh.     “I don’t remember,” Mr. Trump said in mock response of Dr. Ford.     “How’d you get there? I don’t remember. … Where is the place? … I don’t remember. … How many years ago was it? I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said, the crowd cheering.     “Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know. But I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember.”                   Michael Bromwich,    one of Dr. Ford’s lawyers, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s comments were “a vicious, vile and soulless attack,” adding: “Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well? She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice.”     Last week Mr. Trump said he found Dr. Ford’s testimony was “very compelling” and that she was a “very credible witness.” His depiction on Tuesday of Dr. Ford’s testimony didn’t always keep in line with what Dr. Ford said during her Senate hearing.     Dr. Ford couldn’t recall certain details, but she testified that she clearly remembered that people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house and that she went upstairs to use the bathroom and that she was pushed into a bedroom where the assault took place and that someone in the room turned up music. She testified that she was “100 percent” certain that Judge Kavanaugh was her attacker, an allegation he vehemently denies, and that he and a friend, Mark Judge, laughed. Mr. Judge has said in a letter submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee he has “no memory of this alleged incident.”     Mr. Trump bluntly added Tuesday night: “And a man’s life is in tatters. A man’s life is shattered. His wife is shattered.”     Mr. Trump invoked accusations he has faced. “For me it’s like part of the job description,” he said. “Let it happen to me. Shouldn’t happen to him.”     He then appeared to turn to the #MeToo movement, which has toppled numerous high-profile men, starting with         Harvey Weinstein,    over the past year.     “This is an important time for our country,” Mr. Trump said, bemoaning situations in which a husband, father, brother or son can face false accusations of “horrible” things and lose their jobs.     —Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.
