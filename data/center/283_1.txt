LEXINGTON, Va.—The U.S. must work more actively to shape the new governments created by the Arab Spring, GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said Monday, seeking to contrast his foreign-policy approach with President Barack Obama's.In a speech focused tightly on the Middle East, Mr. Romney said he would spend more on the American military, take a tougher line with Iran, impose conditions on foreign aid and work to ease tensions between the U.S. and Israel. "It is time to change course in the Middle East," he said at the Virginia Military Institute, in his 10th foreign-policy address of the campaign. "The president has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need."     But while Mr. Romney was critical of Mr. Obama's handling of the Middle East, many of his general policy recommendations didn't differ markedly from the president's.

Related Reading           The GOP candidate at times seemed to veer from his previous statements. He said he would "recommit America" to the goal of a Palestinian state. In a secretly recorded speech at a fundraiser this year, Mr. Romney had voiced skepticism about prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace, saying it probably would remain an "unsolved problem."                A spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington declined to comment on the remarks.      When Mr. Romney did offer specifics, his prescriptions often were similar to Mr. Obama's approach.     Iran has "never posed a greater danger," Mr. Romney said. But mirroring the Obama administration, he proposed tighter sanctions on Tehran. On Syria, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had "failed to lead," but the GOP nominee didn't back direct arms transfers to the rebels.     "There isn't much differentiation between what he would do and what Obama is already doing or said he would do," said Karl Inderfurth, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington foreign-policy think tank, and a former State Department official. "The rhetoric is tougher, in many respects, but the policy prescriptions are quite consistent between the two candidates."     Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state who supports Mr. Romney, said stark differences on foreign policy are uncommon. "You can't reinvent foreign policy from administration to administration," Mr. Kissinger said. "But I think there's an emphasis on coherence."     Mr. Romney is focusing on foreign policy after sensing an opening in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Mr. Romney also seized on Mr. Obama's comment last month that political friction in the Middle East represent "bumps in the road" in the development of democracy.     In his speech, Mr. Romney pointed to a broad strategy for Afghanistan that echoes Mr. Obama's: to work toward a security handover to the Afghans by the end of 2014. But Mr. Romney signaled he could be open to a slower drawdown than the dates given by the White House.     Mr. Romney made scant mention of China on Monday, though his campaign views it as a key area of difference with the president. Mr. Romney has promised, if elected, to label China a currency manipulator and he often assails Mr. Obama's approach to dealing with the country as too soft.     The Obama campaign responded Monday by saying Mr. Romney's foreign policy was confused and vague, and that he offered no specifics on how he would handle global hot spots. "This is somebody who leads with chest-pounding rhetoric," said Jen Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman. "He's been clumsy at his handling of foreign policy."                                                                                             Obama and Romney on the IssuesRead where President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney stand on major issues affecting the U.S.                                    Mr. Romney was harsh on Mr. Obama's handling of the conflict in Syria, saying he has been weak on responding to a crisis in which civilians have been killed, extremists have joined the fight and Turkey, an ally, has been attacked. But both men have avoided pledging to supply U.S. arms, instead advocating aid and indirect help to the rebels.      "So many of these people who could be our friends feel that our president is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity," Mr. Romney said.      The GOP candidate argued that the White House fundamentally misunderstood the layered challenges the U.S. faces in the Middle East when it first cited a web video that insulted Islam as a possible cause for the consulate attacks. "They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East—a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century," he said.      And in his clearest terms yet, Mr. Romney blamed the Benghazi consulate attack on al Qaeda, something Mr. Obama hasn't done.     But at times Mr. Romney's policy toward the emerging democratic governments in the Middle East appeared contradictory. For instance, he said the U.S. should launch a new Marshall Plan for the region, so that new governments don't fall back into despotism and poverty.      At the same time, Mr. Romney said he wants to tightly "condition" any economic assistance for Egypt, the largest and most important of the new governments to emerge from the so-called Arab Spring. The country's new president, Mohammed Morsi, hails from the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement, which has historically been critical of U.S. foreign policy.     "In Egypt, I'll use our influence—including clear conditions on our aid—to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel," Mr. Romney said. "And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid."     The Obama campaign said that Mr. Romney made it sound like he was setting new conditions for aid to Egypt when he was simply restating U.S. policy.     Rehashing one of his most critical attacks on the Obama administration's foreign policy, the Republican candidate called Mr. Obama soft on efforts to contain Tehran's nuclear work. "Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability," Mr. Romney said.     He was short, however, in offering ways to end the nuclear threat that were differed markedly from Mr. Obama's. Mr. Romney said he would continue to ratchet up economic sanctions on Tehran, something Mr. Obama has also done. One of the few specifics Mr. Romney offered in his speech to contain Iran was restoring a permanent aircraft-carrier battle group in the Eastern Mediterranean and one in the Persian Gulf region, arguing that Mr. Obama hasn't kept a regular presence in the region.                                         Mitt Romney criticized the White House's handling of the crisis in Libya and fleshed out some of his own foreign-policy positions in a speech Monday, Sara Murray reports on the News Hub. (Photo: AP)                                                                                                     The Republican candidate promised to restore cuts to military spending as he blamed Mr. Obama for a bipartisan deal that could result in severe cuts to military spending. But in doing so, he risked the threat of muddying his commitment to deficit-cutting.     "I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military," Mr. Romney said. "I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure."     Mr. Romney's defense plans would boost spending by an estimated $2 trillion over the next decade. On Monday, he said he would call on allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to devote 2% of their gross domestic product to security spending.     That longtime goal was pursued under both the Bush and Obama administrations, but has faded as the European financial crisis worsened and it became clear countries were unable to pay.     Mr. Romney has offered only surface details of how he would pay for the massive defense tab. Perhaps the most significant cost-saving measures Mr. Romney has unveiled—changes to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare—aren't designed to kick in for another decade. By that point he has promised that the budget will already be in balance.      Mr. Romney also said he would appoint an official to better coordinate aid in the Middle East. The Obama administration's attempt to establish a common fund to aid emerging democracies in the region was left unfunded by Congress.     —Jay Solomon, Laura Meckler and Carol E.
