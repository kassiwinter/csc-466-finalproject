“Christ is the King,” tweeted Spicer, who will be Trump’s press secretary. “He was born today so we could be saved. Its [sic] sad & disappointing you are politicizing such a holy day.” Spicer’s tweet — and related remarks on CNN — followed several hours of angry back and forth on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms over whether the RNC’s holiday message was suggesting the president-elect was a figure comparable to Jesus Christ.
This was the controversial passage: “Merry Christmas to all! Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind. Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King.”
The RNC’s three-paragraph statement, issued in the name of Reince Priebus and Sharon Day, made no mention at all of Trump. But that didn't stop folks from arguing over the statement — and possible notions of blasphemy — between discussions over the passing of singer George Michael, the health of actress Carrie Fisher, and an emphatic dunk by Richard Jefferson in an afternoon NBA game.
