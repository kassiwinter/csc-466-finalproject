PANAMA CITY, Panama—The leaders of the U.S. and Cuba planned to hold their first meeting in more than 50 years on Saturday, a milestone signifying the two nations’ intensifying efforts to restore full diplomatic relations.The expected sit-down between President         Barack Obama    and Cuban President         Raúl Castro    at a gathering of leaders from the Americas marks the American leader’s bid to reshape U.S. relations with a longtime adversary—even as he faces resistance to his similar effort with Iran. More than a historic milestone for two Cold War rivals, the encounter is symbolic of the broader shift in U.S. foreign policy that Mr. Obama is aggressively executing in his second term.     “This is not just about two leaders sitting down together. It’s about fundamentally changing how the United States engages Cuba,” said         Ben Rhodes,    one of Mr. Obama’s closest foreign-policy advisers, who helped lead secret talks between Washington and Havana.               Messrs. Obama and Castro shook hands Friday night during a dinner for leaders at the summit. White House officials said there wasn’t a substantive discussion.                                         President Barack Obama is nearing an expected decision to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of governments that sponsor terrorism, a step that would smooth over a major point of contention between the two countries.

Images of two leaders together in Panama are set to ripple across the globe little more than a week after the U.S. announced the outlines of a diplomatic agreement with Iran to curtail its nuclear program.     Mr. Obama’s goals for diplomatic outreach to Iran and Cuba, in the short term, diverge. On Iran, the aim is to keep its leaders from acquiring a nuclear weapon. With Cuba, Mr. Obama is seeking to unravel a policy of isolation he believes has failed.     Both pursuits could significantly reshape the geopolitical dynamic in their respective regions, and Mr. Obama hopes his policy of engagement will usher in more-open societies in both Iran and Cuba over the long term.      His efforts face significant obstacles: There is deep mistrust between the U.S. and the Cuban and Iranian governments, as well as opposition in Congress from Democrats and Republicans to engaging either nation.     “President Obama’s foreign policy has been one of appeasement toward autocratic dictators, thugs and adversaries,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Friday.                                                                                                                                                     Opposition in Congress to Mr. Obama’s engagement with Cuba isn't as intense as it is on Iran. Lawmakers are pursuing a veto-proof majority for legislation that Mr. Obama says would derail a nuclear deal with Tehran. Polls also show a majority of Americans back better relations with Cuba.     Since Messrs. Obama and Castro announced in December that their countries would fully restore diplomatic relations, efforts to normalize relations have slowed, however, including the opening of embassies in Washington and Havana.     One of the chief obstacles has been Havana’s demand that the U.S. remove Cuba from its list of nations that sponsor terrorism. Mr. Obama signaled this week that he is on the verge of announcing his decision to do so.     Cuban officials have said they want the U.S. to take further steps, including a full lifting of the U.S. embargo, which would require a vote in Congress, and a handing over of the American military base at Guantanamo Bay.     The U.S., for its part, still has problems with Cuba’s handling of political and human rights issues.     The White House expects Congress to move first on lifting a ban on Americans’ traveling to Cuba, followed by the rolling back of some agricultural measures, although the timing of those moves is unclear.     The White House increased its outreach to the Cuban government in advance of an expected meeting between Messrs. Obama and Castro during the Summit of the Americas, which Cuba is attending for the first time since its inception in 1994.

Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro arrived in Panama with a petition signed by 10 million Venezuelans demanding the U.S. drop the sanctions.     Messrs. Obama and Castro spoke on the phone Wednesday, discussing the terror designation and the eventual opening of embassies in Washington and Havana, among other topics, White House officials said.      It was only the second time the presidents of the two countries have spoken since Cuba’s 1959 revolution. The other time was in December.     The phone call preceded a lengthy meeting Thursday night between U.S. Secretary of State         John Kerry    and Cuban Foreign Minister         Bruno Rodriguez    at a Panama City hotel.     The White House announcement of the meeting plans marks the latest twist in a turbulent relationship between the two countries that stretches back to before the Cuban War of Independence, which became the Spanish-American War, which gave birth to the modern Cuban nation in 1902.     U.S. political and economic dominance over Cuba in the following decades generated complicated views of Washington on the island nation. Havana’s close relationship with the U.S. helped Cuba progress economically and create one of Latin America’s highest standards of living. But the unequal relationship with the U.S. also generated nationalist resentment which was used by Fidel Castro to fuel a revolution that overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959.     Over the five decades that Fidel Castro and now his brother Raul have governed, about 1 million Cubans out of a population of 11 million have left the island and now live in the U.S.     Renewed ties with the U.S. under Mr. Obama once again offer Cuba, which is struggling economically, the promise of extensive business and travel ties to a country that is just 90 miles from Florida.     Already the rapprochement smoothed the way for U.S. sales to Cuba of some goods and services such as telecommunications equipment and travel. Tourism to the island jumped 14% in recent months, according to Cuban government statistics, boosted, in part, by U.S. visitors.     Foreign investors—from farmers in the American South to cruise-ship lines and bankers—are gearing up to invest. Marcel Smits, the chief financial officer of U.S. agricultural giant Cargill Inc., told a business leaders’ summit in Panama on Thursday that his company is lobbying Congress to lift the embargo.               Francisco Aristeguieta,    the chief executive of Citigroup in Latin America, said Citibank would be among the first U.S. banks to return to Cuba if Congress acts.     Similarly, in his outreach to Iran, Mr. Obama has also emphasized the potential of economic gains to Tehran.      U.S. officials say their policy goal in Cuba isn't regime change. Mr. Obama said Thursday that he doesn’t anticipate his simultaneous outreach to Iran and Cuba is too heavy a lift.

The ramped-up U.S.-Cuba engagement has placed Mr. Obama in a crosscurrent of praise and criticism, as has been the case with his outreach to Iran.     His policy shift on Cuba has been warmly received by leaders across the region and removes the biggest stumbling block to better relations. This week, Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller told Mr. Obama he was “on the right side of history.” A poll taken in Cuba showed Mr. Obama was more popular than its own leaders.      But Mr. Obama has had to contend with human rights activists and Cuban dissidents who strongly oppose his engagement with the Castro dictatorship.     Mr. Obama met with civil society leaders from across the Americas, including dissidents from Cuba, on Friday.     On Thursday, members of civil organizations from other countries in Latin America said the members from Cuba’s official delegation disrupted the forum.     As the summit began Friday, Cuba’s political police were also reportedly arresting dissidents in Havana.      “They keep violating the accords they signed and they keep jailing people,” Wilberto Parada, one of the 53 political prisoners Mr. Castro released as part of his agreement to normalize relations with the U.S., said in a telephone interview.
