Republicans and Democrats are trying to use the coming fight to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat to motivate their bases, with each side arguing that it would be catastrophic to let the other party pick her replacement. In a fundraising email Saturday, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris said Americans needed to hold the GOP to the standard that party applied in 2016, when Mr. McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings for President Obama’s pick to replace conservative Justice         Antonin Scalia,    who died earlier that year.                                         President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden comment on the death of Justice Ginsburg.

And there is no doubt in my mind that      Donald Trump        will nominate someone who will overturn the Affordable Care Act, strip protections from immigrants, overturn Roe v. Wade, and more,” the email said.          A Biden aide said the former vice president would emphasize the future of health care, saying it is an issue that motivates Democratic voters. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments on the Obamacare law on Nov. 10, one week after the election.     Mr. Trump said Saturday that he will name a woman next week to replace Justice Ginsburg on the Supreme Court and that Republicans had an obligation to act without delay to fill the seat. Mr. McConnell didn’t say in his Friday statement whether he would hold a confirmation vote before Nov. 3.                                                 In a fundraising email Saturday, Kamala Harris said President Trump would ‘nominate someone who will overturn the Affordable Care Act.’                  Photo:            Olivier Douliery/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             The early messages showed how Justice Ginsburg’s death could reverberate on the campaign trail. Mr. Biden leads in polls nationally and in many battleground states, and he has so far tried to make the election a referendum on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The president, for his part, has said a Biden presidency would be too liberal for many Americans.     Mr. Biden isn’t expected to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, the aide said. The former vice president promised to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if he faced a vacancy.          Some Republicans hope that the court fight raises the stakes of the 2020 election for suburban voters, some of whom switched parties to vote for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Both parties are eager to win over suburbanites this year.

Wade, the 1973 ruling that recognized abortion as a constitutional right. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey in June 2019 found record high support for legal abortion—56% said it should be legal all or most of the time, while 41% said it should be illegal in all cases or with some exceptions.     In 2018, there were signs that the fight over Justice         Brett Kavanaugh’s    confirmation to the high court about a month before the midterms helped motivate GOP voters who weren’t as enthusiastic about that election as Democrats.

It’d make the actual nominees the focus of the debate through Election Day,” said Charlie Gerow, a Republican strategist in Pennsylvania. “I think it energizes his base, but it also is comforting to suburban voters who may not have voted for Republicans in the midterms. They’ll see the contrast between the far left of Joe Biden and the more sensible center-right of Donald Trump.”              Sen. Mike Braun    (R., Ind.) said he thought the 2018 fight to confirm Justice Kavanaugh had motivated the GOP’s party faithful, helping him get elected that year.     “The proof’s in the pudding for us. It clearly helped two close races,” he said in an interview Saturday. “We know our base will go out and do it. Whether theirs will or not, who knows?”              Sen. Thom Tillis    (R., N.C.), who faces a tough re-election battle against Democrat         Cal Cunningham,    said Mr. Trump would name a “well-qualified and conservative jurist,” while Mr. Biden would choose a “liberal activist” to join the court. Mr. Cunningham said that North Carolinians have already begun voting—absentee ballots went out early this month in the battleground state—and that the next president and Senate should fill the vacancy.        
The Death of Justice Ginsburg        Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster who works on the Wall Street Journal/NBC News surveys, said the biggest impact could be felt in Senate races such as the North Carolina matchup. Mr. Horwitt said Democratic challengers would paint incumbent GOP senators as hypocritical if they supported Mr. McConnell’s plan to vote on a Trump nominee.     “There could be a real price to pay should they support the exact opposite position weeks out from Election Day 4 years later,” Mr. Horwitt said in an email. “This is particularly the case for suburban women and college-educated women who were keys to Democrats taking back the House in 2018 and may end up doing the same in 2020 for the Senate.”     There are early signs Democrats see the vacancy as a voting issue. In the hours after the announcement of Justice Ginsburg’s death, a record amount of money poured into Democratic candidates and causes through ActBlue, the progressive fundraising platform. More than $6.2 million was raised on ActBlue during the 9 p.m. Eastern hour on Friday, a record hourly amount for the platform until $6.3 million was raised in the 10 p.m. hour. The previous hourly record was $4.3 million in an hour on Aug. 20, the final night of the Democratic National Convention, an ActBlue spokesperson said.     The outpouring of donations made Friday the best fundraising day on the platform this month with nearly $35 million raised for candidates and causes, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis of ActBlue’s running donation ticker.     Republican fundraising platform WinRed doesn’t make similar figures available.     —Ken Thomas and Chad Day contributed to this article.
