WASHINGTON—President Biden mounted an ardent defense of his decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, standing by the plan amid rapid gains by the insurgent Taliban, signs of strain on the Afghan military and grim forecasts from U.S. military and intelligence officials.Mr. Biden said Thursday that the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan is on track to end on Aug. 31, arguing that the U.S. had achieved the objectives it set out two decades ago and adding that his administration would move thousands of potentially endangered Afghan interpreters out of the country next month. “We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. It’s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country,” Mr. Biden said, making the case that the U.S. had degraded the terrorist threat in Afghanistan.      Noting the more than 2,000 American deaths during the war, Mr. Biden said it was time to leave. “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no expectation to achieve a different outcome,” he said.          The Taliban has taken over swaths of the country and confiscated military equipment the U.S. left behind for its Afghan partners. And the Afghans have complained of the U.S. handover of its largest military base, known as Bagram, a departure that they said was completed without adequate consultation or advance notice.                                                  The U.S. military has withdrawn from Bagram Air Base, the centerpiece of its operations in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years.

Bush    during a 2003 speech when he proclaimed the U.S. had prevailed in Iraq. “The mission was accomplished in that we got         Osama bin Laden    and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” Mr. Biden said.      But he appeared to acknowledge that the future of Afghanistan was uncertain. “The mission hasn’t failed—yet,” he said.     Mr. Biden expressed confidence that Afghan forces can counter the rise of the Taliban in the country. Asked if a Taliban takeover was inevitable, Mr. Biden said, “No, it is not,” adding, “I trust the capacity of the Afghan military.”     Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) called on the Biden administration to put in place a clear plan to advance the rights of women in the country and protect translators and other allies of the U.S. in Afghanistan.     “I’m very encouraged by President Biden’s efforts to get our Afghan allies out of harm’s way, but I remain deeply concerned by the deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan,” she said. “Sadly, this follows a trajectory that I feared: a resurgence of the Taliban and direct threats to communities vulnerable to their violence and oppression.”                                         Propaganda footage appears to show Taliban forces guarding a U.S.-built border crossing between Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

The translators moved out of Afghanistan could be in those countries for years as they await a valid U.S. visa.     Officials estimated the number of Afghans who assisted the U.S. and who need to be evacuated at between 9,000 and 16,000. Advocates for the interpreters and others said they wanted additional details.     “President Biden’s announcement, to evacuate interpreters from Afghanistan into third countries, does not reassure us unless they provide specifics of how they will do it, and the data backs up their claims,” said James Miervaldis, board chairman of No One Left Behind, which works on behalf of Afghan and Iraqi interpreters.

A number of Republican lawmakers criticized Mr. Biden’s refusal to leave behind a small contingent of combat troops.     “A catastrophic collapse of security in Afghanistan, potential loss of life, and the reemergence of safe havens for terrorists who will threaten our homeland as well as our partners and allies, is predictable, but not inevitable,” said         Sen. Jim Inhofe    of Oklahoma, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding the U.S. needed more troops there to heighten security.     In recent weeks, the Taliban has taken over scores of districts, with control of roughly one-third of the country. And while on average two translators have been killed each month this year, there are no clear indications that the Taliban is targeting translators in districts they have overrun.     In a statement released last month, the Taliban said translators who showed “remorse for their past actions” would be allowed to live safely within Afghanistan.     “If they are using ‘danger’ as an excuse to bolster their fake asylum case, then that is their own problem and not that of the Mujahideen of Islamic Emirate,” the statement said.                                                 President Biden met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah last month.

During President         Ashraf Ghani’s    visit to Washington last month, the U.S. promised to provide Afghanistan with about three dozen Black Hawk helicopters and a small number of A-29 Super Tucano aircraft to boost its beleaguered forces, a U.S. official said.     Mr. Biden’s remarks from the White House on Thursday came days after the U.S. military withdrew from Bagram Air Base, the centerpiece of American military operations in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years.     He met earlier Thursday with his national security advisers to receive an update on the withdrawal.     Mr. Biden decided in April to remove all American forces from Afghanistan except for about 650 troops at the Kabul airport and the U.S. Embassy. All other forces will depart Afghanistan by the end of August, Pentagon officials said.     A longtime critic of the war effort, Mr. Biden has argued that there is no longer a reason for forces to remain in the country, saying the U.S. had achieved its goal of preventing attacks on the nation from being planned in Afghanistan. He recently said that a “rational drawdown with our allies” was under way, adding that he thought Afghans had the capacity to maintain the government.     In recent weeks, Afghan soldiers have handed over their weapons and Humvees to the Taliban, who now surround several major cities. A recent U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Kabul could fall to the Taliban as soon as six months after the U.S. military pullout is completed this summer.     Gen. Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has warned of the potential for a civil war in the country following the departure of U.S. forces.     —Catherine Lucey and Michael R.
