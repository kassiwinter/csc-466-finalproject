                 | September 20, 2019 06:54 PM                 The Pentagon is sending additional troops and missiles to Saudi Arabia in response to Iran's attack on Saudi oil facilities last weekend.       "The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which are primarily defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense," Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a surprise briefing Friday night. "We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves."             "We are contributing to Saudi Arabia's defense. We would be looking, as the secretary said, for other international partners to also contribute to Saudi Arabia's defense," Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford added.       Neither official would say how many troops the United States is providing, but the number will likely be in the hundreds. Nothing is happening immediately, and Dunford said he will present more specifics next week.       "Despite repeated calls from President Trump to begin diplomatic talks, Iranian aggression continues to increase," Esper said. "In the face of this sustained malign behavior, the United States and other countries have demonstrated great restraint in hopes that Iranian leadership would choose peace and reverse Iran's steep decline into isolation and economic collapse."       Esper condemned the strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities as a "dramatic escalation of Iranian aggression."       He confirmed that U.S. investigators are "on the ground in Saudi Arabia" and that "all indications" are that Iran was responsible for the attack, which was made with cruise missiles and drones.       Houthi rebels took credit for the strikes, which disrupted 5% of the world's daily oil supply, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday there is "no evidence the attacks came from Yemen."       President Trump said in a tweet Sunday that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to retaliate against whoever was responsible, adding, "There is reason to believe we know the culprit."       Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned Thursday that any attack against Iran in response to the strikes would lead to "all-out war."       "While the foreign minister of Iran is threatening an all-out war and to fight to the last American, we are here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and peaceful resolution,‚Äù Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded.       Trump announced new sanctions targeting Iran's central bank Friday morning.
