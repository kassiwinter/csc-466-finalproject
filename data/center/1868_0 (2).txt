NEW YORK—         Hillary Clinton    used the first public rally of her presidential campaign to align herself with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, saying she wanted to ease income inequality and would push for expanded paid family leave, universal preschool and other liberal priorities.At her rally on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton sought to make an asset of her long experience in public life, which has been spotted with controversies, casting herself as someone well-equipped to stand up for her policy causes.                                          In her debut campaign speech June 13th on Roosevelt Island, Hillary Clinton quips about potentially being the youngest woman president, and tells how her mother taught her to keep fighting.

Related stories        “You know by now I’ve been called many things by many people,’’ she told the crowd. “Quitter is not one of them.”      Mrs. Clinton’s speech, to a crowd of thousands on New York City’s Roosevelt Island, marked an effort to reintroduce her to voters two months after formally starting her White House campaign. During that time, she has continued to face questions about foreign donations to her family’s charitable foundation and about her exclusive use of a private email account to conduct official business as secretary of state. Her campaign appearances have often been before small audiences.               After her remarks on Saturday, she was joined on stage by her husband, former President         Bill Clinton,    who did not address the crowd but watched from the audience in a bright red polo shirt.     Mrs. Clinton said she would push for a range of policies at the forefront of the Democratic agenda, including paid family leave and universal preschool—a continuation of her effort to endear herself to the party’s energized left flank.                                                  Thousands attended Hillary Clinton's rally on Roosevelt Island in New York City on Saturday.

The opponents include Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s only rival for the Democratic nomination now in Congress.     Mrs. Clinton on Saturday said nothing to clarify whether she supports or opposes the trade deal.     She used the address to denounce Republican rivals—though none by name—especially on social issues such as gay marriage.     In response, Allison Moore, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, said after the speech that the address “was chock full of hypocritical attacks, partisan rhetoric and ideas from the past that have led to a sluggish economy leaving too many Americans behind. Next year, Americans will reject the failed policies of the past and elect a Republican president.”                                                 Chelsea Clinton and Bill Clinton were present at the rally.

Martin O’Malley, weighed in with a critique that painted Mrs. Clinton as part of a creaky Washington establishment.     Bill Hyers, a senior strategist for Mr. O’Malley, said: “Democrats, and in fact, our nation, will not make progress with status quo thinking. We need someone who can bring new leadership, strong progressive values and a record of getting things done to the White House, and that person is Martin O’Malley.”     Mrs. Clinton’s speech took aim at hedge-fund managers and CEOs who she said were reaping most of the benefits of economic growth, saying the top 25 hedge-fund managers earn more than all the nation’s kindergarten teachers combined. But she did not say what policies she’d adopt to address income inequality. In the coming weeks, she said, she would detail policy prescriptions that “reward businesses who invest in long-term value rather than the quick buck—because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.”     Mrs. Clinton also did not address her own deep ties to Wall Street and the corporate sector. A Wall Street Journal analysis last year showed that Mrs. Clinton and her husband raised more than $1 billion from U.S. companies and industry donors over the past 20 years through paid speeches and for political campaigns and nonprofit work.     Prominent financial firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. pumped more than $208 million into Clinton accounts and the Democratic National Committee when Bill Clinton served as president, the Journal analysis showed.     Mrs. Clinton introduced a few self-deprecatory notes in an address to the crowd, which included many young supporters.     Now 67, Mrs. Clinton would be the oldest person other than Ronald Reagan to take the oath of office, if she were to win in 2016.      “I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States!” Mrs. Clinton said—a line that drew the biggest applause of the afternoon.     As she has in previous campaigns, Mrs. Clinton spoke of learning from the childhood struggles of her late mother, Dorothy Rodham. She described her mother as an inspirational force who encouraged her daughter to persevere. Her mother, she said, had been abandoned by her own parents and compelled to find work as a house maid.     “My mother taught me that everyone needs a chance and a champion,” she said. “She knew what it’s like not to have either one.”     One of the standard bearers of the Democrats’ liberal wing sat out the rally. New York City Mayor         Bill de Blasio    managed Mrs. Clinton’s 2000 Senate race and supported her in her 2008 presidential run, but remained notably absent on Saturday.                                                  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at her official campaign launch rally on Saturday in New York City.                  Photo:            John Moore/Getty Images                                                                                                             In recent days, Mr. de Blasio has talked up Mr. Sanders, the liberal senator from Vermont. “I’m waiting to hear, as I’ve said, her larger vision for addressing income inequality,” the mayor said recently. “I’ve always liked what I heard from Bernie Sanders.”     Mrs. Clinton is in a strong position in the Democratic nomination contest. She is running nearly 50 points ahead of her closest rival, Mr. Sanders.     With her rally Saturday, Mrs. Clinton hoped to refocus attention on her message—something she’s struggled to do since she officially entered the race.     Over the past few months, she has had to cope with a string of disclosures about her use of a private email account to conduct official business as secretary of state and about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation while she served in the administration.      Amid the revelations, Mrs. Clinton’s poll numbers have sagged.     A CNN poll released this month showed that 57% of people did not view her as honest and trustworthy, an eight-point jump since March. Half the people surveyed said she did not inspire confidence, while only 47% believed she cares about people like them.     In describing her mother’s struggle, Mrs. Clinton is trying to counter a problem that has dogged her since she first appeared on the national stage 25 years ago. However famous she may be, most people know little about her roots and personal story, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say.     This isn’t the first time Mrs. Clinton has highlighted her mother’s story. In her failed campaign in 2008, she also talked about Dorothy Rodham and occasionally brought her along on the campaign trail.     Some Clinton supporters say Dorothy Rodham’s travails will help to soften Mrs. Clinton’s public image, reminding voters that her family came from modest origins. That point has been obscured by reports that Mrs. Clinton and her husband collected $25 million in speaking fees in the past year and a half, according to a personal financial disclosure form she released last month.
