New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is bulking up his political team with three veterans of George W. Bush's re-election campaign in preparation for a likely presidential bid, and his allies have formally launched a super PAC to amplify the expected campaign.This burst of activity from the Christie camp comes at a perilous juncture for the New Jersey governor. Polls show his support slipping among Republican primary voters, and the onetime front runner has been overshadowed recently by a pair of potential rivals – former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Phil Cox, the former executive director of the Republican Governors Association who worked closely with Mr. Christie during his tenure as chairman, has formed a super PAC, America Leads, to raise large sums from wealthy donors in order to advertise and conduct voter outreach on behalf of the New Jersey governor, in what most expect to be a prolonged and expensive nominating fight.     At the same time, a separate political action committee, Leadership Matters for America, is adding three veteran operatives who played senior roles in George W. Bush’s re-election.          The additions include Brian Jones, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee who advised the last three GOP presidential nominees; Cary Evans, a regional political director on the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign with years of experience in the early voting state of Nevada; and Kevin Shuvalov, another Bush alum with deep ties to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa.     “Chris Christie’s bold leadership is inspiring some of the best operatives in the country to join his team,” said Mike DuHaime, a top strategist for the New Jersey governor. “They bring a wealth of winning experience to Gov. Christie, a man who has already proven he can win in the toughest of places for a Republican.”     With a number of Republicans expected to announce presidential bids in early April, the launch of Mr. Christie’s super PAC and the addition of seasoned advisers both send signals to potential donors and early-state activists that he remains serious about a bid, despite his recent slump in the polls and the whispers from other camps that he might not run.     All three of these new advisers worked closely with Mr. DuHaime on the 2004 Bush campaign when he served as a regional political director for the then-president and helped run their highly regarded get-out-the-vote effort. Mr. Evans also worked with Mr. DuHaime on former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 presidential bid, a campaign Mr. DuHaime ran.     The Christie team launched a leadership PAC back in January to give him a vehicle to raise money for hiring staff and traveling. The super PAC has been in the works for weeks now, but this marks its official launch.     Mr. Cox forged a close partnership with Mr. Christie during the latter's run as RGA chairman. Mr. Cox will be joined by Paige Hahn, a former finance director at the RGA, and Meredith O'Rourke, the finance director for Florida Gov. Rick Scott. During their four-year run at the RGA, Mr. Cox and Ms. Hahn raised more than $250 million and helped elect 31 new GOP governors, the most in nearly two decades.     "I’ve established this super PAC because it’s time for America to lead again, and I believe Gov. Christie is exactly the kind of strong leader we need at this critical point in our nation’s history," Mr. Cox said. "He’s provided effective, conservative leadership in a deep blue state, bringing people together to solve difficult problems and get results. That’s exactly the kind of leadership we need in America today, and we hope he decides to run."     Mr. Christie has been hitting the hustings as well as the donor circuit in recent weeks to start building support for his likely presidential bid. He will gather his top fundraisers for the first time next week in New Jersey, and his top fundraisers have been reassuring other potential backers that the money is flowing in at a steady pace.     Mr. Christie also plans to attend a fundraising luncheon in Houston later this month organized by his finance chairman, Ray Washburne, the Texan who recently stepped down as RNC finance chairman to raise money for Mr. Christie. Separately, Pennsylvania Republicans will host a fundraiser for the PAC in Philadelphia on March 25. The event is co-hosted by Republican Rep. Pat Meehan, a former U.S. attorney when Mr. Christie served in that role in New Jersey, and Bob Asher, an RNC committeeman from Pennsylvania.     Ken Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot Inc. and a major Republican donor, is also supporting Mr. Christie’s presidential efforts by holding a series of dinners for the governor and potential donors. Mr. Langone convened a meet-and-great with Mr. Christie this week in Florida, along with one in New York City in January. The events aren’t fundraisers.     Mr. Christie and his growing team of advisers have their work cut out for them. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found some 57% of Republican primary voters said they could not vote for the New Jersey governor, compared with the 32% who said they could.     Unbowed by this recent slump in the polls, Mr. Christie was in Iowa over the weekend to speak on a panel about agriculture issues. A week earlier he drew mixed reviews for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference.     He is also holding weekly townhall meetings in New Jersey, where he fields an hour of unscripted questions from residents of the state. The meetings are something his advisers say he will do much more of in the early nominating states should he enter the 2016 field.     “Gov. Christie is a proven leader and reformer who also happens to be a remarkably effective communicator,” Mr. Jones said. “He talks to people about issues they care about in a direct way that few politicians can match.”     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
