                                                                                                                                         Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is planning to give a “major speech” on illegal immigration on Wednesday in Arizona, where he’ll get the opportunity to more clearly lay out what his plans will be after a week of mixed messages.                                                                                                                                                      “I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue,” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday.                                                                                                                                                      The campaign had pushed back a planned speech on the subject in Colorado last Thursday as Mr. Trump got more advice on the subject.                                                                                                                                                                    He said last week at a Fox News town hall that there could be a distinction between illegal immigrant criminals and those with longstanding ties to the United States in terms of the deportations that will be prioritized.                                                                                                                              “There certainly can be a softening, because we’re not looking to hurt people … but we’re going to follow the laws of this country,” Mr. Trump said.                                                                                                                                                                 “There’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr. Trump has since said there will be no path to legalization for illegal immigrants who remain in the country.                                                                                                                              “I don’t think it’s a softening,” he told CNN. “I’ve had people say it’s a hardening, actually.”                                                                                                                              Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox News Sunday” that the “softening” is “more approach than policy.”                                                                                                                   “If you enforce the law and you deal with those agencies that already exist to enforce the law, then we’ll see what we’ve got,” Ms. Conway said.                                                                                                                 “The signature piece of his legislation has, and his campaign, has always been build the wall. That has not changed,” she said. “Build the wall. No amnesty. No citizenship. No more sanctuary cities.”
