HAMBURG—Coming face-to-face in a highly anticipated meeting, the American and Russian presidents disagreed Friday over election interference and about the best approach to North Korea, but made tentative progress toward curbing the bloodshed in Syria’s long-running war.President      Donald Trump        and Russia’s      Vladimir Putin        spoke for more than two hours Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leading nations summit in Germany. The meeting went so much longer than planned that first lady Melania Trump looked in at one point to see if she could coax them to wrap up. It didn’t work. They kept talking another hour.     “It was an extraordinarily important meeting—so much for us to talk about,” Secretary of State         Rex Tillerson,    who was in the room, told reporters afterward. “And it was a good start.”                                         President Donald Trump had separate meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Friday at the G-20 Summit in Germany.

Toward that end, Mr. Tillerson provided a round-by-round account of the conversation, answering questions from reporters about a spectrum of international issues.               The first issue raised by Mr. Trump was one that has vexed him most at home: whether Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential race to help him win. Before Friday, it was far from clear Mr. Trump would mention it at all. As recently as the day before, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the election and was prepared to do it again.     “No one really knows for sure,” Mr. Trump said.     In private, however, the president told Mr. Putin that Americans are upset about Russia’s actions and want them to stop, Mr. Tillerson said. The president invoked a bill passed 98-2 by the Senate last month that would slap new sanctions on Russia in reprisal. The measure is now pending in the House.     Mr. Trump’s message: Russia could pay a higher price unless it keeps out of America’s democratic elections, Mr. Tillerson said.     “The president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement,” Mr. Tillerson recounted.     Mr. Putin denied that Russia played a role. With the two men at odds, they agreed they wouldn’t let the issue poison the overall relationship between their countries.                                         WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains how President Donald Trump may be able to win Vladimir Putin's support in dealing with North Korea’s nuclear threat.

He conceded, though, “more work can be done in that regard.”     “The relationship is too important to not find a way to move forward,” the secretary of state added.     In advance of the two leaders’ first-ever sit-down, lawmakers from both parties called on the president to make plain the U.S. won’t tolerate more Russian campaign mischief.     After seeing reports of the meeting, some said they weren’t reassured.     “Whatever the president actually told Putin, it would have had much more force if, just the day before, President Trump had not equivocated about who was behind the unprecedented attack targeting America last fall,” said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The panel is probing the topic of Russian interference in the 2016 election.     Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, said in a         Twitter    message: “Working to compromise the integrity of our elections cannot & should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion.”        
More        Russia’s account of the exchange differed from that of the Americans. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was also in the meeting, told reporters afterward that said Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin’s contention that Russia didn’t interfere in the campaign.     Mr. Tillerson said that, generally, Mr. Trump didn’t want to “relitigate” the past with Mr. Putin and was eager not to let the election issue doom the broader relationship between the two countries.     In a May meeting in the Oval Office with Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Trump failed to bring up the election in a substantive way. At the time, a White House official said “the issue was referenced but there was no substantive discussion.” Mr. Lavrov, speaking at a press conference after the Oval Office meeting, said “neither of us touched on this bacchanalia.”     The two sides made more headway Friday on Syria. As the meeting played out, officials confirmed that the U.S. and Russia had agreed on a cease-fire in southwest Syria. The sides had been meeting quietly over the past months to see if they could ratchet down the fighting in that part of Syria.     Messrs. Putin and Trump spent considerable time talking about the Syrian war and would try to end the fighting in more swaths of the country, Mr. Tillerson said. The U.S. backs rebel groups opposing Syria’s government and Russia backs Syrian leader         Bashar al-Assad    and has Iran and Iranian-backed militias as allies.     He added the Trump administration would like Russia’s help in doing away with North Korea’s nuclear missile program, an escalating threat to the U.S. homeland.     Mr. Tillerson said that while Russia also wants to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons, it doesn’t share the U.S.’s urgency. He said Russia has “some economic activity” with North Korea, adding that “we’re going to continue these discussions and ask them to do more.”     Ahead of Friday’s meeting, the State Department announced that Mr. Tillerson has tapped Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to be a special envoy for Ukraine negotiations.     Mr. Tillerson later told reporters the appointment was at the request of Mr. Putin. Mr. Tillerson has floated the possibility of a solution to the crisis outside of international agreements reached in Minsk in recent years. Mr. Volker is tasked with advancing the objectives of the cease-fire agreement, which has never fully taken hold.     No other meetings between Messrs. Putin and Trump have been planned. But the U.S. came away from this one convinced that the dialogue is in a better place. Just three months ago, Mr. Trump said at a news conference that relations between the two countries “may be at an all-time low.”     “The two leaders I would say connected very quickly,” Mr. Tillerson added. “There was a very clear positive chemistry between the two.”     —Felicia Schwartz, Paul Sonne, and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
