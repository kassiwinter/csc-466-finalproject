           President Donald Trump slammed both the Democratic National Committee and The New York Times in a pair of early morning tweets Sunday.
Trump tweeted that the race for Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman was “rigged.”
“Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!” Trump added. The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged." Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!

The race, which split along establishment-grassroots lines, reflected the divide that still exists in the party between supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
Sanders and his allies backed Ellison, the first-ever Muslim elected to Congress and a star on the left.
“Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!” Trump tweeted on Saturday.
Perez then responded. Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD
