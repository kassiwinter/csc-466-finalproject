         Arkansas lawmakers voted Wednesday to bar most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, overriding a veto by the state's governor to set the most-stringent abortion restrictions in the nation.     The Arkansas House of Representatives voted 56 to 33 to enact the legislation, a day after the Senate voted 20 to 14 in favor of overruling Democratic Gov.         Mike Beebe.    Both chambers are controlled by Republicans, although six Democratic representatives were among the House members who voted to uphold the measure.

Ann Clemmer,    a Republican sponsor of the legislation, ahead of the Wednesday vote.     The move will face stiff legal challenges. Mr. Beebe, who supports abortion rights but has backed some restrictions, said a series of Supreme Court decisions had established that states couldn't ban abortions carried out before a fetus becomes viable, or able to survive outside the womb. He said the proposed bill "would blatantly violate the United States Constitution."               The court rulings have found that physicians should determine viability, which is generally considered to occur after 22 weeks of pregnancy. The Arkansas legislation makes it illegal to perform abortions after a heartbeat can be detected and the pregnancy has lasted for more than 12 weeks, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and medical emergencies.      The ban is set to go into effect 90 days after the Legislature ends its current session, in the summer.      The American Civil Liberties Union, which supports abortion rights, said that its lawyers planned to try to block the law before it could take effect. "We will fight this law in court to ensure that politicians cannot deny women the ability to make their own decisions about their own health," said         Rita Sklar,    executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.      The move from Arkansas comes amid a wave of antiabortion efforts in state legislatures across the country. Many opponents of abortion, however, have been lukewarm in their support for legislation seeking early limits on the procedure, preferring to focus on securing tighter regulation of clinics and chemically induced abortions.      Most states have laws barring abortion in later stages of pregnancy, such as at 24 weeks or after viability. Eight states have laws prohibiting most abortions after 20 weeks, including Arkansas, where legislators just last week voted to overrule Mr. Beebe and pass such a law. Arizona and Georgia also have 20-week bans, but those have been blocked by courts. No other state restricts abortion as early as 12 weeks.      Before the vote, some Arkansas lawmakers said they were supporting the veto override to stand by their convictions. "I encourage you to stick to your vote if you voted for life before," said state Rep.         Bruce Westerman,    the House Republican leader.No member of the Arkansas Legislature spoke against the veto override.
