                        	AP                       President Trump misidentified the nation’s first coronavirus fatality as a “wonderful woman” on Saturday — the victim, in fact, was a man who died in a Seattle-area hospital, officials said.
The patient, who died overnight Friday, was a man with “an underlying health condition,” Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County, told reporters in an afternoon news conference.
Later Saturday, Centers for Disease Control officials took the hit for the mis-gendering, explaining in a statement, “CDC erroneously identified the patient as female in a briefing earlier today with the President and Vice President.”
“Our hearts go out to the family of the patient who died as well as the families of the people who are caught up in this outbreak,” said CDC spokeswoman Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
“The health of the residents, staff and community of this skilled nursing facility are a top priority. We will work with Public Health – Seattle and King County to support the care of the patients, the safety of the health care workers, and the well-being of the people in the surrounding community.”
In addition to the patient who died, Washington state is also dealing a potential coronavirus outbreak centered at nursing home, LifeCare Center, in Kirkland.
At least one patient there, a woman, and a health care worker have also tested positive for the coronavirus; some 50 patients associated with the center are suffering respiratory illnesses and are being tested.
“We’re in the beginning stages of our investigation” into a potential coronavirus outbreak at the nursing home, he said.
