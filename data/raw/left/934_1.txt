"We deplore violence against civilians.""Today, the United States extends its condolences to the families of those who were killed and those who were wounded," Obama continued.Obama announced that the U.S. is cancelling a bi-annual joint military exercise with Egypt that was to take place in September, but he did not announce suspension of any other forms of aid to Egypt.
