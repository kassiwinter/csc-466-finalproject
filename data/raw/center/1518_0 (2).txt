WASHINGTON—The Senate on Tuesday narrowly defeated legislation that would have approved the Keystone XL pipeline, delivering a political setback to Sen.         Mary Landrieu,    (D., La.), who had pushed for the vote as a way to show political clout in her Senate runoff race against Republican challenger Rep.         Bill Cassidy.    The vote was 59-41, with Ms. Landrieu, a three-term senator who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, falling one vote shy of the 60 needed to pass the legislation, despite an impassioned plea to her Democratic colleagues. After the vote, Ms. Landrieu said at a news conference that since she knew of 14 reliable yes votes from Democratic senators, including her own vote, she thought finding one more would be reachable. Ms. Landrieu said her push to get a vote shows her tenacity on energy issues.

Heidi Heitkamp    of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.                Mr. Cassidy, whose identical Keystone bill passed the House on Friday, criticized the Democratic-controlled Senate for not passing its version. “If there was ever legislation that should be enthusiastically approved by President         Obama    and his supporters in the Senate, it should be the Keystone XL pipeline,” Mr. Cassidy said.      In the last couple of days, several senators whose votes were thought to be in play, including Independent Sen.         Angus King    of Maine and Democratic Sen.         Christopher Coons    of Delaware, said they would oppose the bill, one by one dashing Ms. Landrieu’s hopes of getting to 60.        
Previous Coverage        Several other senators whose votes were considered to be in play also ended up voting against the measure.      Republicans, who won a Senate majority on Election Day, are already planning to bring the pipeline up for a vote as one of their first acts when they take control in January. But Majority Leader         Harry Reid    (D., Nev.) agreed to allow a vote on the bill during the lame-duck session to help Ms. Landrieu. Senate Democratic leaders, however, didn’t try to sway members to vote one way or the other.     The vote followed days of lobbying by Ms. Landrieu, who has been trailing in the polls and has cited her committee chair as a reason Louisiana voters should return her to Washington.     The closeness of the vote, the uncertainty of the result, and the political importance of the vote for both Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Cassidy added to the drama of the day, as it was one of the rare times when a vote outcome was unclear in advance.

Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             As Ms. Landrieu stood in the center of the Senate floor alone during the vote, her white jacket standing out against a sea of dark coats, her Democratic colleagues one by one walked past to vote against her bill. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii), another no vote, gave Ms. Landrieu a consoling hug. Her colleagues had spent the day saying how much they care for Ms. Landrieu and how effective she is as a senator. But the friendship wouldn’t stretch that far.      With pressure building, the bill’s supporters were especially focused on retiring Democrats who wouldn’t face any political repercussions for voting yes, particularly from environmental groups that are strongly opposed to the pipeline and say it encourages fossil fuel use and contributes to climate change.     Protesters occupied the lobby in the personal offices of Sen.         Tom Carper    (D., Del.), holding up a sign saying, “Sen. Carper, if you’re not a climate denier, don’t vote like one.” Eventually, the office called police to remove the protesters. Some protesters also disrupted the Senate shortly after the vote.     Ms. Landrieu started the day with all 45 Republicans in favor of the bill, and 13 Democrats whose support was expected. With her own vote, that took her to 59, and she worked urgently to find that last supporter.      Given how close she was, Ms. Landrieu, who is known to be aggressive in pursuit of her priorities, went into high gear on Tuesday, launching what one Democratic aide called a “multi-pronged assault.” She peppered her colleagues with texts and phone calls. At the Senate Democratic luncheon on Tuesday, which was supposed to be devoted in large part to immigration, Ms. Landrieu grabbed the platform, focusing it instead on the looming Keystone vote, one Democratic aide said.     Ms. Landrieu had worked to assemble what is known as a consent agreement, which is the arrangement between the Republican and Democratic parties under which bills can be brought to the Senate floor without the usual procedural hurdles. While Senate Democratic leaders didn’t block Ms. Landrieu, they also didn’t orchestrate the arrangement, in a reversal of the typical pathway through which bills end up on the Senate floor, a Democratic aide said.     Ms. Landrieu’s allies, aware that pressure tactics could backfire with some senators, tried a lower-key approach. Mr. Manchin focused on buttonholing colleagues one by one, trying to frame the issue as a matter of jobs and energy security. He had struck out on Monday night, when he could be seen talking with Sen.         Jay Rockefeller    (D., W.Va.) on the Senate floor.     “I asked, and he said he couldn’t do it,” said Mr. Manchin. “Now, has he changed his mind? I don’t know. He’s not someone you beat on.”                                                                                                                                                      Her allies’ more liberal colleagues weren’t swayed. Sen. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), an opponent of the pipeline, displayed a sign calling the project the “Keystone Export Pipeline,” echoing an argument made in recent days by President Barack Obama and other Democrats who said Keystone was designed to take oil from Canada’s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries where it would be processed for the export market, not for the U.S.      Democrats also said a main reason they opposed the bill was that it usurped         Mr. Obama’s    authority on a project his administration has been reviewing for more than six years.      Among them was Mr. King, who on Tuesday dashed hopes that he might provide an additional vote, saying in a statement that “Congress is not—nor should it be—in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project.”     Proponents of the pipeline said they have waited long enough for the administration’s decision on the project, which has faced delays and has become a political flash point in the nation’s debate over climate change and economic growth. The pipeline owner,         TransCanada Corp.    of Calgary, Alberta, first submitted its application more than six years ago to the U.S. State Department, which has authority over cross-border oil pipelines.     Sen.         John Hoeven    (R., N.D.), who was working with Ms. Landrieu to round up the votes, said backers of the project were also checking to make sure that all 59 of the certain “yes” votes would show up at the vote. Every vote was being counted closely. At one point, some members worried that Sen.         Tom Coburn,    who was still traveling back to Washington, might not make it. Mr. Coburn, however, was there in time for the vote.     A couple of hours before the vote, the question of whether Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) would support the bill became the subject of speculation. Even though he told a local radio station in Illinois early Tuesday he was planning to vote no, he declined to tell reporters in the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon how he was going to vote, fueling speculation he might be willing to switch to help a colleague win re-election and save one more Democratic seat from flipping to GOP hands.     But in the end, Mr. Durbin, 38 other Democrats and 2 independents opposed the bill, leaving Ms. Landrieu without the support necessary to advance it.      During Tuesday’s debate, the politics of the Louisiana Senate race were at times on overt display. “I urge a yes vote on the legislation to send Congressman Cassidy’s Keystone bill to the president and create more American jobs,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), said on the floor.     Sen.         Barbara Boxer    (D., Calif.), one of the Senate’s staunchest opponents of the pipeline, sought clarity on whose bill was being debated. Then she blasted the pipeline, described the bill as a “dangerous piece of legislation” and urged Mr. Obama to veto the bill.     The Obama administration delayed its review of the project in April until a Nebraska lawsuit is resolved, addressing questions about a state law that allowed the pipeline’s route through the state. The ruling, expected in the coming weeks, could delay the $8 billion project’s review even more.     “Sens. Mary Landrieu and John Hoeven are to be commended for leading a bipartisan coalition in support of a legislative solution to the protracted regulatory process Keystone XL has languished in for six years,” TransCanada CEO         Russ Girling    said late Tuesday.      The pipeline would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Alberta’s oil sands, to Gulf Coast refineries. Of the total 1,700 miles, the southern 485 miles already have been built and are transporting oil from Cushing, Okla., to Texas.     —Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.
