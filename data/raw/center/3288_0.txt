WASHINGTON—Republican lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a report saying the panel’s yearlong probe into Russian election interference found no evidence that Moscow colluded with      Donald Trump’s        campaign or that the Kremlin favored Mr. Trump in the 2016 race.The panel found “bad judgment” and some “inappropriate meetings” between members of the Trump campaign and Russians, but no sign that those amounted to collusion, said         Rep. Mike Conaway    (R., Texas), who has been heading the probe since last spring. Mr. Conaway cited a much-scrutinized June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York between a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin and top Trump campaign aides, including one of Mr. Trump’s sons and his son-in-law. “That meeting should never have taken place,” Mr. Conaway said. “But we can’t find anything that leads us to a collusion string.”     In the 150-page draft report, which committee Democrats haven’t seen yet, Republicans wrote that Russia carried out an “active measures” campaign in the 2016 election and was likely to do so again in future elections, but said they saw no sign that Moscow was seeking to help Mr. Trump, Mr. Conaway said.          The panel’s top Democrat, California         Rep. Adam Schiff,    in a statement Monday evening, called Republicans’ announcement a “tragic milestone for this Congress” and “yet another capitulation to the executive branch.”        
Related        “By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly,” Mr. Schiff said. He said Republicans on the committee had conducted a “fundamentally unserious investigative process.”     The draft report—the existence of which took Democrats by surprise on Monday—caps a highly contentious investigation in which Democratic lawmakers on the panel have repeatedly accused the Republican majority of a lack of thoroughness and for bowing to pressure from the White House to end a probe the president has referred to as a “witch hunt.”     Partisan divisions grew so deep that the Republicans planned to build a wall to separate their staff from the Democratic committee aides, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Republican and Democratic lawmakers also clashed over the release of a GOP-authored memo accusing law-enforcement officials of improperly handling surveillance of a onetime Trump campaign adviser. The memo was made public over the objections of federal law-enforcement officials and panel Democrats, who said it was misleading and incomplete. Democrats later released a rebuttal that defended investigators’ handling of the surveillance.     The findings of the Republican report, which will not be released for months, are at odds with parts of a January 2017 report by the U.S. intelligence community, which concluded that Russian President      Vladimir Putin        had ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump’s favor.     “The Intelligence Community stands by its January 2017 assessment, ‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections,’ ” said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence. The office, which coordinates and oversees the various U.S. spy agencies, said it would review the House Intelligence Committee report.     Republicans say their investigation has been appropriately thorough, and that working to quickly release their findings best serves the public interest.     While special counsel Robert Mueller has continued to interview and subpoena new witnesses as recently as last week, Republicans have rebuffed multiple requests by Democrats on the committee to bring in Trump campaign associates and subpoena Trump-related entities.      Republican staffers on the committee reviewed thousands of documents that were the source for the intelligence community’s report, Mr. Conaway and his aides said.     Those staffers agreed with “98%” of the intelligence report’s findings, but found that the “2%” of documents relating to Mr. Putin’s preference for Mr. Trump didn’t meet the panel’s analytical standards, Mr. Conaway said. The panel concluded that Russia’s goal was largely to “sow discord,” and that rather than aiming to help Mr. Trump win the election, Moscow believed Democrat         Hillary Clinton    would be president and wanted to undermine her presidency, he said.     Mr. Schiff said in his statement, “The evidence is clear and overwhelming that the Intelligence Community Assessment was correct.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Mr. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, and Moscow has denied any government effort to influence the U.S. election. On Monday night, he tweeted in capital letters that the panel “FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.”      The draft report includes some recommendations for avoiding foreign interference in future elections, including that the Federal Election Commission require more detailed reporting of expenditures, Mr. Conaway said.     The panel’s Republicans are expected to present the draft report to Democrats on Tuesday. Once they have weighed in, it will be submitted to intelligence agencies for a declassification review before being made public.     Mr. Conaway said he expected Democrats to make “extensive changes” to the report, and that the final report would likely include some bipartisan sections and some areas in which Democrats would issue their own conclusions. Among the issues on which Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to reach a bipartisan conclusion is the question of whether anyone from the Trump campaign worked with Russians to help tip the election in his favor, according to interviews with multiple lawmakers and aides on both sides.     The draft report doesn’t appear to have consensus even among Republicans on the panel.         Rep. Tom Rooney    (R., Fla.), who serves on the committee, said in a CNN interview Monday evening that the investigation had “gone completely off the rails” and “lost all credibility.” Asked whether he believed Mr. Putin had sought to help Mr. Trump—which the draft report disputes—he said, “Absolutely.”                                         When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word "Collusion" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain.

Democrats on the committee were surprised Monday by the news that Republicans were taking steps to end the probe. “We have not been informed that there will not be any more interviews conducted,” a senior Democratic aide on the committee said. “We have also not been informed that the investigation has ended.”      The panel’s Democrats have said that the committee has allowed a number of key witnesses to refuse to answer questions, and that Republicans appear unwilling to use tools available to Congress to force answers.      In late February, Democrats publicly identified six individuals to whom they wanted to issue subpoenas, as well as several topic areas they thought warranted additional inquiry. They were rebuffed by the Republican leaders on the panel.     Asked why Republicans hadn’t pursued the subpoenas Democrats suggested, Mr. Conaway said Monday: “We’re not particularly confident that the subpoena process will get us any more information. We have all the evidence we need now to get to the conclusion we’ve come to.”     Republicans also blocked Democrats’ requests to investigate Mr. Trump’s finances. Mr. Conaway said the panel “couldn’t find any link” between the president’s finances and the Russia probe.     The panel has interviewed more than 50 individuals, the last of whom was         Corey Lewandowski,    a former manager of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, who testified last week. The panel didn’t interview the president, but it did call many of his closest aides and confidants over the course of the investigation, including his son-in-law         Jared Kushner,    his son         Donald Trump Jr.    and his former senior strategist Steve Bannon.      A Senate panel, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is conducting a similar investigation. Both are aimed at establishing public accountability.     Separately, Mr. Mueller is conducting a criminal investigation into Russian interference and any ties to Trump associates in that effort, as well as other matters, and has continued to interview new witnesses in recent weeks. The Mueller probe has resulted in several indictments of former Trump associates. Also, three Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens were indicted last month on charges of engaging in a widespread effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.     The Senate panel has functioned with more bipartisan cooperation and is also in the writing stage of its own reports on Russia. The Senate panel’s first product is expected to be an election-security report for state and local governments, to be released in coming weeks. A bipartisan duo, Republican         James Lankford    of Oklahoma and Democrat Kamala Harris of California, have taken the lead in proposing legislation related to election-security issues being raised by the report.      The Senate panel expects to produce additional reports on social media, potential collusion and other topics related to the investigation.
