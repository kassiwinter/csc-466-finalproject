The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is set to start later this week.
During Ramadan, Muslims around the world fast for a full lunar month.
The fasting begins at the Fajr prayer just before dawn and is broken at sunset.
Last year, the minimum duration of the fast was 11 hours but went up to 20 hours, depending on the location. And this year, similar durations will be seen.
Because the sun rises and sets a little earlier (or a little later) each day, fasting hours in Ramadan also change by a few minutes throughout the month.
By the end of the month, each day will be a little longer than at the beginning in some countries and shorter in others.
Below are estimates of the number of fasting hours in cities around the world.
