That was clear in a Senate questionnaire item asking him to list his most significant opinions as a federal judge. Judge Kavanaugh, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, chose a 2008 dissent in which he suggested the high court erred in its unanimous 1935 decision upholding the constitutionality of independent agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission.      The 1935 decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., let Congress set fixed terms for FTC commissioners during which they could be fired only for cause, such as corruption or incompetence. Judge Kavanaugh in his 18,000-word dissent said that under the constitutional principle of “separation of powers,” independent agencies encroached on the president’s right to dismiss executive-branch employees for any reason.                                                 Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the 1935 Supreme Court, above, erred in its unanimous decision upholding the constitutionality of independent agencies.

Mr. Leo says the case demonstrates Judge Kavanaugh’s “adherence to originalism and textualism”—philosophies holding that judges should stick to the original meaning of constitutional provisions and not go beyond the text of congressional acts.           The approach of Judge Kavanaugh, who declined to comment, reflects the inherent distrust, shared by traditional Republicans and Trump populists, of an expanding federal apparatus dating from the New Deal, President          Franklin Roosevelt’s     response to the Great Depression. Judge Kavanaugh’s 2008 dissent came in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which challenged provisions of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act—they were aimed at preventing Enron-type meltdowns—that fashioned an independent regulatory board whose members could be fired only for cause by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “Such unaccountable power is inconsistent with liberty.” The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which adopted Judge Kavanaugh’s position 5-4, along conservative-liberal lines.                                                 President George W. Bush signs the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would become an issue in a 2008 case in which Judge Kavanaugh was a dissenter.

In Judge Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence, it often appears in ways that expand executive authority, and his opinions tend to limit regulatory power strictly to that specifically authorized by Congress—and to read narrow constitutional limits on lawmakers’ power to fashion such regulation. His approach echoes that of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who popularized legal methods such as originalism and textualism that conservatives embraced as correctives to what they saw as the excesses of Chief Justice          Earl Warren’s     liberal court of the 1950s and 1960s. Younger conservatives such as Judge Kavanaugh go further than Justice Scalia, says University of Maryland law professor Mark Graber, reaching beyond the Warren era and President Johnson’s liberal Great Society movement to challenge legal doctrines undergirding the federal response to the Great Depression and the powerful national government that emerged after World War II. In contrast, “Scalia hated the Great Society, but Scalia didn’t have a whole lot of qualms about the New Deal,” Mr. Graber says. When the Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings Sept. 4 on Judge Kavanaugh, whom Mr. Trump nominated to succeed retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, visceral issues that are usual for Supreme Court confirmations—abortion rights, religious exercise, gun restrictions—are certain to arise. This time, separation of powers, typically of more interest to political scientists and government officials than voters and cable hosts, could play more than a supporting role.                                                 Justice Anthony Kennedy, right, swears in Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge in 2006.

Criminal investigations circling the White House—including the Aug. 21 convictions of Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen—could presage a showdown between branches of government unseen since the Watergate scandal brought down President Nixon. The proceedings also promise a preview of the role Judge Kavanaugh could play within a conservative majority which, while fortified by last year’s arrival of Justice Neil Gorsuch, remains divided over personality, pace and methodology in pushing the law to the right. “I’m going to predict a court whose conservative wing will be aggressive in striking down social and economic legislation,” says Yale University law professor Robert Post, who last year taught a legal-theory seminar with Judge Kavanaugh at the Aspen Institute. Mr. Post expects the new court majority will find greater constitutional limits on federal and state regulation in areas ranging from workplace conditions to consumer labeling, letting the marketplace set more standards.                                         When the Supreme Court’s fall term begins in October, justices will hear cases that could impact the criminal justice system, major tech companies and charities.

The Senate question Judge Kavanaugh answered has been put to other recent nominees who used it to send signals about their jurisprudence. Justice          Sonia Sotomayor,     President          Obama’s     first nominee, listed her 1995 decision ending the baseball strike, backing players in a collective-bargaining dispute with team owners. Justice Gorsuch picked a 2016 opinion siding with an illegal immigrant fighting deportation, which countered liberal criticism that he reflexively ruled against vulnerable people while pleasing conservatives through reasoning that rejected Obama Justice Department arguments that courts should defer to administrative agencies. Washington lawyer          Helgi Walker,     who worked with Judge Kavanaugh as a counsel to President          George W. Bush,     says his longstanding interests in separation of powers “come from his own experience.” Judge Kavanaugh, 53, was born in the U.S. capital, where his father headed a cosmetics-industry association. His mother was a Maryland state prosecutor and judge. He went to Georgetown Prep, a Jesuit boys’ school that the future Justice Gorsuch also attended, earned bachelor’s and law degrees at Yale University, and, as did Justice Gorsuch, clerked for Justice Kennedy during the 1993-94 term.

The future Judge Kavanaugh pursued Mr. Clinton but hesitated over criminal prosecution. In a redacted December 1998 memo, recently released, he recommended no action against Mr. Clinton while in office. Anticipating Mr. Clinton’s acquittal by the Senate, he wrote: “I would refer the Clinton perjury/obstruction case to the Attorney General for her to hold in abeyance until the President leaves office.”The Bush years Two years later, after helping the Bush campaign during the Florida election recount, he joined the White House as an associate counsel and then staff secretary until his 2006 D.C. Circuit appointment. Ms. Walker, the Washington lawyer, says Judge Kavanaugh’s career gives him a rare insight into separation of powers. “I’m not sure how many federal judges have served both in the office of the independent counsel and as a lawyer for the office of the president.” His reservations over placing presidents in legal jeopardy grew. “I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,” he wrote in a 2009 law-review article titled “Separation of Powers During the 44th Presidency and Beyond.” “This is not something I necessarily thought in the 1980s or 1990s,” he wrote. His Bush administration experience led him to lament the toll Mr. Starr’s investigation took. “The nation certainly would have been better off if Mr. Clinton could have focused on          Osama bin Laden     without being distracted,” he wrote. A solution, he suggested, would be legislation deferring civil litigation and criminal investigation of the president while in office. Professors          Neil Kinkopf     of Georgia State University and          Peter Shane     of Ohio State University say that once in the Bush White House, Judge Kavanaugh sat at the center of an administration that made aggressive claims of executive power, some of which later were rejected by courts. The two law professors worked in the Justice Department under Democratic administrations.

Photo:            Joe Marquette/ASSOCIATED PRESS                                                                                                              Mr. Obama, too, asserted some of the executive powers Mr. Bush staked out, as has Mr. Trump. Many Federalist Society members and others in conservative legal circles contend American jurisprudence went astray in the 20th century by neglecting the Constitution's original meaning or relying on legislative history and other authorities beyond the text of congressional acts. Three decades after the New Deal, federal ambition expanded under President Johnson’s Great Society, which sought to confront issues such as poverty, racial discrimination and environmental protection. Federal programs proliferated, including Medicaid, Medicare and two new cabinet departments, Housing and Urban Development and Transportation. Unlike FDR, who fought a conservative Supreme Court during his first two terms, LBJ found an ally in the Warren court, which made short work of legal challenges to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other federal initiatives. That era’s long legal aftermath preoccupied a generation of conservatives, driving their determination to change the law’s trajectory by seating like-minded judges on the federal bench.New Deal legacy Much of the New Deal’s legacy, such as Social Security, “is here to stay,” says Mr. Graber, the law professor. But the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh could see a replay of “the battles courts fought with administrative agencies in the 1910s,” he says, when Progressive initiatives to mandate working conditions faced skepticism from a Supreme Court concerned about threats to the economic liberty of business enterprises. On the D.C. Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh has written that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by a Democratic Congress after the 2008 financial crisis, is unconstitutional because it is headed by a single director who can be removed only for cause, rather than by a multimember commission. Lower courts currently are bound to uphold independent commissions under the 1935 precedent. He has argued that net-neutrality rules adopted by the Obama-era Federal Communications Commission, requiring internet-service providers to treat all the traffic equally, violate the First Amendment rights of carriers such as Comcast Corp. and          Verizon Communications Inc.     to control content they distribute. Judge Kavanaugh’s skepticism about the reach of government power stretches to the world of antitrust law and the scope of the government’s ability to block large corporate mergers. And he has found that corporations can’t be sued by foreign individuals in U.S. courts for alleged violations of international law, a position the Supreme Court adopted in March by a 5-4 vote along conservative-liberal lines. He typically has favored employers over labor, including in several cases where he faulted pro-worker rulings by the National Labor Relations Board. While he has chided government agencies for stretching old statutes to address new problems, sometimes he gives the OK. Last year, he provided the deciding vote in a 2-1 ruling that upheld a Transportation Department regulation banning the use of electronic cigarettes on airplanes. A dissenting judge said that when Congress banned smoking on flights in 1987, it couldn’t have meant to include e-cigarettes because they didn’t yet exist. Judge Kavanaugh’s overarching concern has been the threat regulation can pose to liberty, including that of business. To uphold a regulation, he expects to see an explicit direction from Congress. That has been clearest in cases involving the Environmental Protection Agency, the agency he has written on more than any other. In 2016, he dissented from a decision allowing the EPA to cancel a coal company’s permit to dump soil and rock excavated from a surface-mining operation into adjacent valleys. “EPA ignored the costs to humans,” Judge Kavanaugh protested. “That’s how EPA was able to conclude that the harm to some salamanders, fish, and birds from the mining operation outweighed the loss of jobs for hundreds of coal miners, the financial harm to [company] owners and shareholders, and the many other costs from revoking the permit.” In a renewable-fuel ruling last year, he expressed some sympathy with an EPA attempt to recalibrate congressional requirements driving an overproduction of biofuel. But the EPA must stand down, he wrote: “If the regime is indeed flawed, it is up to Congress and the President to reenter the field and fix it.” Corrections & Amplifications   An analysis of Supreme Court justices’ ideological leanings placed nominee          Brett Kavanaugh     close to the most conservative justice on the 2017 court. An earlier version of a graphic showing this analysis incorrectly placed him close to Justice          Anthony Kennedy,     toward the middle of the range.
