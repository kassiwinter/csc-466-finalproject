Students in the Tuesday march hope to call on other students in the region to get involved in the protests, CBS reported.        The students were escorted by three law enforcement vehicles.        A group of students from South Florida plan to travel north to the state's capital in Tallahassee to call for tighter restrictions on gun laws in the state legislature.        Three major protests have been planned across the country this spring in the wake of the Valentine's Day shooting that claimed 17 lives and wounded 14 others.
