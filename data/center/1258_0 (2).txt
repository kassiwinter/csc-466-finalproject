         The White House is preparing a cabinet reshuffle that would send San Antonio Mayor         Julián Castro    to head the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to people familiar with the matter. HUD Secretary         Shaun Donovan    would lead the White House Office of Management and Budget.     Personnel decisions haven't been made final, but Mr. Castro is being vetted for the HUD post, these people said. Mr. Donovan has been offered the OMB job, which he has accepted, according to two people familiar with the discussions.                Read More

Source: City of San Antonio; U.S. Census Bureau           The White House declined to comment on Saturday. A HUD representative referred inquiries to the White House. Mr. Castro declined to comment, a spokesman said. Mr. Donovan didn't respond to inquiries.      Mr. Castro, 39 years old, is in his third two-year term as mayor of San Antonio and is considered a rising star within the Democratic Party. He delivered the keynote address at the party's 2012 convention in Charlotte, N.C.               For the last 18 months, Mr. Donovan has overseen the federal government's response to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in New York and New Jersey. He has also played key roles overseeing the Obama administration's foreclosure-relief efforts. He has served in the cabinet since 2009 and served as an adviser to President Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign.     Mr. Donovan would replace         Sylvia Mathews Burwell,    who has been Mr. Obama's budget chief since April, 2013. She was nominated last month to run the Department of Health and Human Services following the resignation of         Kathleen Sebelius.         The OMB chief plays a crucial role in both the White House's budget planning but also in the general management of government operations. Ms. Burwell was a central figure in determining how the government would be run during the partial shutdown last October. It is an often low-profile office with one of the most sweeping portfolios in government, and one in which crisis-management skills are often needed.     Mr. Donovan attended a New York fundraiser with Mr. Obama on Wednesday, where the president praised the work that the New York native had done on the Sandy rebuilding effort.      Mr. Donovan, an architect by training, has generally had good relationships with Republicans, which could help in a Senate confirmation process. At HUD, he has been heavily involved at times in structuring tax credits and other budget provisions, skills that carried over from his time as housing commissioner in the administration of New York City Mayor         Michael Bloomberg.         Mr. Castro is best known for having expanded public pre-kindergarten education in San Antonio.     "Mayor Castro has built a strong legacy of accomplishment," said         Henry Cisneros,    a former HUD Secretary and mayor of the city, who also credits Mr. Castro with having helped revitalize downtown San Antonio. "Julián Castro has an opportunity to be on a national ticket soon and this puts him in the national conversation."     Former San Antonio Mayor         Nelson Wolff    said he has recommended to Mr. Castro that he consider a cabinet appointment, if one were ever offered, because of the challenges a Democrat faces in winning a statewide office in GOP-dominated Texas.      "We are so conservative it will be hard for a Democrat to break through," he said.     The San Antonio Express-News first reported that Mr. Castro was being vetted for a cabinet job. The New York Times later reported Mr. Castro would lead HUD.
