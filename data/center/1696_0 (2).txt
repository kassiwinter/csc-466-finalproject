Fifty years after a historic civil-rights confrontation at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., President         Barack Obama    traveled there to commemorate the marchers with a soaring speech that celebrated how far the U.S. has come, but also criticized what he considers modern-day assaults on voting rights. Mr. Obama spoke at the foot of the bridge before some 40,000 people, at an event fraught with symbolism, as the nation’s first African-American president honored those who fought to enfranchise blacks. Among those who joined him on stage were first lady         Michelle Obama,    former President         George W. Bush    and his wife Laura, and U.S. Rep.         John Lewis    of Georgia, who was at the Selma march. About 100 other members of Congress attended as well.     Speaking at times with a preacher-like cadence, the president paid tribute to the marchers who were beaten by state troopers on March 7, 1965, as they sought to cross the bridge toward Montgomery, an event that came to be known as Bloody Sunday. The clash, along with subsequent marches, helped pave the way for passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

He celebrated repeatedly throughout his remarks the power of regular people to change history. “What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people—the unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many—coming together to shape their country’s course?” he said.     Because of people like them, Mr. Obama said, the U.S. had made great strides toward creating a more racially just society, one in which blacks run boardrooms, sit as judges and—in a line that elicited fervent applause—serve in elected office “from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office.” Throughout the speech, he sought to connect the struggles of African-Americans to those of Latinos, Asian-Americans, gays and others.     Yet Mr. Obama also highlighted continuing sources of tension for minority communities. Alluding to a recent Justice Department report that detailed allegedly unconstitutional treatment of blacks by police in Ferguson, Mo.—where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by an officer—he said it “evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the civil-rights movement.” He added, “This nation’s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us.”     Photos: ‘Bloody Sunday’ 50th Anniversary in SelmaPresident Barack Obama, former President George W.

And he lamented that the Voting Rights Act “stands weakened” today, after a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that essentially allowed states and jurisdictions with histories of discrimination to change their election laws without securing federal approval.     “How can that be?” Mr. Obama said. “The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy.” He then urged members of Congress to restore the law in full, in one of the most impassioned portions of his remarks. “That’s how we honor those on this bridge,” he said.     But the president found fault with those who don’t turn out to vote. “What’s our excuse today for not voting?” he said. “How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought?”                  “If Selma taught us anything, it’s that our work is never done.”                — President Barack Obama, in his Selma address             Democratic State Sen. Hank Sanders of Alabama, who represents the Selma area, said voting rights are a key focus of the many events this weekend that are part of the anniversary commemoration. “We want this to be not just a celebration, but we want it also to be a refocus, a rededication,” he said. “Because voting rights are under attack.”     Mr. Obama concluded his speech with a rousing salute to America’s diversity that evoked the unifying rhetoric of his two presidential campaigns. “We are Lewis and Clark and Sacagawea,” he said. “We’re the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores.…We’re the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South.”     “I have to call him Rev. Obama,” said Jerria Martin, 26 years old and a civic leader in Selma, after the speech. “He preached a hopeful message that was definitely geared toward my generation. He reminded me what it meant to be a young American.”     Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
