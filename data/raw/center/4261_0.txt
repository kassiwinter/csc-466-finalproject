With few voters still on the fence, President Barack Obama holds leads over Mitt Romney in new polls of Ohio, Florida and Virginia, three of the states likely to determine who wins the White House in November.Mr. Obama has fought Mr. Romney to a draw on the question of which candidate is best equipped to grapple with the economy, the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Poll surveys suggest. Mr. Romney's campaign is built largely on an argument that he can best reinvigorate the economy.                                                                                                                                                           
WSJ/NBC News/Marist PollMore           Among likely voters, Mr. Obama leads Mr. Romney by seven percentage points in Ohio and by five points in both Florida and Virginia, the polls found. The polls, conducted Sept. 9-11, carry a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for those voters.     Mr. Obama's support as a candidate is at or near 50% in all three states, suggesting that Mr. Romney must peel off voters who now support the president to win.                The pool of undecided voters is 6% of the electorate or smaller in all three states. Mr. Obama won the states in 2008.      The polls found some welcome signs for Mr. Romney: He edged the president among independents in both Ohio and Virginia. In all three states, Mr. Obama's job approval hovered at or below 50%. And the polls found a sharp drop from 2008 in likely first-time voters, a group that went strongly for Mr. Obama in the last election. Mr. Romney is also getting a larger share of the white vote than Sen. John McCain did in 2008.     An adviser to the Romney campaign argued recent polls are a snapshot of voter sentiment taken at a time most beneficial to Mr. Obama.           "A lot of what we're seeing now in some of these polls is a little bit of a sugar high after the Democratic convention," said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, in an interview for "DC Bureau," The Wall Street Journal's online political show. He said that Mr. Obama remains in "very perilous territory," because he is below 50% in the key states.     The pivotal importance of Florida, Ohio and Virginia on the national electoral map is hard to overstate. Both candidates can point to an array of pathways to victory in the Electoral College, but nearly every one of Mr. Romney's scenarios requires him to win at least two of the states polled, if not all three.     Were Mr. Obama to sweep the three states, he would sail to an easy Electoral College win in November, even if he lost every other state that has swung between the two parties over the past decade, among them Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and New Hampshire.     Coming less than three weeks before the first debate and less than two months before the election, the polls illustrate the challenges Mr. Romney faces. Mr. Obama has a double-digit advantage among women and an outsize share of the nonwhite vote that closely resembles his 2008 performance.           
MethodologyThe Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Polls were based on both landline and cellphone interviews of adults 18 years of age and older. The samples included 1,316 registered voters and 979 likely voters in Ohio; 1,352 registered voters and 980 likely voters in Florida; and 1,315 registered voters and 996 likely voters in Virginia. The surveys were conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion from Sept. 9-11. Telephone numbers were chosen to ensure a random selection of both landline and cellphone numbers. Cellphone interviews comprised 31% of registered voters and 29% of likely voters in Ohio; 34% of registered voters and 30% of likely voters in Florida; and 30% of registered voters and 28% of likely voters in Virginia. Results for registered voters in each state are statistically significant within plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. For likely voters, the results are statistically significant within plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Sample tolerances for subgroups within each state are larger.           In all three states, the president garners the support of a third of evangelical voters, compared with just a fifth nationally in 2008.     About half of likely voters think the country is on the wrong track, but that sentiment in all three states has fallen sharply since May, when Marist last polled.     Romney aides have touted signs of higher enthusiasm among Republicans this year, but the surveys found the two candidates essentially tied in all three states in their intensity of support. In all, just 2% of those who have picked a candidate said they might still shift their allegiance.     "These numbers don't look like the numbers you would see in the middle of September," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the surveys. Mr. Miringoff cited the high-intensity support both candidates have, the shrinking pool of undecided voters, and the tiny portion of decided voters who say they may still switch to vote for another candidate. "These are the sort of numbers you see after the debates and just as you go into an election," he said.     For months, as national polls have suggested a neck-and-neck race, Mr. Obama has managed to cling to narrow leads in nearly all of the battleground states. Most troubling to the Romney camp has been Mr. Obama's continuing strength in Ohio.          The two sides have poured around $40 million each into television ads in Ohio through the end of August. The Romney campaign plans to spend another $2 million this week alone.     Mr. Romney is seen favorably by just four in 10 Ohio voters, compared with half of voters who see Mr. Obama favorably. Among Ohio voter groups examined, Mr. Romney's favorable rating tops 50% only among evangelicals.                                                 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in September.          Associated Press                                                                                                             The likely voters who remained undecided in the three polls viewed Mr. Obama more favorably than Mr. Romney. Some 61% of likely voters who are undecided are women. In the electorate at large, women have skewed toward Mr. Obama.     At the same time, these undecided voters say Mr. Romney would do a better job on the economy than would Mr. Obama.                                         The Romney campaign is wheeling out ads with tailored messages: pro-government spending in one state, pro-deficit reduction in another. And after his star turn at the party's convention in Charlotte, Democrats continue to lean heavily on Bill Clinton.                                                                                                     The polls were conducted just before the burst of violence in Egypt and Libya that thrust foreign policy to the center of the campaign. They gave Mr. Obama a pronounced edge on which candidate is seen as best poised to deal with overseas challenges. In Ohio, for instance, likely voters sided with Mr. Obama, 52% to 39%, on who would best handle foreign policy.     Since May, Mr. Romney has made little headway in convincing voters in the three battleground states that he is more trustworthy on the economy. The president holds a four percentage point edge on that front in Ohio, and the two candidates are tied in Virginia. Mr. Romney holds a one-point lead in Florida when voters are asked who would best handle the economy.     More voters approved than disapproved of Mr. Obama's job performance in all three states.     The polls represent the first in a series of battleground-state surveys The Wall Street Journal plans to conduct through the election along with NBC News and Marist.
