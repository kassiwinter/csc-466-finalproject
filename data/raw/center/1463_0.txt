Photo: Courtney Pedroza/Getty ImagesSupporters of President Trump protested outside an Arizona election center late Wednesday, chanting "count the votes!" as elections officials continued to tabulate ballots in a state that Joe Biden is projected to win.Why it matters: The Trump campaign was furious that Fox News and AP called Arizona for Biden on Tuesday night with hundreds of thousands of votes still outstanding, as a victory for the Democrat would significantly narrow Trump's possible path to 270 electoral votes.Driving the news: Sheriff's deputies in tactical gear moved inside the Maricopa County Elections center as the protest crowd continued to grow, per CBS News. The elections department tweeted its staff "will continue our job" despite the intimidation.The protesters — some of them armed — had earlier verbally abused members of the media, who were moved inside the center for safety, per CBS reporter Briana Whitney.A tweet previously embedded here has been deleted or was tweeted from an account that has been suspended or deleted.Go deeper: Election protesters rally across the U.S. Editor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.
