                 | February 20, 2021 05:26 PM                Former President Donald Trump intends to attack President Biden's “disastrous amnesty and border policies” in a keynote address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, his first public speaking engagement since leaving office, a source told the Washington Examiner.      Trump is scheduled to speak on the afternoon of Feb. 28, the final day of the conference, to be held in Orlando, Florida.            "Look for the 45th President to take on President Biden’s disastrous amnesty and border policies," a source familiar with Trump's plans told the Washington Examiner.       The former president will also be "talking about the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement," the source said.       Biden detailed a sweeping immigration reform bill this week that includes an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of people living illegally in the United States.      TRUMP KEEPS TIGHT-LIPPED ON FUTURE PLANS AS HE RETURNS TO MEDIA SPOTLIGHT WITH INTERVIEW BLITZ      The conference is typically held in the Washington, D.C., area, but it was moved to Florida for 2021 to bypass coronavirus restrictions. Trump spoke at the annual event several times during his presidency.      Since leaving the White House, top GOP lawmakers and officials have begun visiting Trump's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, a center of activity for those hoping to win or maintain the former president's favor.      Trump has spent his first weeks out of office at his club, where he has been spotted playing golf and meeting friends.       More recently, Trump has refused meetings with some Republicans and welcomed others, sitting down with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise this week. He reportedly turned away Nikki Haley, a former ally and his ambassador to the United Nations.
