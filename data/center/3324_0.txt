The classified August memo from Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein    was disclosed in a court filing by Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors. It seeks to counter arguments by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers that his indictment should be thrown out. Mr. Manafort has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to indictments filed by Mr. Mueller’s team in federal courts in Alexandria, Va., and Washington. Lawyers for Mr. Manafort, who served for several months in 2016 as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, argued in court filings that the deputy attorney general had authorized Mr. Mueller to only investigate matters strictly arising from the main subject of the investigation: Russian interference in the election and links between the Kremlin and Mr. Trump’s campaign.     They said the indictments lodged against Mr. Manafort were faulty because they dealt with charges unrelated to the Kremlin’s meddling.

The Monday filing is also the first explicit acknowledgment that Mr. Mueller was tasked with examining allegations that Mr. Manafort in particular committed a crime by “colluding with Russian government officials” in that country’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Mr. Manafort hasn’t been accused in court of doing so, but in a filing in a separate case last week, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors said the FBI determined that a longtime associate of Mr. Manafort’s in Ukraine “has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.”           Mr. Manafort was charged in Washington with conspiring against the U.S., conspiring to commit money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and making false statements. A subsequent indictment in federal court in Alexandria, Va., alleges he committed tax and bank fraud. He denies any wrongdoing.      Between the two cases, he is accused of laundering $30 million through offshore accounts and using false statements to obtain $25 million in bank loans. He is set to first stand trial in Alexandria in July. A trial on the charges in Washington is slated for September.     The Russian government has denied it meddled in the 2016 election, and Mr. Trump has called Mr. Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt.”                                         When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word "Collusion" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors wrote in court papers filed late Monday that they were, in fact, authorized by Mr. Rosenstein to investigate and try Mr. Manafort on the Ukrainian-related charges.      Citing Mr. Rosenstein’s initial memo appointing Mr. Mueller in May, they noted they had a broad mandate. They wrote that the memo was worded in a way that clearly was meant to include allegations related to Mr. Manafort’s work for Ukraine.      Mr. Manafort, a longtime political consultant, worked for Ukraine’s former president, Victor Yanukovych, who was described by the special counsel as being “a Russia-backed Ukrainian politician.” Mr. Manafort also had a business relationship with a powerful Russian oligarch, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors wrote.     “An investigation of possible ‘links and/or coordination’ between the Russian government in its political-interference campaign and ‘individuals associated with the campaign of President      Donald Trump        ’ would naturally cover ties that a former Trump campaign manager had to Russian associated political operatives, Russian-backed politicians, and Russian oligarchs,” the prosecutors wrote, citing language in Mr. Rosenstein’s original memo.     In August, Mr. Rosenstein further clarified Mr. Mueller’s mandate in the classified memo that the special counsel attached in redacted form to its filings.                                                  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Paul Manafort’s work for the Ukrainian government, court filings show.

The August memo was designed to “provide a more specific description” of the investigators’ work, the filing said.
