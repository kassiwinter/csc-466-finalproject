The president walked from Marine One into the White House residence, and up to the balcony, where he removed his mask. The president announced his expected departure from the military hospital earlier with a tweet. "Don't be afraid of COVID," he wrote. "Don't let it dominate your life."
Upon his return, the president reiterated his message to Americans to not fear the virus in a video posted online."Don't let it dominate, don't let it take over your lives," the president said of a virus that has already taken the lives of 210,000 people in the U.S., most of whom had nowhere near the level of medical care he did.
But although Sean Conley, the president's personal physician, said the president has "met or exceeded" all standard hospital discharge criteria, he also said Mr. Trump may not be "out of the woods yet."Conley declined yet again to say when the president's last negative COVID-19 test was. He also declined to say what the results were of the president's CT scans, saying he's "not at liberty" to say.   The president is still on multiple treatment courses for COVID-19, after announcing his diagnosis late last week. On Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced that she, too, has tested positive for COVID-19.First lady Melania Trump has been self-isolating at the White House.
