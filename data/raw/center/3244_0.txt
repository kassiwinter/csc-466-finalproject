The FBI on Wednesday issued an extraordinary public statement condemning the Republican push to release a classified memo that alleges surveillance abuses at the Department of Justice.The statement placed the bureau at odds not only with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin NunesDevin Gerald NunesSunday shows preview: US reaffirms support for Ukraine amid threat of Russian invasion Florida Rep.

Before Wednesday, the Justice Department’s efforts to combat those attacks had largely taken place behind closed doors or in measured testimony before congressional committees.But the battle is moving into the public arena now that Republicans have given the White House a memo, drawn from highly classified Justice Department materials, that they say shows shocking misconduct at the FBI.Nunes, who describes the memo as facts based on research into Justice Department misconduct, pushed back hard at the FBI’s statement, calling the bureau’s objections “spurious.”“The FBI is intimately familiar with ‘material omissions’ with respect to their presentations to both Congress and the courts,” he said. “Regardless, it’s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counterintelligence investigation during an American political campaign. Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again.”The furor over the memo comes at a time when the president has grown bitterly frustrated with the federal investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties with Russia. He has repeatedly derided the investigation as a “witch hunt,” tweeted that the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters” and called for the removal of senior FBI officials whom he views as biased against him.The memo, which is not yet public, is believed to contain allegations that investigators inappropriately relied on information drawn from opposition research paid for in part by Hillary’s Clinton presidential campaign to obtain a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.Initially, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd sought to convince Nunes not to release the memo by arguing that it would be “extraordinarily reckless” to publish it without allowing the FBI to conduct a rigorous review to flag potential national security concerns.The committee at first stonewalled the bureau from viewing the document at all, because, as panel member Mike ConawayKenneth (Mike) Michael ConawayEx-Sen.

Bureau officials are privately expressing the same concern, according to reporting from The New York Times.One former FBI official who spoke to The Hill suggested that Wednesday’s statement was a straightforward attempt to counter what the bureau sees as misleading claims in the memo.“For sure the FBI doesn’t want to get into a ‘he said/she said’ with House Intel but somewhere, sometime they’re going to have to get the facts out, which I assume supports their position,” Ron Hosko, a former assistant director, told The Hill in an email.“I suspect that’s more likely the truth about their motivation than any desire to damage [Trump],” he wrote.The decision to release the document now rests with Trump, who has five days to decide whether to allow its publication.Caught on a hot mic on Tuesday night after delivering his first State of the Union address, Trump told Rep.
