                                                                                                                                         Responding to reports that the Justice Department is preparing to charge him with criminal corruption, a defiant Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, said he is “not going anywhere.”                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Menendez maintained that he had “always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.”                                                                                                                                                      CNN first reported Friday that the DOJ is preparing to charge the senator over his relation with Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor, who is one of Mr. Menendez’s main fundraisers and supporters. The FBI has been investigating whether Mr. Menendez helped secure contracts with the government of the Dominican Republic on behalf of Mr. Melgen, and also protected Mr. Melgen during a U.S. investigation over Medicare fraud.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Menendez disputed the charges.                                                                                                                              “I fight for things I believe important…and for the people of our country,” he said. “That’s who I am.”                                                                                                                                                       “As we have said before, we believe all of [the] senator’s actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that,” Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Sen. Menendez, said in a statement. “Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.”
