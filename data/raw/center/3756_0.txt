    October 07, 2018 - 01:22 PM EDT                                  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell on Sunday said he doesn't believe President Trump can be a moral leader, adding that it has become "me the president" for Trump, instead of "we the people.""My favorite three words in our Constitution is the first three words - 'We the People.' 'We the People.' But recently it's become 'me the president,' as opposed to 'We the People.' And you see things that should not be happening," the former U.S. Army general said on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS."Powell pointed to Trump's attacks on the press, which the president has dubbed "the enemy of the people," as well as his tendency to insult his opponents and different groups of people."How can a president of the United States get up and say that the media is the enemy of Americans? Hasn't he read the First Amendment? You're not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says in the First Amendment," Powell said."And I hope the president can come to the realization that he should really stop insulting people. And I used this two years ago when I said I could not vote for him in the 2016 election - and why? He insulted everybody," Powell added, noting Trump's attacks on African-Americans, immigrants, women and his fellow candidates for president. Powell added later in the interview that "the world is watching" and that the world "cannot believe that we are doing things like separating mothers and children who were trying to get across the border," referencing the Trump administration's now-defunct "zero tolerance" immigration policy.The policy, which referred adults who crossed the border for criminal prosecution, resulted in numerous parents being separated from their children.
