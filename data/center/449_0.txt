The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered military troops to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, according to a memo from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin obtained by AP.Why it matters: Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday that "on the active duty force, 68% is fully vaccinated, and we estimate just over 76% have at least one dose."Here are figures Kirby provided, by branch: Army: 40% fully vaccinated with 57% with one dose. Marine Corps: 53% fully vaccinated, 60% with one dose. Navy: 73% fully vaccinated, 79% with at least one dose. Air Force, which includes Space Force: 57% fully vaccinated, 64% with one dose.State of play: Although he didn't set an official deadline for vaccinations in the memo, Austin encouraged service leaders to “impose ambitious timelines for implementation," per AP.Military services will be expected to report regularly on the progress of their vaccination efforts. Service members will be able to receive their vaccines at their bases or commands abroad. The military has reported 34 deaths, according to data from the Department of Defense.What he's saying: “To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force,” Austin wrote, per AP. "After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease ... is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people.”The big picture: The Pentagon said earlier this month that it would plan to mandate COVID-19 vaccines by Sept. 15 or as soon as the FDA granted full approval. Wednesday's memo from Austin comes after the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday.Editors' note: This post has been updated with new numbers provided by the Pentagon.
