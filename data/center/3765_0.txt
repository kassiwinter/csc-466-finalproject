I love everyone, right? But the campaign ‘I’m with her’ just didn’t make me feel, as a guy that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son,” West said. “There was something about putting this hat on that made me feel like Superman.”West wore his red “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) hat to the meeting, which the White House said was arranged in order for West and Trump to discuss manufacturing, criminal justice reform and crime.While in the Oval Office, West delivered a 10-minute monologue on a range of topics, including what he said was misdiagnosed bipolar disorder and why he supports Trump.“[Trump] might not have expected a crazy motherf---er like Kanye running up to support,” West said during the meeting.The rapper has faced backlash from fans for his repeated praise of Trump. He offered that praise most recently after an appearance on "Saturday Night Live" last month, in which the rapper again wore his red MAGA hat.
