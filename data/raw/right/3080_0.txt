Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) answered that yes, she believed the Democratic primary was rigged to favor Hillary Clinton when asked Thursday about former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile’s explosive admission that the Clinton campaign had control of the DNC before Clinton secured the nomination.— The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) November 2, 2017CNN’s Jake Tapper said that Brazile’s recent admission that “the Clinton campaign in her view did rig the presidential nominating process by entering into an agreement to control day-to-day operations at the DNC," including strategy, staffing, and finances “must shock” Warren."This is a real problem,” Warren acknowledged, “but what we've got to do as Democrats now is hold this party accountable. When Tom Perez was first elected chair of the DNC, the very first conversation I had with him is to say 'you have got to put together a Democratic Party in which everybody can have confidence that the party is working for Democrats rather than Democrats are working for the party.' And he's being tested now.""This is a test for Tom Perez," she emphasized. "And either he's going to succeed by bringing Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders's representatives into the process, and they're going to say it's fair, it works, we all believe it, or he's going to fail. And I very much hope he succeeds. I hope for Democrats everywhere. I hope for Bernie and for all of Bernie's supporters that he's going to succeed. "Very quickly senator, do you agree with the notion that it was rigged?" CNN's Jake Tapper asked.“Yes,” she replied.
