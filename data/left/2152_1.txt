President Barack Obama said that Muslims in media should be portrayed in contexts other than national security during a visit to a Baltimore mosque on Wednesday.Noting the accomplishments of Muslim Americans, Obama called for them to be more diversely represented on television."Part of what we have to do is to lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community not when there's a problem, but all the time," Obama said. "Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security. It's not that hard to do.""There was a time when there were no black people on television and you can tell good stories while still representing the realities of our communities."Obama's visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was his first visit to a U.S. mosque as president.Also on HuffPost:Obama On Late-Night TV
