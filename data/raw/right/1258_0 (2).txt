                                                                                                                                         President Obama may be vetting San-Antonio Mayor Julian Castros for a Cabinet position, The San Antonio Express-News reported Saturday.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Castro “has signaled his willingness to begin a swift process of confirmation to the post,” including a vetting by the FBI that has already begun, columnist Brian Chasnoff writes, citing knowledgeable sources.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Castro and his twin brother Juaquin have both been noted as rising Democratic stars.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Castro declined an offer to serve as transportation secretary last year, but privately has said that he would have a harder time turning down an offer for education secretary.                                                                                                                   Mr. Obama chose Mr. Castro to give the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte in 2012 and it is widely speculated that he could be tapped for the Vice Presidential nomination in 2016.
