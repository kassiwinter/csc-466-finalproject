         Michael Cohen,    President Trump’s former personal lawyer, has provided significant assistance on Russia-related matters in special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    investigation, including information about attempts by Russian nationals to reach the Trump campaign, according to a court filing by Mr. Mueller’s office Friday.In a separate filing, Manhattan federal prosecutors said Mr. Cohen “acted in coordination with and at the direction of” Mr. Trump in arranging two illegal hush-money payments to women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump, the most direct implication yet by the government that the president was involved in committing federal crimes. Last month, The Wall Street Journal detailed numerous previously unreported actions by Mr. Trump to intervene directly to suppress the women’s allegations.     Still, prosecutors in Manhattan said that while Mr. Cohen deserves credit for his assistance to investigators, he should receive a “substantial” prison sentence of around four years, citing shortcomings in his discussions with law enforcement and the severity of his crimes.               Mr. Cohen is set to be sentenced on Wednesday by a federal judge in Manhattan. He pleaded guilty in August to eight counts including campaign-finance violations and tax fraud. Last month, he pleaded guilty to an additional charge brought by Mr. Mueller’s office, admitting that he lied to Congress about Mr. Trump’s involvement in efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.                                          While President Trump publicly fought with women leading up the 2016 election, in private he directed schemes to silence their stories of two alleged affairs. Here’s a timeline of Trump’s personal involvement.                                                                                                     Mr. Trump said in a tweet of the filings: “Totally clears the President. Thank you!” It wasn’t clear what he was referring to. White House Press Secretary         Sarah Sanders    dismissed the filings as saying “nothing of value that wasn’t already known” and said: “Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.”      Mr. Cohen’s lawyers asked last week that he receive no prison time, citing his cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s office and Manhattan federal prosecutors. Those offices filed separate and at times conflicting sentencing memorandums on Friday, suggesting divergent views of how forthcoming Mr. Cohen has been with law enforcement.     Prosecutors in Manhattan said Mr. Cohen’s request for no time was based on a “rose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes,” and said he hadn’t provided information about additional criminal conduct in his meetings with them.     In contrast, Mr. Mueller’s office wrote that Mr. Cohen had gone to “significant lengths” to assist its investigation, providing useful information about specific Russia-related matters that were central to Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Mr. Cohen also told prosecutors about his own contacts with “Russian interests” during the campaign, the filing said.     The filings provided striking new details showing that Trump associates and the Russian government were in contact far earlier in the 2016 campaign than previously known.      Those contacts came as Mr. Trump was publicly praising Russian President      Vladimir Putin        on the campaign trail, drawing criticism from Republican and Democratic opponents. Russian hackers infiltrated the accounts of Democratic National Committee staffers by the summer of 2015, investigators have found.         Read the Documents        Mr. Cohen told investigators, unprompted, that he had lied when he said comments he made in a radio interview in September 2015 suggesting Mr. Trump meet with Mr. Putin during the United Nations General Assembly were “spontaneous,” according to the special counsel’s filing. In fact, Mr. Cohen told investigators, he had “conferred” with Mr. Trump about contacting the Russian government “before reaching out to gauge Russia’s interest in such a meeting.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin didn’t end up meeting.     Mr. Cohen told prosecutors that he spoke in November 2015 with an unnamed Russian national close to the Russian government who offered to provide the campaign “synergy” with the Russian government and repeatedly proposed a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, the filing said. The person told Mr. Cohen that a meeting could help “not only in political but in a business dimension as well” and that there was “no bigger warranty in any project than consent of [the President of Russia],” which prosecutors said referred to efforts during the campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.      Mr. Cohen, however, didn’t follow up on the invitation because he said he had his own line of communication to the Russian government through another associate.     Mr. Cohen, who has described himself as Mr. Trump’s fixer, handled Mr. Trump’s sensitive business dealings as a Trump Organization lawyer and later as Mr. Trump’s personal attorney.     The details Mr. Cohen provided about the proposed Trump Tower in Moscow are corroborated by other information obtained by investigators, according to prosecutors.     Mr. Mueller’s office said Mr. Cohen also provided “relevant and useful” information about his contacts with people close to the White House in 2017 and 2018.     Mr. Mueller’s team has interviewed more than 20 White House officials, including the president’s son-in-law,         Jared Kushner    ; his former chief strategist,         Steve Bannon    ; and his former White House counsel,         Don McGahn,    according to people familiar with the matter.     The special counsel is investigating, in addition to whether Trump associates colluded with Russia, whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct justice by firing former FBI Director         James Comey    in May 2017 while the agency’s Russia investigation was under way. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction.     Since August, Mr. Cohen has met with Mr. Mueller’s office for more than 70 hours, the Journal has previously reported, and also provided assistance to the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office. While he has been “forthright and credible,” Manhattan prosecutors said Mr. Cohen has only spoken to them about “the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes to which Mr. Cohen had already pleaded guilty.”     Manhattan prosecutors pushed back against Mr. Cohen’s assertion that he had crossed legal lines out of loyalty to Mr. Trump. They said Mr. Cohen’s crimes were calculated to boost his own power and driven by personal greed.      “The sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen’s brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful,” prosecutors said.
