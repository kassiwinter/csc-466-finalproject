                 	The whaling boat Nisshinmaru leaves a port in Yamaguchi, Japan.       AP                       Japan resumed commercial whaling for the first time in more than three decades — despite low demand and condemnation from conservationists.
The whaling boats set out on a commercial hunting expedition Monday following the country’s controversial decision to exit the International Whaling Commission, an organization dedicated to whale conservation.
Its withdrawal was announced last year, with Japan claiming that whale stocks had recovered enough to hunt the marine mammal again.
“We hope commercial whaling will be on track as soon as possible, contribute to local prosperity and carry on Japan’s rich whale culture to the next generation,” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said.
Japan has banned commercial hunts since 1988 but allowed for research whaling, which some criticize as a cover, since the meat was sold on the market.
Through the research hunts, there have been as many as 1,200 whales caught in a year — though the catch has since been scaled back as consumption declines.
The quota was set at 227 whales through the end of this year, officials said. Ships will hunt for minke and Baird’s beaked whales, neither of which are considered by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be endangered or threatened.
“The future of commercial whaling depends on how popular whale meat can be,” said Hideki Moronuki, a Fisheries Agency official. “Whale meat is a traditional food in Japan and I would like many people to try and develop taste for it, especially younger people.”
