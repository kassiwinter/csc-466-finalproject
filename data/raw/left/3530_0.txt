As a precaution, towns like Carefree, Arizona, have cancelled their fireworks shows. But Carefree's mayor found a way to make sure the show goes on -- by lighting the sky with drones."Well, they described it and they sent us a video and we said, 'Let's do it,'" Mayor Les Peterson said.
Call it fireworks without the fire: dazzling displays made up of hundreds of tiny drones carrying LED lights.        Some communities are replacing fireworks with drones                           CBS News                   Natalie Cheung helped put on Intel's Super Bowl halftime drone show in 2017 with Lady Gaga.

But during wildfire season in the West, they're increasingly being used as an alternative to Fourth of July fireworks, which last year sparked 869 wildfires in California alone, the highest number in five years.   One of the drone shows this year is taking place at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, not far from acres of burning brush.
