She thanked dealers who had already pulled these guns from sale and told others: "Sales should essentially cease"."My expectation is that these weapons will be returned to your suppliers and never enter into the New Zealand market again."People who presently own these style of guns are urged to visit the New Zealand police website for more information."Do not arrive at the police station unannounced with these weapons in your possession," Ardern warned. "I can [assure] people that there will be time for the returns to be made and that they will not be criminalised overnight."Following the deaths of 35 people in the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, Australia banned rapid-fire guns and introduced a gun buyback scheme that saw more than 640,000 firearms surrendered.Ardern said she had sought advice from Australia and was "trying to learn" from the experience there."What we hope with the buyback is that you stop a black market emerging around them by paying a fair and reasonable price that incentivises people to bring them in to the police rather than seeking another way in which to sell," she said.She said getting military-style semiautomatic weapons out of circulation was the "most critical" problem, and that a second tranche of reforms would address licensing, registration and storage.Under New Zealand's current gun laws, owners must have a license, which requires a background check and a safety course, but most individual weapons do not have to be registered.Ardern acknowledged that there are responsible gun owners in New Zealand, particularly in rural areas."I have been steadfast in my belief that the vast majority of these owners will support what we are doing here today because it is about all of us," she said."It is in the national interest and it is about safety."The New Zealand opposition leader, Simon Bridges, released a statement saying he supported the proposals and would "work constructively" with the government to make changes."We agree that the public doesn’t need access to military style semi-automatic weapons. [The National party] supports them being banned along with assault rifles," he said."We also support the Government’s proposals to limit the access to other high powered semi-automatic weapons and ammunition."
