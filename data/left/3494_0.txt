     Paul Ryan says Ron Paul's supporters 'should be very comfortable with us.' | AP Photos Paul Ryan said Monday he expects Ron Paul supporters will come around to the Republican ticket and “should be very comfortable with us.”  Ryan told Fox News that he and Paul “see eye to eye on a lot of issues,” adding that he doesn’t feel there is any tension with Paul — who held his own rally in Tampa on Sunday and did not endorse Romney — or the Texas congressman’s supporters.  “So I think, in the final analysis, Ron is clearly going to — he and his supporters should be very comfortable with us,” Ryan told Fox News in an interview airing Monday evening. “Ron is a friend of mine. I’ve known him a long time in Congress.”  “We see eye to eye on a lot of issues and believe in some … limited government,” Ryan added. “We believe in academic freedom. We believe in the founding principles. We believe that this is a watershed moment for America, whether or not we’re going to reclaim the American idea or we’re going to become, you know, a cradle-to-the-grave welfare state, which is where I think the president is taking us.”  Ryan also told Fox that although he’s only 42, he has “more experience” than President Barack Obama did when he began his term.  “We’ve had plenty of presidents in their 40s and vice presidents in their 40s,” he said, according to Fox News. “I’ve been in Congress 14 years. I have more experience than President Obama did coming into office.”
