SEOUL—North Korea’s latest threat—to detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean—if carried through would mark a new level of defiance in the face of warnings from the U.S. and the international community.Pyongyang has notched milestone after milestone this year in its quest to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the continental U.S., each time causing a furor and inviting toughly worded responses from President         Donald Trump.     In the past month, Pyongyang has launched two missiles over Japan and tested its sixth and most powerful nuclear device, which it described as a hydrogen bomb. That follows the first two successful test-launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.

He said he didn’t know for sure what North Korean leader      Kim Jong Un        was planning.               The latest threat marks an escalation by North Korea in the standoff over its weapons program, according to security scholars and regime watchers, who warned of potentially dire consequences.     Mr. Trump responded Friday to the previous day’s barrage of insults from North Korea, tweeting: “Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn’t mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!”     Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday that the U.S. would weigh its military options if North Korea carries out Mr. Ri’s threat.     “We will continue our efforts in the diplomatic arena, but all of our military options, as the president has said, are on the table,” Mr. Tillerson said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “And once we can assess the nature of this threat, the president will make a decision regarding the appropriate actions. That will be the president’s decision.”     The U.S. would be open to talks if Mr. Kim were to halt his nuclear-weapons program, Mr. Tillerson said.     “Voices from every corner of the world are calling on him to cease his program, come to the table and let’s talk about the future of North Korea and the North Korean people,” Mr. Tillerson said.     Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that plenty of countries want to pursue a path of peace with North Korea, “instead of a kindergarten fight between children and no one can stop them,” referring to the heated insults being exchanged between Messrs. Trump and Kim.     The destructive effects of a North Korean thermonuclear weapons test in the Pacific would depend on the power and altitude of the explosion as well as prevailing winds, distance from populated areas, and the composition of the nuclear materials used to fuel the blast, according the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna, Austria.      “If such a test occurred without warning, planes could fall from the sky as their electronics fail. Even satellites in low-Earth orbit could be affected,” said         Morris Jones,    a space analyst, writing for Australia’s Lowy Institute for International Policy. “The environmental effects on the ocean and its fishing resources would also be serious.”     Generally, exposure to the radioactive fallout outside the immediate blast zone can lead to birth defects and increased risk of cancers. The U.S. set off 105 nuclear explosions in its Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1963. Some atolls are still contaminated with fallout, and residents at the time suffered from increased incidence of birth defects and cancer.     Under some conditions, the explosive surge of gamma rays from a nuclear explosion, called an electromagnetic pulse, can overload electronic devices, such as radios, computers, financial networks or navigation systems. Such destructive effects happen only when a nuclear warhead goes off at an altitude of 24 to 250 miles above the Earth’s surface, according to a federal commission that assessed the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on U.S. infrastructure.     The pulse from a 1962 U.S. weapons test called “Starfish,” which was detonated about 248 miles above Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean, tripped circuit breakers, burned out street lights, triggered burglar alarms and damaged a telecommunications center in Hawaii about 900 miles away.                                         North Korea's top diplomat said the country might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean in response to President Donald Trump's threat to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea.

The threat to detonate a nuclear weapon over the Pacific suggests the North is prepared to cross that threshold, though experts say it isn’t clear if Pyongyang would succeed—or if the U.S. would try to shoot down such a missile.     Indeed, the threat was so extreme that some security experts doubted Pyongyang would go through with it. An atmospheric nuclear detonation would be the first since China’s test of a hydrogen bomb on Oct. 16, 1980. All six of North Korea’s nuclear tests have been underground, the first in 2006 and the most recent on Sept. 3 this year.          “It would be tremendously escalatory to shoot a nuclear-armed missile over Japan and conduct the first aboveground nuclear explosion in decades,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “North Korean sanctions and isolation would be ratcheted up to unprecedented levels.”     The threat didn’t necessarily commit the North to firing a missile. Nuclear and missile experts said it would also be possible for the North to follow through on its promise by loading a nuclear device onto a ship and detonating it in the ocean.     But firing a hydrogen bomb-tipped missile—assuming North Korea has perfected such sophisticated technology—would likely be the most dramatic message the North could send, and one that is likely to cause concern about radiation and of an escalatory U.S. response that could plunge the region into war.     “I’m afraid that, for the first time, the U.S. and North Korea have beliefs about what makes for effective coercion that requires each side to engage in antagonistic friction—to be offensive,” said         Van Jackson,    a defense and strategy specialist at Victoria University in New Zealand who focuses on North Korea. “The U.S. has plenty of moves to respond—they just all invite a conflict, at which point we have to worry most about nuclear use and Chinese intervention.”                                         Around the Korean peninsula, American leaders have been openly discussing what was once unthinkable: A military intervention in North Korea. If this were to happen, here’s how specialists on North Korean security see things playing out.

Russia, together with China, presented a proposal in July that would see the country freeze its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for a freeze on military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. has rejected the proposal, pointing to North Korea’s repeated violations of international law and U.N. resolutions with its nuclear and missile tests.     Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said giving up on a diplomatic solution to the problem could have “catastrophic consequences,” Russian news agencies reported.     Japan’s top government spokesman said Friday it was “completely unacceptable” that North Korea was threatening regional security.          There is a possibility that an atmospheric nuclear test could fail, which Mr. Easley worried “would unnecessarily embarrass the Kim regime when it has other technical means for advancing its weapons”—potentially prompting other shows of strength from Pyongyang.     All of that comes amid signs that the standoff between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim is becoming more personal. The U.S. president has twice referred to Mr. Kim as “Rocket Man” in the past week.     Just hours before Mr. Ri warned of a hydrogen bomb detonation, Mr. Kim issued an unprecedented first-person statement through North Korean state media to call Mr. Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and a “gangster fond of playing with fire.”     —John Corrigan, Alastair Gale, Thomas Grove, Robert Lee Hotz and Andrea Thomas contributed to this article.
