I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.” Pilger added in the email that the new policy is "abrogating the forty-year old Non-Interference Policy for ballot fraud investigation in the period prior to elections becoming certified and uncontested."According to the Times, Pilger, who had served as director of the Justice Department's Election Crimes Branch since 2010, added that he would "move to a non supervisory role working on corruption prosecutions.” The Hill has reached out to the agency for comment. Pilger’s resignation came after Barr wrote in a memo Monday that Justice Department investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.”"Nothing here should be taken as any indication that the Department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election," Barr added. "Such inquiries and reviews may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state."President-elect Joe BidenJoe BidenCory Booker and Rosario Dawson have reportedly split US ups estimate of Russian forces on Ukraine border to 130,000 Harris heads to Munich at pivotal moment MORE on Saturday was projected by every major news outlet as the winner of the presidential election, but President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves.
