                                            © Bonnie Cash     FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers Thursday that racially motivated violent extremism cases account for the bulk of the bureau's work on domestic terrorist threats.Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Wray also said most of the racially motivated cases deal with white supremacists."Within the domestic terrorism bucket, the category as a whole, racially motivated violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket within that larger group. And within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket, people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that," he said.“Lately we've been having about 1,000 domestic terrorism cases each year. It is higher this year," Wray added. "I know we’ve had about 120 arrests for domestic terrorism this year."His remarks came after questioning from Rep.
