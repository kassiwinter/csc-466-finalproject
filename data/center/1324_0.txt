WASHINGTON—Two Obama administration officials raised concerns to the White House in 2015 about Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural-gas company while his father, then Vice President      Joe Biden,        led U.S. policy efforts toward the country, a Senate investigation by Republicans concluded. The GOP-led probe shows that officials working on U.S.-Ukraine relations saw Hunter Biden’s position as creating the perception of a conflict of interest with his father’s work, a concern that had previously been made public during last year’s impeachment proceedings. The findings, outlined in an 87-page report, don’t support a central accusation President Trump and other Republicans have made about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s duties in Ukraine: that he sought the removal of the country’s top prosecutor to protect the gas company, Burisma Holdings, from investigation.     “Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anticorruption reforms in Ukraine,” the report says, calling the arrangement “problematic.”        
Related        Both Bidens have denied wrongdoing.               Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said before the report’s release that Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee who led the probe, was using committee resources to “subsidize a foreign attack against the sovereignty of our elections with taxpayer dollars—an attack founded on a long-disproven, hard-core right-wing conspiracy theory.”      An attorney for Hunter Biden didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.     With the report, Republicans on the Homeland Security and Finance committees sought to return a spotlight to the work the Bidens did in Ukraine, renewing a partisan battle over an issue that was central to Mr. Trump’s impeachment weeks before the presidential election. Mr. Trump’s attempt last year to press the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens led to his impeachment in the Democrat-led House, which ended with acquittal in the GOP-controlled Senate.

In their own report released Wednesday in response to the Republican probe, Democratic Sens.         Gary Peters    and         Ron Wyden,    the top Democrats on the Homeland Security and Finance panels, said there remained no evidence that Joe Biden distorted policy to favor his son. They also charged Republicans with knowingly mirroring Kremlin-backed disinformation about the Bidens, saying the investigation relied on witnesses that have promoted Russian disinformation narratives.      “It is unconscionable that the chairmen are continuing to advance false information intended to undermine our democratic process at the expense of the bipartisan work we should be doing to protect our national security,” Mr. Peters said.     Republicans said they relied largely on U.S. documents and testimony from U.S. officials.     The Republican investigation plumbed Hunter Biden’s financials, including payments he received from foreign entities and transactions that the report said were flagged for potential criminal activity. The committees requested information from the Treasury Department, which collects millions of suspicious activity reports from banks and financial institutions each year, as part of their probe.     Democrats wrote in their report that the information in the financial documents the committees obtained hasn’t been verified.     The Republican report contained few revelations about the Bidens’ work in Ukraine that haven’t previously emerged publicly. Republicans identified as a central finding the efforts of a State Department official, George Kent, to raise concerns in 2015 with unidentified officials at the White House working for Mr. Biden about his son’s position at Burisma. Mr. Kent served as the acting deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.     Mr. Kent previously told congressional investigators in testimony during last year’s impeachment inquiry of his concern about Hunter Biden’s board position and the potential optics of a conflict of interest, which he said at the time he had raised with the Obama White House.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSDo the findings alter your opinion of Joe Biden as a presidential candidate? Join the conversation below.        “The presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine,” Mr. Kent wrote in a September 2016 email to other senior State Department officials.     In testimony to the Senate committees for their investigation, the report says Mr. Kent explained he was concerned Hunter Biden’s position could send the wrong message at a time when U.S. officials were pressing Ukraine to root out corruption. He said he believed that Hunter Biden should have stepped down from his position at Burisma. Hunter Biden took the board position with Burisma in May 2014 and stepped down in April 2019 and was paid roughly $50,000 a month for his work.     Mr. Kent also said that the U.S. government never made a decision about Burisma that was affected by Hunter Biden’s presence on the company’s board.     “So there was no time, as I’ve testified, that the U.S. government, the U.S. Embassy ever made a decision about Zlochevsky or Burisma where we took the presence of a private citizen on the board into account. We made the decision on the merits,” Mr. Kent told Senate investigators.     In addition to Mr. Kent, the Senate committees also found that         Amos Hochstein,    a U.S. special envoy for international energy affairs, raised concerns directly to Joe Biden about his son serving on the Burisma board. Mr. Hochstein testified that he informed the vice president in October 2015 that media outlets tied to Russia were highlighting Hunter’s position to undermine his anticorruption efforts in Ukraine.     Hunter Biden has said that being on Burisma’s board while his father worked on the U.S. relationship with Ukraine showed poor judgment.     Mr. Trump and allies have said that Joe Biden’s call for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016 while vice president was to protect his son as Ukrainian officials probed Burisma, though they never brought charges. During Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, Republicans highlighted a video from 2018 of Joe Biden discussing with a U.S. think tank his earlier threat to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine if the country didn’t fire the prosecutor.     Joe Biden’s actions at the time had the support of the Obama administration, Republicans in Congress and U.S. allies, and were aimed at a prosecutor accused of corruption at a time the Burisma probe was dormant. The report states that witnesses said Joe Biden was executing the U.S. policy consensus by pushing for the removal of the prosecutor,         Viktor Shokin.         Mr. Shokin has denied any misconduct, calling his firing illegal.     The owner of Burisma,         Mykola Zlochevsky,    a minister of natural resources in Ukraine until 2012, was accused by anticorruption activists in Ukraine of improperly granting gas-extraction licenses to firms affiliated with him, and was investigated for alleged abuse of power, illegal enrichment and money laundering. Mr. Zlochevsky was never formally charged with any crimes and has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Kent told Senate investigators that he viewed Mr. Zlochevksy as corrupt.                                         President Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, have set off an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.

Mr. Johnson said last year in a radio interview the “whole world” thought Mr. Shokin wasn’t doing a good job. Witnesses in the Senate probe said the U.S. wanted Mr. Shokin removed in 2016 in part so the country would investigate Mr. Zlochevsky more rigorously, according to the report.     The report includes emails provided by Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian diplomat who has accused the Ukrainian government of actively working against Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. Democrats have questioned the Republican interest in Mr. Telizhenko amid concerns from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia is seeking to spread disinformation about Mr. Biden to harm his presidential candidacy. In May, Mr. Johnson called off a planned vote on a subpoena for Mr. Telizhenko, after a classified FBI briefing.     Republicans said that Obama administration officials had previously been in frequent contact with Mr. Telizhenko when he worked in Washington.     Mr. Telizhenko, who has worked closely with Trump personal attorney Rudi Giuliani in his efforts to gather information in Ukraine, said: “I’m glad that all the facts about Biden that were in the press before and dismissed as conspiracy theories have now been put out by the Senate.”     Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com and Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
