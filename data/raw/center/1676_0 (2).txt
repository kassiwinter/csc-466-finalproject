         Missouri congressman Todd Akin's six-point victory over self-funded businessman John Brunner in yesterday's GOP Senate primary underscores just how important momentum and voter enthusiasm are in elections. Mr. Akin's challenge now will be maintaining both in the face of less friendly fire.                                                      Sen. Claire McCaskill          Associated Press                                                                                                             The congressman's religious fervor helped him rally cultural conservatives and propelled his late-breaking surge. Surveys taken shortly before the election showed him moving to close second behind Mr. Brunner from a distant third. Meanwhile, Democrats helped prop up Mr. Akin's fledgling campaign with ads casting him as the most conservative candidate in the race, endorsed by "the most conservative leaders in our country," Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.     Democrats perceived Mr. Akin as the weakest general election candidate because he has a 12-year congressional track record that's ripe for excavation and wears his Christian faith on his sleeve. That can sometimes be unbecoming, as it was last year when he slipped that "at the heart of liberalism really is a hatred of God." To win in November, Mr. Akin will have to appeal to a broader base including disaffected independents who helped Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill beat the Republican incumbent Jim Talent in 2006.      Key to that will be a frontal assault on Ms. McCaskill's support of ObamaCare. In August 2010 over 70% of Missourians voted to reject the individual mandate. The referendum was symbolic since states can't nullify federal laws, but it highlighted just how unpopular the health law is in the state. Missourians will vote again this November on a ballot proposition barring the governor from unilaterally setting up an exchange. Democratic Governor Jay Nixon has floated the idea despite opposition from the Republican legislature.                Senator McCaskill was also one of the few vulnerable Democratic incumbents to defend the President's mandate that religious employers cover contraception. Mr. Akin is well-suited to mount a campaign for religious liberty—so long as he doesn't get distracted by Ms. McCaskill's phoney charges that Republicans are waging a "war on women."
