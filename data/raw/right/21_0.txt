  President Biden released a sprawling proposal to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure and pump money into manufacturing, transportation, renewable energy and combating climate change — a $2.25 trillion measure that will be funded largely by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. The eight-year initiative, dubbed the American Jobs Plan, comes on the heels of Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The White House said it will pay for the latest package by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% — rolling back part of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts — and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21% from 13%.The Biden administration is also planning a second major package, which could cost upward of $1 trillion, that it will unveil in April. That measure, which will likely be funded by tax increases on wealthy Americans, is expected to focus on domestic issues, such as expanding health care, providing universal kindergarten, extending the child tax credit and offering paid family leave.PROGRESSIVES PRESSURE BIDEN TO PASS $10T GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, CLIMATE JUSTICE BILL Biden is set to formally introduce the American Jobs Plan in Pittsburgh on Wednesday afternoon, his opening salvo in what's expected to become a contentious, monthslong negotiation with Congress.

This would double federal funding for public transport.Another $80 billion would go toward addressing Amtrak's backlog repair and modernizing the Northeast Corridor, the line that connects Washington and New York City, as well as Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.The president would direct $25 billion to airports and $17 billion to inland waterways, ports and ferries.Finally, the plan includes $20 billion for a new program that would connect neighborhoods cut off my historic investments and ensure "new projects increase opportunity, advance racial equity and environmental justice, and promote affordable access."BIDEN'S TAX-HIKE PLAN FACES OPPOSITION FROM MODERATE DEMOCRATSElectric vehiclesThe proposal also includes $174 billion to invest in electric vehicles, money the White House said will "enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support Americans workers to make batteries and EVs."It will also provide sales rebates and tax incentives to encourage Americans to buy electric vehicles, and offers grant and incentive programs to state and local governments to expand the number of electric-vehicle chargers that are available. The plan will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and switch at least 20% of school busses to electric vehicles.
