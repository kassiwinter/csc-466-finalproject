The tea-party movement is trying to regroup after taking some licks in this month's elections. Several groups already are setting their sights on 2014 congressional races, in which they plan to promote their preferred candidates and hope to weed out Republicans they consider insufficiently conservative. Many tea-party activists say they remain dumbfounded by the Nov. 6 defeat of Republican presidential candidate         Mitt Romney    and favored GOP candidates for the Senate, and opinions are swirling over how the movement should push forward. In Virginia, organizations that canvassed aggressively for Mr. Romney are now girding for next year's election for governor. Many are moving to support Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in his GOP primary contest against Lt. Gov.         Bill Bolling.         Conservative groups also are considering potential challenges to GOP Sens.         Lindsey Graham    in South Carolina,         Lamar Alexander    in Tennessee and         Saxby Chambliss    in Georgia, whom some activists view as not conservative enough.               After scoring a wave of successes in the 2010 midterm elections, tea-party groups found the environment much less hospitable this year in states where President         Barack Obama's    campaign made gains with the electorate.      One of the movement's most outspoken advocates, Rep.         Allen West    of Florida, lost his first bid for re-election, while Rep. Michele Bachmann, a founder of the congressional Tea Party Caucus, barely scraped by to keep her Minnesota seat. Still, many House freshmen backed by the tea party in 2010 survived this year, and Republicans retained their House majority.                                                 U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham          Getty Images                                                                                                             "This was a very difficult year, with the strength of the Obama ground game and the fact that Romney just didn't inspire much enthusiasm," said         Jamie Radtke,    an unsuccessful 2012 Senate candidate and founder of the Virginia Federation of Tea Party Patriots, a statewide umbrella group that continues to expand and now has over 60 member organizations. "But in many ways, we are stronger than ever," she said.     The federation, Ms. Radtke said, plans to play a big role in 2013 Virginia races, including those for the governor's and lieutenant governor's offices.     Across the country, tea-party activists are drawing different lessons from the year's setbacks.     One of the movement's big losses was in the Indiana Senate race, where Richard Mourdock, a favorite of tea-party activists, toppled six-term Republican Sen.         Richard Lugar    in the Republican primary, only to lose this month to conservative Democrat Joe Donnelly. Mr. Mourdock's campaign took a hit after he said that "even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something God intended to happen."      Tea-party activist         Greg Fettig,    a founder of Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate and a backer of Mr. Mourdock, said the main lesson from the loss is that activists need to be sure the campaigns they support are well-run.      In South Carolina, tea-party activists are looking to mount a primary challenge against Mr. Graham, whom they oppose in part because he voted to confirm Mr. Obama's Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.     "I think he will face a strong primary challenge," said         Joe Dugan,    South Carolina coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. "The extent of that challenge and the money that can be raised will depend on his actions from this time forward."     Mr. Graham didn't respond to requests for comment.     Another potential target is Tennessee's Mr. Alexander, whom tea-party activists see as too centrist, citing examples such as his vote last July against blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation on utilities.     "He is much too close to the Democrats," said         Katherine Hudgins,    a tea-party activist from Murfreesboro, Tenn. "We believe he's an environmentalist at heart. He's gone to the dark side."     Tea-party leaders are now focused on finding candidates who can win, and in Tennessee the search is still on. At a meeting in Ohio last September sponsored by the conservative organization FreedomWorks, a group of Tennessee tea-party activists approached Indiana's Mr. Fettig for advice on how to topple a veteran senator.     "I told them, two years out is not too early to start," Mr. Fettig said.     Mr. Alexander said in a statement that the state GOP had welcomed a range of figures who had pushed the party to the right, including the tea party. "That means we're a little more rambunctious, but we're all headed in the same direction. Our party's bigger, more successful, more conservative, and I'm working hard to continue to be its nominee," he said.                                                 Tea-party favorite Michele Bachmann, below, nearly lost her seat in Congress.          Associated Press                                                                                                             In their post mortems of the 2012 election, activists put much of the blame for Mr. Romney's defeat squarely on the candidate.     "If we choose someone who runs a content-free campaign and is left of center, at least within the Republican Party, we will get our butts kicked," said         Judson Phillips,    founder of Tea Party Nation.     Support for the tea-party movement has flagged since its 2010 heyday.      In a national exit poll of more than 5,000 voters in the November election, about 21% said they supported the tea-party movement, while 30% said they opposed it. Some 42% said they were neutral.     In September 2010, just ahead of elections that gave the GOP a majority in the House, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey of adults showed some 27% described themselves as supporters of the tea party. At the time, 42% said the movement had been good for the U.S. political system, while 18% said it had been a bad thing and 28% said it hadn't made much difference.               Anastasia Przybylski,    co-founder of Kitchen Table Patriots on the outskirts of Philadelphia, said some tea-party activists are still stunned by the results. "Some of these people are like, 'My God, it's the end of the world.' We just need to calm everybody down," she said.     Her group is hosting a meeting in Doylestown, Pa., on Dec. 20 to try to buck up activists' spirits. Ms. Przybylski said she plans to convey the message that "things swing to the right and swing to the left. You can't lose hope."     Others feel disillusioned with the movement itself.         Allen Olson,    founder of a tea-party group in Columbia, S.C., describes the movement's members as "fractured" and "living in a bubble."     Many are in denial about the demographic realities that powered Mr. Obama's win, Mr. Olson said, and the movement has taken up a set of issues beyond its core mission. "It was supposed to be fiscal responsibility, and that was it,'' Mr. Olson said. "They've branched out to things like immigration reform and voter-ID laws. Those are Republican issues, and I don't think they should be tea-party issues."
