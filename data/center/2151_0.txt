MANCHESTER, N.H.—The Republican presidential race in the Granite State increasingly looks like a referendum on Sen.         Marco Rubio    as much as on the current front-runner      Donald Trump.        While the celebrity businessman still holds a double-digit lead ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary, Mr. Rubio ranked second in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters, released on Friday. It caps a week of the Florida senator rising in the polls following a surprisingly strong third-place finish in Monday’s Iowa caucuses. Well-heeled donors in New York and other wealthy enclaves are showing renewed interest in Mr. Rubio. Some other Republicans are rallying around him, including former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, his onetime rival who endorsed Mr. Rubio late Friday. And in the ultimate sign of his post-Iowa bounce, rivals are attacking him with unusual vigor.                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Rubio has emerged as the clear alternative to Mr. Trump and the Iowa winner, Sen.         Ted Cruz,    for Republicans looking to back someone else. He was the top pick of 17% in the Marist poll, jumping six percentage points from a pre-Iowa survey. Mr. Cruz had 15% and Mr. Trump led with 30%.               Meanwhile, three current and former governors—         Jeb Bush    of Florida,         Chris Christie    of New Jersey and         John Kasich    of Ohio—are fighting to keep their bids alive, according to the new poll.     Mr. Rubio’s crowds have swelled, and in a sign that he can go deeper into the primary season, the Las Vegas newspaper owned by Republican mega-donor         Sheldon Adelson,    chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp., on Friday endorsed Mr. Rubio, a potential boost ahead of the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 23.     “Even though he’s scripted, he’s solid on the issues,” said James Betti, 58 years old, a physician from Rye, N.H., who attended a Trump event Thursday but is leaning toward supporting Mr. Rubio. “He has very well-thought out proposals, and he’s the guy who can unite the party.”          Other Republicans will get a chance to slow Mr. Rubio’s rise Saturday night at the last candidates’ debate, sponsored by ABC News and WMUR, the local affiliate. They have previewed their attacks in the aftermath of Iowa, with their outside allies amplifying those messages on television, online and through the mail. Mr. Christie’s attacks have been particularly fierce, dubbing Mr. Rubio “the boy in the bubble” for his reluctance to stray from his stump speech and questioning his record of achievement in the Senate.     Joe McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader, which has endorsed Mr. Christie, penned a stinging editorial that ran on the front page of Friday’s paper criticizing Mr. Rubio. “Young Rubio must think New Hampshire a bunch of rubes,” he wrote. “He hasn’t spent much time here but is trying to sell himself with TV ads as someone who can go to Washington to clean up the Washington mess. Earth to Rubio: You are a U.S. senator. The Senate meets in Washington. You are hardly an outsider.”     Mr. Cruz also enjoyed a post-Iowa bump in the poll following his win over Mr. Trump. He laughed off the increased attention on Mr. Rubio following the caucuses. “If momentum was measured by the media, Marco Rubio would already be the Republican nominee,” Mr. Cruz told reporters after a campaign stop in Weare, N.H. “In the media’s telling, bronze is the new gold. And Iowa demonstrated the media doesn’t get to the pick the Republican nominee.”     Some of the attacks—that Mr. Rubio is too young, that he supported a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally, and that he has skipped too many Senate votes—have sunk in with some voters here.     “The thing that concerns me is him not being at the votes,” said Charlie List, 58, of Derry, N.H., who attended a Rubio event Friday night but is still on the fence. “Most people, if you don’t show up for work, you don’t get paid.”     People fundraising for Mr. Rubio’s team said fence-sitting Wall Street donors are finally warming to him. Bankers, hedge-fund managers, private-equity executives and other financial-industry professionals are promising to open their wallets, according to interviews with existing donors and some others who are planning to contribute.     Investors would like to see Mr. Rubio prevail because he is a “very business-friendly but competent, likeable candidate,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at HighTower Advisors. “Sen. Rubio does provide a certain youthful energy and competence. And he’s future-oriented.”     The Rubio campaign has organized an event in New York a week after the New Hampshire primary in which campaign manager Terry Sullivan will brief his top benefactors on the progress of the race and what to expect in the contests ahead, according to an invitation for the event. In interviews, many top Rubio financial backers said they expect top donors to Messrs. Bush and Christie to switch to the Florida senator after the Feb. 9 primary, even if both candidates stay in the race.     “We have the most robust and accomplished group of leaders in New York,” said Jack Oliver, national finance co-chairman of the Bush campaign. “They have been committed since day one and remain committed to making sure Jeb Bush is president.”​     Mr. Rubio, 44, has already attracted some younger Wall Street donors who have not previously been all that politically active, including:         Thomas Farley,    president of NYSE Group; hedge-fund manager         Eric Mandelblatt    of Soroban Capital Partners LP; Brian Levine, a managing director at         Goldman Sachs Group Inc.    ; and         Sean Klimczak,    a senior managing director at         Blackstone Group    LP, say people familiar with the matter.     In his closing argument to Iowa Republicans, Mr. Rubio talked up his conservatism, religious faith and ability to unite disparate wings of the GOP. In New Hampshire, he has spoken of uniting the entire country, an appeal that could resonate more in a state where independents accounted for nearly half of the GOP primary electorate in 2012.     “We need to stop pitting Americans against each other,” Mr. Rubio told hundreds of people packed into a second-floor bar in Dover, N.H., citing his work across the aisle in the Florida Legislature. “I am always looking for an opportunity to work together because it makes sense for America. I think the bigger key is you have to be the president of all Americans.”     Some undecided GOP primary voters here said Mr. Rubio’s performance in Iowa, coupled with a perception that he would perform well against a Democrat in the general election, are the biggest factors working in his favor. In addition, they note that he seems more viable than other Republicans seeking the support of the party’s less-conservative voters.     But Mr. Rubio hasn’t sealed the deal with them yet. Mark Swartz, 55, an undecided primary voter from Rye, said he is torn between Messrs. Kasich, Rubio and Trump. “I’m not sure Kasich has the legs to make it to November,” Mr. Swartz said. “That’s why I’m leaning toward Rubio.”     —Reid J. Epstein      contributed to this article.
