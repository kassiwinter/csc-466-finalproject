He previously served as senior adviser to Beau Biden during his time as attorney general and worked as the financial director and later senior adviser to Beau Biden's gubernatorial campaign.The move comes amid speculation that Biden might launch another presidential bid. CNN reported Friday that Biden has yet to rule out a campaign and is likely to wait beyond August to decide.Alcorn didn't respond to a request for comment. His hire was first reported by NBC News.Alcorn first worked for the Bidens during the vice president's 2008 presidential campaign. His addition should help the group that has struggled in fundraising since launching in March. The group has only raised roughly $100,000 to date, despite telling CNN in March that they hoped to raise $5-6 million by the end of the year.
