ANTALYA, Turkey—President         Barack Obama    came into office with a single, driving foreign-policy principle that shaped his approach to international crises: Avoid another protracted war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed at least 129 people, present Mr. Obama with a fundamental test of whether the approach is sustainable. With one year in office remaining, the president faces pressure to escalate what is now seen as a global, rather than regional, fight against Islamic State militants, whom France accused of carrying out the attacks. How Mr. Obama responds, in coordination with America’s European allies and potentially Russia, could define U.S. leadership for years to come.     “The attacks in Paris are a game changer,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman         Bob Corker    (R., Tenn.) said in an interview. “I would imagine that you’re going to see…much more desire to have a stronger and more robust effort against ISIS.”               In many ways, the Paris attacks put Mr. Obama at a crossroads. He believed Americans gave him a mandate not only to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but also to broadly pull back on U.S. military involvement overseas. He outlined his world view in his 2009 inaugural address, saying American power “grows through its prudent use” and “the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.”     Obama critics point to Syria and the spread of the Islamic State, two intertwined problems, as a glaring failure of this approach. They believe the growing instability across the Middle East, which is spilling into Europe, is the result of America’s retreat in the world, and that Mr. Obama overcorrected for what he saw as mistakes by his predecessor.     Mr. Obama has at times been forced to scrap his ideal foreign policy goals, from challenging China’s territorial claims in East Asia to extending America’s military presence in Afghanistan and competing with Russia and Iran across an expanding front in the Middle East.     Yet as the Islamic State changes its strategy, Mr. Obama does not appear inclined to alter his.     “He’s taken his risk aversion to an extreme, and while he was reacting to         George W. Bush’s    risk readiness, under these current circumstances that risk aversion has applied to a terrorism policy that in my judgment is simply no longer viable,” said         Aaron David Miller,    a former Middle East negotiator for the U.S. now at Washington’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.     Even some of Mr. Obama’s advisers privately concede the U.S. strategy isn’t designed to “degrade and ultimately destroy” Islamic State, as the White House says publicly, but rather to contain the group. Mr. Obama called Islamic State “contained” in an interview broadcast earlier on the day of the Paris attacks, bringing sharp criticisms from both sides. Mr. Obama in early 2014 brushed off Islamic State as the “JV squad.”     “This is not just an intelligence failure, it’s a failure also of a coalition campaign, because we have allowed ISIS to have sanctuary in Syria and Iraq with too much time to plan and plot,” Rep.         Adam Schiff    (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC on Sunday.     Mr. Obama’s former Secretary of State         Hillary Clinton,    hinted at her differences with the president over Syria policy during Saturday’s Democratic debate, when she said Islamic State “cannot be contained, it must be defeated."     Mr. Obama’s aides say his strategy is designed to change the nature of U.S. engagement over the long term. At its heart is building up countries in the Middle East to police their own region, with assistance from the U.S.     The idea has been at the core of Mr. Obama’s strategy in Iraq, where the U.S. coordinates with the government to assist local forces on the ground. In Syria, where there is no government the U.S. would work with, the approach is reflected in the minimal U.S. military presence.     “The clear desire is to focus on a place where we have a cooperative government, and using a lighter hand where we lack one,” said         Jon Alterman,    a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.     On Sunday, at an international summit where world leaders called for a forceful response, Mr. Obama vowed to “redouble” the U.S.-led military campaign against Islamic State as well as the diplomatic effort to reach a political resolution to the Syrian civil war.     Early indications are that the Paris attacks won’t be a turning point for Mr. Obama. White House officials said he isn’t seeking a dramatic shift in U.S. strategy.     “The key point there for us is that we don’t believe that U.S. troops are the answer to the problem,” said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national-security adviser. “Frankly, it’s more sustainable and effective to have opposition forces on the ground in Syria and partners in Iraq who are able to take back and hold this territory in their own communities.”     In recent weeks the Islamic State has made clear it is no longer simply seeking a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Instead it is employing tactics similar to those used for decades by al Qaeda, carrying out sophisticated and coordinated attacks in France, Turkey and Lebanon. The group also is widely suspected as responsible for blowing up a Russian passenger jet in Egypt two weeks ago.     White House officials cite U.S. strikes against Islamic State leadership, an intensified air campaign and the deployment of Special Operations Forces in Syria as a preview of the more muscular approach.     Mr. Obama, however, is still opposed to expanding U.S. involvement in ways he sees as potentially entangling the country in another Middle East war, such as a no-fly zone in Syria. Some U.S. allies, such as Turkey, have pressed the U.S. for a no-fly zone in northern Syria.     “The president understood quite clearly when he came into office, and had it confirmed for him as events developed, that military action in the Middle East had limited returns,” said         Daniel Benjamin,    a former coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department who is director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth. “And I don’t think those lessons have changed.”     Write to Carol E.
