Kasowitz is no longer running the legal strategy, one of these people said. It will now be handled by Ty Cobb, the internal White House lawyer, and John Dowd, a combative but respected Washington attorney. Kasowitz wasn't immediately available for comment. The lawyer has come under scrutiny for his profane emails to a stranger, recently exposed by ProPublica, and his conduct outside of work, also exposed by ProPublica.Kasowitz has clashed with other lawyers on the team, one of these people said. He has tried to convince Trump to stop talking about the probe publicly and on Twitter but has often failed.
His spokesman, Mark Corallo, also resigned Thursday.
