During that time, House Democrats passed two gun control bills that could expand background check requirements for all gun transfers and purchases, which have garnered pushback from many Republicans.The measures face a much steeper path in the 50-50 Senate.President BidenJoe BidenUS could spend M monthly on testing unvaccinated federal workers: official GOP senator opposes Biden court pick, likely blocking nominee Overnight Energy & Environment — Biden says Russia attack could spike oil prices MORE last week called on Congress to ban high-capacity magazines and assault weapons as well as expand background checks for firearm sales.“We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again.
