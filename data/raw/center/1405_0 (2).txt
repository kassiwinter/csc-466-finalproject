WASHINGTON—Attorney General         Eric Holder's    announcement Thursday that he will resign signals an end to a turbulent tenure as the nation's top law-enforcement official and a potential reset for an administration looking to push through new laws on civil rights and sentencing reform next year.                                         U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder gave remarks on his departure after receiving a thank you from President Obama during a news conference on Monday, saying "much work is to be done but our list of accomplishments is real."

More on Holder                                                                                                                                      His successor will inherit many of the same thorny issues Mr. Holder has wrestled with: Assertions of broad executive authority to conduct military strikes on terror targets, to use lethal drones against U.S. citizens overseas suspected of terrorism and to gather Americans' communications records.      The administration's ability to push through any of its policy goals could be complicated if Republicans take control of the Senate in November.     Among those mentioned as possible successors is former White House counsel         Kathryn Ruemmler,    according to people familiar with the discussions. She and Mr. Holder had dinner together at a Washington restaurant last month. Another candidate being considered is Solicitor General         Donald Verrilli,    who argued the government's case in the 2012 challenge to the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court. And Manhattan U.S. Attorney         Preet Bharara    has been mentioned.               Ms. Ruemmler, 43 years old, served as the top lawyer in the White House for three years and navigated through the various investigations House Republicans led of the administration, including the handling of the IRS targeting of conservative groups, the response to the attacks on the U.S. consulate at Benghazi, Libya, and the Justice Department's seizure of reporter phone records.     The White House could pick a successor in a matter of days or weeks, said several officials, meaning the nominee could be announced before elections but not face the confirmation process until after.     Mr. Holder, who became a lightning rod for criticism related to his handling of terrorism, civil rights and Wall Street investigations, will stay on the job until a successor is confirmed. That could leave him in limbo for months, given that the Senate won't be in session until after the elections. Some Republicans have said a vote on his replacement shouldn't take place during a lame-duck session.     President         Barack Obama,    in announcing Mr. Holder's resignation, said the attorney general "believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory. It's a living breathing principle.''          In nearly six years on the job, Mr. Holder extracted record-setting penalties from big banks, expanded benefits for same-sex couples and took on racial disparities in criminal sentencing and voting. He has also played a key role in some of the more controversial parts of the administration's counterterrorism policy. His department wrote a legal justification for killing American citizens overseas if it is determined they pose a threat to U.S. lives and can't be apprehended through traditional means.      Under his tenure, the Justice Department has also taken a larger role in overseeing the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, which have been sharply criticized by civil liberties advocates in the wake of revelations from former NSA contractor         Edward Snowden.         His approach resulted in tense relations with congressional Republicans that grew so strained the House voted in 2012 largely along party lines to hold Mr. Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over certain internal documents related to a botched gunrunning probe known as Fast and Furious.      Mr. Holder, the first black attorney general, said in an interview he is pleased with the course he has set on issues such as gay rights and voting rights but said he hoped his departure might provide an opening to advance legislation to bolster civil rights and overhaul sentencing laws.                                                  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, right, embraces President Obama in the White House Thursday.          Reuters                                                                                                             "I think there's a possibility for a reset,'' he said. "We have an opportunity with a new Congress to make some real progress on issues I've talked about, criminal justice reform, a new voting rights act.'' He also said he hoped Congress would consider "reasonable gun legislation'' next year, although the Obama administration has already tried and failed to pass changes in gun laws.     Mr. Holder's successor also will inherit the standoff between the Obama administration and Congress over what to do with the more than 100 prisoners held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.     Mr. Holder's chief nemesis in Congress, Rep.         Darrell Issa    (R., Calif.), on Thursday called him "the most divisive U.S. attorney general in modern history.''     Mr. Issa, who chairs the House committee still locked in a lawsuit with the Justice Department over documents related to the botched Mexican gunrunning probe, also faulted Mr. Holder for subpoenas issued for journalists' phone records as part of leak probes. "By needlessly injecting politics into law enforcement, Attorney General Holder's legacy has eroded more confidence in our legal system than any attorney general before him," he said.     Boston College law professor         George Brown    said Mr. Holder's legacy will be the legal continuation of a "broad, presidential authority to deal with what is essentially a wartime situation…at a time when the president's legal advisers supported and justified his extraordinary assertion of executive power.''     Before he goes, Mr. Holder said, he plans to make public recommendations about the use of the death penalty. The Justice Department is currently reviewing federal and state policies for executing those on death row. Mr. Holder personally opposes the death penalty, though as attorney general he has approved it in individual cases.                                                                                                                                                              Thomas Perrelli,    a former top aide to Mr. Holder, said criminal-justice reform "has not been a focus of a lot of attorneys general, so the question is, will the next attorney general continue that work? They might, or they might not.''     The debates over surveillance and terrorism are likely to keep raging long after Mr. Holder is gone. "That is not going away, and there will always be new [national security] issues for the next attorney general,'' he said.     Mr. Holder has been in the job since the beginning of the Obama administration and is considered one of Mr. Obama's closest friends in the cabinet. He has long signaled he wanted to leave the job by the end of 2014.      An official said the attorney general and the president had several discussions about his departure, which culminated in a Labor Day meeting at the White House. The attorney general has been asking for such a conversation for months, according to people close to him, and had planned to discuss the matter when he and the president were vacationing on Martha's Vineyard in August.      The two did speak, but at the time they were consumed with responding to the crisis in Ferguson, Mo., where protesters clashed with police after an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old.     Mr. Holder's last year on the job has been marked by a push to strike multibillion-dollar settlements with big banks over their conduct leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, in the face of criticism that he failed to charge any senior executives for their roles in the meltdown. His department recently extracted a record $16.65 billion from         Bank of America Corp.    for its sale of flawed mortgages, and last year it reached a $13 billion mortgage settlement with         J.P. Morgan Chase    & Co.     Mr. Holder's time as the nation's top law-enforcement official got off to a rocky start when he called America "a nation of cowards'' for its aversion to talking about racial issues—remarks that caused consternation in the White House.                                                 Attorney General Eric Holder wipes his eye after President Barack Obama announced Mr. Holder would resign.          Associated Press                                                                                                                   
Previously           Within months, he was engaged in a new battle over his plan to try Sept. 11 terror suspects in New York, and close the prison in Guantanamo Bay.     He lost both those fights, but still insists he made the right choices. Time, he has said, is proving the Obama administration's policy goals on prosecuting terrorists are the right ones. If Sept. 11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had gone to trial in New York, Mr. Holder has declared several times this year, he would be sitting on Death Row by now.     "As politics recedes, the substance emerges,'' Mr. Holder said in the earlier interview, pointing to a series of convictions in terror cases in New York. "I think the landscape has changed because I don't think that the political argument stood up against the facts.''     In the past year, Mr. Holder has also sought to set a course for the Justice Department's priorities after he is gone—on issues such as gay rights, voting rights and a reduction of prison sentences for nonviolent offenders.     Increasingly, he has sought to use his prominent position to speak out publicly for policy changes. Last week, he called for bigger whistleblower bonuses for people who provide evidence of wrongdoing on Wall Street. In an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal on the long-term effects of some criminal justice policies, Mr. Holder said: "You use the bully pulpit that I have as attorney general to make people and public officials aware of the nature of this problem and also the consequences that flow from not fixing, not dealing with this problem.''     —Gary Fields contributed to this article.
