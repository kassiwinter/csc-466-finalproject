President Barack Obama celebrated Earth Day in the Florida Everglades Wednesday, as he called on the country to set aside partisanship and act on climate change before it is too late.“This is not a problem for another generation – this is a problem now,” Mr. Obama said in brief remarks that highlighted the risks posed by climate change and decried those who deny the threat. Wednesday’s trip was the president’s first to the Everglades, a region the White House called “ground zero” for the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels in the low-lying area are eroding the shoreline, endangering the landscape and threatening drinking water supplies.     Mr. Obama’s tour of Everglades National Park was part of a broad administration-wide push to show the present-day impacts of climate change and to underscore the president’s commitment to addressing the issue. The president said changes to the climate already have had serious implications for the way people live but that there’s still an opportunity to do something about it.          White House officials said the president wanted to use the trip to put the issue of climate change in a prominent place on the public agenda. But the few hours Mr. Obama spent in Florida served a political purpose as well.     With the 2016 presidential campaign shifting into gear, Mr. Obama ventured to a key swing state. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who announced his bid for president last week, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is expected to seek the GOP nomination, both hail from the Sunshine State.     Mr. Rubio recently questioned humans’ role in climate change and said efforts to reverse such changes would have a devastating impact on the economy.     “I believe climate is changing because there’s never been a moment where the climate is not changing,” Mr. Rubio said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “The question is, what percentage of that or what is due to human activity?”     Mr. Bush recently said on a visit to New Hampshire that he is “concerned” about climate change. He said carbon emissions could be reduced by taking advantage of an abundance of natural gas.     White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama’s objective wasn’t to target a particular candidate’s home state but to elevate the larger political debate about climate change.     That debate escalated as the White House and Florida Gov. Rick Scott sparred from afar, with the governor suggesting that the president hasn’t done enough to protect the state’s natural resources and White House officials jabbing at Mr. Scott’s record on climate change.     Mr. Scott, a Republican, said in a statement that he is focused on “real solutions” to protect the environment and that Mr. Obama had failed to make good on his promises.     “President Obama needs to live up to his commitment on the Everglades and find a way to fund the $58 million in backlog funding Everglades National Park hasn’t received from the federal government,” he said. “This has caused critical maintenance delays in the Everglades to linger for over a year.”     Mr. Scott added that the president’s budget would cut funding for the repair of the Lake Okeechobee Dike.     “Our environment is too important to neglect,” he said.     Mr. Scott has repeatedly answered questions about climate change by saying that he isn’t a scientist. And in recent reports, former Florida officials have said Mr. Scott directed state agencies not to use the phrase “climate change.” The governor has denied such a prohibition exists.     Mr. Earnest said it’s a “little rich” for someone who banned the words “climate change” to suggest the president hasn’t done enough in this realm.     In his remarks, Mr. Obama made a not-so-subtle reference to the issue, saying climate change can no longer be denied.     “It can’t be edited out,” the president said. “It can’t be omitted from the conversation.”     The White House has been taking a more aggressive posture toward those who question the need to act urgently to combat climate change, leveling sharp criticism, and saying the debate about this issue is settled. Mr. Earnest said officials who deny the reality of climate change do so to the detriment of their constituents, adding that it’s a “failure of leadership.”     Polls have shown public skepticism about the need to act now on climate change. Earlier this year, a Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll found that 34% of respondents said addressing climate change should be an absolute priority this year. Some 37% said the issue could be delayed a year, and 27% said addressing climate change shouldn’t be pursued.     In Florida, Mr. Obama said that without action, “there may not be an Everglades as we know it,” adding that climate change should be a bipartisan issue.     Beyond making the case for acting on climate change, White House officials hoped the trip would yield a great photo.     Mr. Earnest said the president’s visit to the Everglades “could result in a pretty iconic image” that would say a lot about the president’s commitment to climate change.
