WASHINGTON—In an acknowledgment of the Republican Party’s new dominance in Congress, President         Barack Obama    and Republican Sen.         Mitch McConnell,    soon to be leader of the Senate, tentatively began charting a path forward Wednesday on trade, taxes and other policy matters.A phone conversation between the two men, who have had a distant and prickly relationship, underscored the new political landscape that Mr. Obama will face in his final two years in office: a Senate that has slipped from his party’s control and a Republican majority in the House on track to be unmatched in at least 68 years. As they debate policy, Republicans also will be able to point to state-level gains Tuesday that included the re-election of tax-cutting GOP governors who pursued conservative agendas.     In separate news conferences, Messrs. Obama and McConnell flagged areas of potential compromise. Mr. Obama invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House Friday to discuss how they can accomplish goals in the lame-duck legislative session beginning this month, such as a new, legal authorization for the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants.               Republicans gained at least seven Senate seats in Tuesday’s balloting and will hold at least 52, with further pickups possible once tallying in Alaska is complete and Louisiana holds a run-off next month. The GOP has gained at least 13 seats in the House and has won at least 243 seats—a majority that is likely to grow as the final races are called.                                                 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell promised bipartisanship, saying at a Wednesday news conference that ‘when the American people choose divided government, I don’t think it means they don’t want us to do anything.’          Getty Images                                                                                                             As Democrats and Republicans began to absorb this dramatic shift in the Washington power alignment, promises to find common ground were mixed with reminders of deep divisions between the two parties.     Both Messrs. Obama and McConnell said they believed the public had sent a message that they should work together.      But asked whether the election was a repudiation of his plans to unilaterally adopt changes to the immigration policy, Mr. Obama said, “I don’t want to try to read the tea leaves on election results. What I am going to try to do as president is to make sure that I’m advancing what I think is best for the country.”     Mr. McConnell, speaking in his home state of Kentucky, said the president’s expected unilateral decision to give protections to illegal immigrants “poisons the well” for agreement in Congress on immigration. “It’s like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say, ‘If you guys don’t do what I want, I’m going to do it on my own.’ ”     Both men also pointed to potential common ground. They said more could be done to expand U.S. exports, a policy area in which both have previously eyed legal changes that would make it easier for the U.S. to strike trade deals. Many congressional Democrats have opposed this legal authority, but Mr. Obama could now work directly with Republicans to complete an agreement.                                                                                                                                                     Both also spoke about opportunities to agree on changes to the tax code, which the two parties have pursued in the past with virtually no success. Mr. Obama is aiming for an overhaul of business taxes he believes could free up new revenue to spend on infrastructure projects. Mr. McConnell was more careful, saying tax-law changes were a potential area of agreement but declining to weigh in on specifics.     In a nod to voter opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama said he is open to making “responsible” changes to his signature legislative achievement. He declined to specify what targeted changes he is willing to accept, saying he preferred to discuss ideas in private with Mr. McConnell and other lawmakers on Friday.     Mr. McConnell, who is under pressure from Senate conservatives to fight for a full repeal of the health law, said he’d prefer that course, but acknowledged that such a move might be impossible while Mr. Obama is in office and able to veto any such effort. Mr. McConnell said lawmakers would move to repeal a tax on medical devices and make other targeted changes to the health law.                                         President Barack Obama said Congress needs to pass a budget, fund the military's efforts to combat ISIS, and fund doctors working to stop the spread of Ebola.

Lloyd Austin,    head of U.S. Central Command, would brief lawmakers during Friday’s White House meeting on military operations in Iraq and Syria. A new authorization of military force is needed to replace the one Congress passed in 2001 after the Sept. 11 terror attack because the U.S. is confronting a different type of enemy, he said.     Mr. Obama congratulated Republicans for a “a good night” in Tuesday’s elections, but also took pains to assert his own political credibility. “I’m the guy who’s elected by everybody, not just from a particular state or a particular district,” he said. He noted twice during his news conference that two-thirds of voters sat out of Tuesday’s election.         More From Capital Journal        Mr. McConnell promised bipartisanship, saying that “when the American people choose divided government, I don’t think it means they don’t want us to do anything.”     But he also suggested that the new Republican Senate majority would take an assertive posture toward the White House. Asked whether the Senate would hold hearings on Internal Revenue Service reviews of conservative groups that the GOP says showed bias, Mr. McConnell said: “Oh, you can bet on that.”     Tuesday’s outcome shocked the White House, which wasn’t expecting such a clear repudiation by voters.         Robert Gibbs,    Mr. Obama’s former press secretary and campaign adviser, described Tuesday’s results as a “wipeout.”      Mr. Obama now enters his final two years in office a weakened president after suffering two of the worst midterm defeats for a White House in modern times. The end of Mr. Obama’s administration will be sharply different from his first two years in office when Democrats had control of the House and Senate.                                         President Barack Obama discusses what he is eager to work on with the new congress elected during the midterm elections.

The new power alignment suggests that Vice President      Joe Biden        will take on a larger role in outreach to Capitol Hill, said         Bill Daley,    Mr. Obama’s chief of staff in the year after the 2010 midterm elections. Mr. Biden had negotiated past deals with Mr. McConnell. “He’s the only guy in the building who knows the Hill in a really serious way,” Mr. Daley said of the vice president.     Democrats and Republicans said Wednesday that voters sent a clear message of discontent with the White House.      “I don’t think there’s any doubt that the vote reflected in large part the president’s standing with the American people currently,” said         Ted Strickland,    a Democrat who served as Ohio’s governor and now is president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.     —Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
