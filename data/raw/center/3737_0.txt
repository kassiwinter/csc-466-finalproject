WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressed Tuesday to hold a vote as soon as possible on Judge         Brett Kavanaugh,    with the FBI expected to wrap up its probe into allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by the Supreme Court nominee as soon as Wednesday.Mr. McConnell was vague on the timing of his next steps. While he made clear the FBI’s findings wouldn’t derail plans for a vote, he retained flexibility to address the concerns of three undecided GOP senators—Jeff Flake of Arizona,         Susan Collins    of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Given the GOP’s thin Senate majority, Mr. McConnell would need support of two of those three lawmakers if all Democrats vote against the judge.     “What I can tell you with certainty—we’ll have an FBI report this week, and we’ll have a vote this week,” Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told reporters.           At a political rally in Mississippi late Tuesday, President Trump mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist who alleged Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a Maryland house party when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh, now 53 years old, has categorically denied the allegation.      It was the first time the president has aimed direct public criticism at Dr. Ford.      “How did you get home?” Mr. Trump asked, mimicking a questioner during last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. “I don’t remember,” Mr. Trump said in mock response of Dr. Ford.     One of Dr. Ford’s lawyers, Michael Bromwich, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s comments were “a vicious, vile and soulless attack.”     The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman sent a letter Tuesday to Dr. Ford’s attorneys asking for evidence buttressing her claim of sexual assault, writing that her allegations have “put Judge Kavanaugh on trial before the nation.”     In his letter, Sen.         Chuck Grassley    (R., Iowa) said that Dr. Ford’s attorneys have withheld evidence that senators need to evaluate the allegations before voting on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.      He requested material covering three separate areas: notes from Dr. Ford’s therapy sessions; recordings of the lie detector test she took; and exchanges she had with the news media.     Dr. Ford’s lawyers didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.     The two-page letter raises a separate issue involving Dr. Ford’s truthfulness. When she testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Dr. Ford was asked if she had ever talked to anyone beside her attorneys on how to take a lie-detector test.                                                 Judge Brett Kavanaugh was questioned about his teenage drinking habits during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.

Asked if she had discussed with anyone tips in taking a polygraph, she said, “No.”     In seeking the lie detector records, Mr. Grassley said that the committee had gotten a sworn statement from an unnamed former boyfriend of Dr. Ford. The statement was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.     The writer, whose name was redacted, said that he dated Dr. Ford from 1992 to 1998, found her to be “truthful” and that he had no ill will toward her.     He said that while they were dating, Dr. Ford lived with a female friend. That person was interviewing for a federal job. The writer said he witnessed Dr. Ford help her friend prepare to take a lie-detector test.     Because of her background in psychology, the writer said, Dr. Ford was able to help her friend understand “what to expect, and how polygraphs worked,” putting her mind at ease about the forthcoming test.     In his letter, Sen. Grassley wrote that Dr. Ford’s testimony at the hearing “raises specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination results. The Senate therefore needs this information.”     On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell sidestepped questions on how long senators would have to review the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s findings and when he would hold a required procedural vote to set up the final confirmation.     It remained unclear whether the public would have access to the FBI findings. Mr. McConnell said only senators would be able to see them, but his No. 2,         Sen. John Cornyn    (R., Texas), said “there does need to be some sort of public statement, if not the reports themselves.”     The Democrats’ Senate leader,         Chuck Schumer    of New York, called for the FBI to brief senators on their findings at least 24 hours before a vote, warning against an approach that is hasty or overly secretive.     “Why are our Republican colleagues so afraid of making this public?” he said. “Almost every step they take, it seems they have something to hide.” Democrats are pushing for the probe’s results to be public, with any personal information hidden.        
More        By Tuesday evening, FBI agents had interviewed three people who Dr. Ford said were at the gathering on the night of her alleged assault. The bureau had also questioned two friends of Judge Kavanaugh referenced in a 1982 calendar, Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett, known as “Squi,” according to their lawyers. Judge Kavanaugh’s calendar indicated that on July 1, 1982, he went to “Timmy’s” house for “skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi,” which he told lawmakers was a reference to brewskis, or beers, at Mr. Gaudette’s home.     The FBI has also spoken to Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate who told the New Yorker that Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were in college. The judge has denied that allegation.     Ms. Ramirez’s attorney said Tuesday that the FBI spoke to his client for more than two hours on Sunday, but that he was concerned that investigators hadn’t yet contacted the more than 20 people Ms. Ramirez had told them could corroborate her account.     “It was a detailed and productive interview, and the agents were clearly motivated to investigate the matter in any way they were permitted,” John Clune posted on Twitter. But he added, “We have great concern that the FBI is not conducting—or not being permitted to conduct—a serious investigation.”     Democrats have made it clear they are likely to raise questions about the scope of the probe if they believe it is incomplete.     Mr. Trump, while praising the nominee, has said the FBI should conduct a comprehensive probe and that its findings could affect his support. “Hopefully, as Mitch said, you’ll have a vote by the end of the week, and it will be a positive vote,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “But it will be dependent on what comes back from the FBI.” He said it wouldn’t be “acceptable” if it emerged that Judge Kavanaugh had lied to Congress.     Newsletter Sign-up Politics Alert Major political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.      The president had been advised not the criticize Dr. Ford and had displayed restraint after her testimony last week before the Judiciary Committee.      But on Tuesday night at the rally in Mississippi, Mr. Trump criticized gaps in Dr. Ford’s retelling of the alleged sexual assault at a house party in a Maryland suburb of Washington in the early 1980s.     “How’d you get there? I don’t remember.…Where is the place?…I don’t remember…How many years ago was it? I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said, mocking Dr. Ford’s testimony as the crowd cheered.      “Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know. But I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember.”     Dr. Ford couldn’t recall certain details, but she testified that she was “100 percent” certain that Judge Kavanaugh was her attacker, which he vehemently denies.      Mr. Bromwich, Dr. Ford’s attorney, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump’s remarks: “Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well? She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice.”                                         An FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh may decide the fate of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.
