Thomas Dunworth / EyeEm | Getty ImagesBay Area tech workers plan to flee San Francisco for the more affordable locale of ... New York City.That's what Wealthfront, an investment management firm that provides robo-advisor services, found when it surveyed nearly 2,700 of its clients who work in the Bay Area at tech companies.The survey is based on a data analysis of clients through the first five months of 2019.Fewer than a quarter of Wealthfront's tech clients in the Bay Area plan to purchase a home in San Francisco proper.Those who choose to remain in California's Silicon Valley think they'll snap up a home in the neighboring cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View and San Jose.But nearly a quarter of clients think they'll part ways with the Bay Area altogether, opting for other comparatively cheaper cities such as Chicago and Austin, Texas."What's interesting is the drastic delta between what people would pay for a two-bedroom home in San Francisco, versus what they would pay in other cities like Austin," said Kate Wauck, vice president of communications at Wealthfront."People weren't moving to other cities to buy these massive homes for the same price as in San Francisco," she said. "Rather they're choosing more modestly-priced homes."Indeed, the median home goal price in the Bay Area is more than $1 million for a two-bedroom dwelling, Wealthfront found.In comparison, investors planning to relocate to Austin and Chicago have a median home goal price of less than $400,000 for a three-bedroom house.Here are the top five cities where Wealthfront's tech investors would choose in lieu of staying in San Francisco.New York CityNew York, New YorkGCShutter | Getty ImagesThe median list price for a home in the New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area is $525,000, according to Zillow.
