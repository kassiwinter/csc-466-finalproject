They may fully pull that hypocrisy muscle.— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) June 27, 2018Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP scrambles to figure out what Trump legal drama means for future  Senate leaders send Putin symbolic warning shot amid invasion fears GOP boycotts Biden Fed nominees' vote as bank fights inflation MORE (R-Ky.) led the effort to block the nomination of Obama’s final Supreme Court pick Merrick GarlandMerrick GarlandSenate Republicans urge DOJ to reject request for 'no fly' list for unruly passengers Prosecutors: Man tried to open emergency exit's door in attempt to spread vaccine views Press: Time for Merrick Garland to flush Donald Trump MORE in 2016, arguing that the seat opened up too late in Obama’s term and saying the “American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.”Todd said that McConnell will have “to make the case that midterms matter less than presidentials” to confirm Trump’s nominee ahead of the midterm elections, adding that it “truly is an insult to voters.”This will be a tough tweet and idea for McConnell to defend. He has to make the case that midterms matter less than presidentials for this tweet to be taken seriously. https://t.co/6O0A48FJx8— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) June 27, 2018 I get the technical difference but it truly is an insult to voters, their opinion only matters in Prez election years, not midterms. Got it. https://t.co/6XCo0Z3jN1— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) June 27, 2018 Trump said Wednesday that he will pick a nominee from a previously released list of candidates, and McConnell said the Senate will vote on Trump’s pick this fall.Several Senate Democrats quickly pushed back against McConnell's announcement, calling it hypocritical and arguing that the chamber should wait until after the 2018 midterm elections to vote on any Supreme Court nominee.Democrats cannot block Trump's forthcoming pick without help from Republicans, who hold a slim 51-seat majority in the Senate. Republicans went "nuclear" and got rid of a 60-vote procedural hurdle when they confirmed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch.
