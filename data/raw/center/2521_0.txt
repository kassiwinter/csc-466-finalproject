CLEVELAND—Over the past week, voters attending rallies in battleground states have seen the marquee players in Democratic politics campaigning for         Hillary Clinton    : President         Barack Obama,    first lady         Michelle Obama,    former President         Bill Clinton    and Vice President      Joe Biden,        among them.Who they haven’t seen is Mrs. Clinton. But that’s about to change. The Democratic nominee, after days holed up in hotel rooms preparing for this past week’s final presidential debate, returned to the trail Friday with a rally in Cleveland. A campaign blitz in the next few days will take her to Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Hampshire, where she will make a joint appearance with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.        
More on Election 2016        By her own admission, Mrs. Clinton hasn’t kept up an especially brisk campaign pace heading into the final sprint to Election Day. Her last campaign rallies were on Oct. 12 in Colorado and Nevada. After returning to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., early Thursday morning following the debate in Las Vegas, she took part in the Alfred E. Smith gala in New York that evening, where she and Republican rival      Donald Trump        swapped jabs before a well-heeled crowd of about 1,500.               At the lectern, she quipped: “This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.”     Prepping for the debates, her aides said, was time well spent even if it meant a hiatus from the campaign trail. Since the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, Mrs. Clinton has expanded her lead over         Mr. Trump    from about 2 percentage points to more than 6 points, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polls. It’s a leap her staff attributes in part to her preparation and debate performances.     “It’s also great to be able to campaign, but to prepare this way and be ready to take full advantage of that [debate] stage and make her case to voters is worthwhile,” Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters aboard Mrs. Clinton’s flight to Nevada for the debate.     The final face-off drew 71.6 million television viewers, according to Nielsen.     Mr. Trump has prioritized campaign rallies over debate prep, as his schedule shows. He campaigned in New Hampshire, Colorado and Maine, among other places, over the past week.In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, he cited the large crowds at his rallies and the extensive news coverage of the events as justifications for his approach.     “We’re doing sometimes five stops a day. We have a very rigorous campaign and we’re doing a lot of campaigning,” he said.     At times Mr. Trump has questioned his rival’s stamina and whether she is up to the demands of the presidency. Asked about that contention, he said: “I hope that she is perfectly healthy. I can’t speak to her health. I can only speak to the fact that few people have ever seen a campaign that is like mine.”     The race has grown increasingly bitter, as evidenced by the barbed speeches at the Smith dinner, an event normally leavened by self-deprecating humor. Still, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton shook hands at the end, a gesture the two avoided during the last debate.     “It was very nice,” Mr. Trump said. “She was very nice.”     As the race has wound down, Mrs. Clinton has tested the proposition that blanketing the campaign trail is a candidate’s best strategy. She has the benefit of a large roster of popular Democratic allies happy to campaign on her behalf.     Still, some party activists privately say having the nominee headline an event helps energize grass-roots supporters, who can then be deployed to voter-turnout programs.     Fewer prominent Republicans have been willing to campaign for Mr. Trump. Former GOP presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush didn’t attend the Republican nominating convention in July, while 2012 Republican nominee         Mitt Romney    has emerged as a vocal critic of Mr. Trump. His top surrogates have been GOP vice-presidential nominee      Mike Pence        and his daughter Ivanka Trump.      On the Democratic side, Mrs. Obama has given some of the most memorable speeches of the race, talking bluntly about her revulsion at statements made by Mr. Trump.     With polls suggesting Mrs. Clinton has consolidated her lead, Democratic activists say there has been scant compelling need for her to devote her time to rallies.     Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist, said the continuous TV coverage of Mr. Trump is now working to Mrs. Clinton’s advantage.     “The very same focus that made Donald Trump is now unmaking him,” he said.     He suggested she campaign less and not take any risks at this stage in the race. “The more she campaigns, she takes the focus off of him,” he said.     —Carol E.
