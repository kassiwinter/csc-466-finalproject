With issues including health care and immigration top of mind, voters thronged the polls Tuesday to determine the balance of power in Washington and across the country in a midterm election that has been set up by both parties as a referendum on President Trump’s first two years in office.People braved long lines and bad weather to cast their ballots, with election-machine breakdowns and strong voter turnout adding to delays in some areas. Historical trends and recent polls suggest the Republicans could lose the House, creating an obstacle to Mr. Trump’s agenda two years into his administration. Democrats need to flip 23 seats to gain control. In the Senate, the GOP is expected to retain or even increase their slender 51-49 majority, according to recent polls.

The No. 1 important issue among all voters in the midterm elections was health care, according to data released Tuesday evening from AP VoteCast, a pre-election and Election Day survey of about 90,000 people who said they voted in the midterms or intended to do so.           Among participants, 26% said health care was the No. 1 issue. Immigration, an issue President Trump has pushed in the last leg of the midterm elections, came in at No. 2, with 23%. The economy and jobs rounded out the early results at the No. 3 spot.     In many areas, voters had to wait more than an hour to cast their ballots. In Apex, N.C., a suburb southwest of Raleigh, voters said the numbers were unusually high, even though there was no high-level race such as governor or U.S. Senate to drive turnout.     Katy Haile, a 39 year-old Web developer, said the line had never been out the door before. On Tuesday, dozens of people spilled out onto the sidewalk.

Local media reports said hundreds of people were waiting in line at some sites. Mr. Sorenson said emergency paper ballots were available if voters wanted to use them. Some voters opted to wait, and others left and said they would come back later, he said.     Democratic lawyers in Washington were closely monitoring Georgia’s election-system problems. The state is drawing particular attention given the backdrop of a high-profile race for governor in which voting issues have been an issue and the Republican Secretary of State         Brian Kemp    is on the ballot.     Mr. Kemp on Sunday asked for an investigation into possible tampering with the state’s election system. Democrats dismissed it as a stunt and distraction from security flaws. Mr. Kemp’s opponent,         Stacey Abrams,    who is seeking to become the first female African-American governor in the U.S., has leveled charges of voter suppression.     The Republican National Committee didn’t report election issues Tuesday afternoon.     In New York City, broken scanners added to delays in some places. At one Brooklyn site, all four scanners went down for two hours on Tuesday morning.      Susannah Meadows, 45 years old, said she waited an hour and 45 minutes to vote. Her husband waited in line and left before voting. “You can’t wait two hours to vote,” she said.     Meanwhile, a large swath of the South and East had to contended with bad weather. Steady rain fell Tuesday across Virginia and Pennsylvania, home to several key congressional battles, as well as New York, and was expected to intensify, possibly affecting turnout.     Many voters said Tuesday that their views of Mr. Trump drove their decisions at the polls. In Missouri’s St. Charles County, outside St. Louis, retiree Bill Craig and his wife, Marilyn, said they cast ballots specifically to add to the momentum behind Mr. Trump and the Republican party.                                         As the 2018 midterms heat up, both Democratic and Republican candidates are positioning themselves as outsiders who will change the status quo. But what does it mean to be a political outsider?

In New Hampshire, independent voters John and Natalie Labby said they had voted straight-Democratic tickets—highly unusual for them, they said—because of their anger with the president.     “It’s just civility for me,” said Mr. Labby, 73, a retired general contractor and Army veteran. Ms. Labby, who is 72 and retired from a vocational tech school, cited health care and immigration policies.     Her voting Tuesday, she said, was “total Democrat, total anti-Trump.”     President Trump has been his party’s highest-profile campaigner even though he is not on the ballot, hosting a string of boisterous rallies.     At the White House on Tuesday, aides nervously awaited the election results while President Trump kept out of public view. One aide said that Mr. Trump was in a good mood and energized, convinced that he “didn’t leave anything on the field.”     Florida once again stands as a bellwether, as voters choose a new governor and cast ballots in key Senate and House races. Mr. Trump has made several trips to the Sunshine State hoping to bolster Republicans and taking particular aim at gubernatorial candidate         Andrew Gillum,    the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, who got a visit from former President         Obama    last week.     From the moment polls opened at 7 a.m., a steady stream of voters arrived at the Aquilina C. Howell Center in Tallahassee. They were a diverse demographic mix—black and white, young and old.     Harold Ford, a 76-year-old African-American retired counselor, said he voted for Mr. Gillum. “He’s not afraid to say he’s liberal,” said Mr. Ford, a registered Democrat. But “he’s not penned in by his politics. He will reach across the aisle to get things done.”     Other voters in Florida had mixed feelings. Neil McAdorey, 54, is a lacrosse coach at Parkland High School in Florida, where a gunman opened fire on students in February, killing 17 people. Mr. McAdorey said he traditionally leans Republican, and voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. He declined to say whom he favored this year but lamented the country’s increased political polarization.     “We need to bring back what was great about America, which was that we were united,” he said. “We haven’t been strongly united in the last year and a half and really even before that.”     And despite low unemployment and an uptick in growth, Mr. McAdorey said the economy also weighs heavily into his thinking. “I have two sons who are entering the workforce and I am very concerned about the opportunities available for them and concerned about jobs,” he said.        
More Election 2018 Coverage        In Ohio, another battleground state Mr. Trump visited Monday in his final campaign swing, there is a heated governor’s race after 2016 GOP presidential candidate         John Kasich    is leaving due to term limits. Republican         Mike DeWine    faces Democrat         Richard Cordray    in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.     Brian McBurney, 61, said he traditionally votes Democratic in his hometown of Massillon, Ohio, but has grown more conservative with age—motivated by issues including tax cuts, health care and immigration. He said he plans to vote Tuesday for Mr. DeWine and Republican incumbent         Rep. Bob Gibbs    in Ohio’s Seventh Congressional District.     “I think we’re better off” with Mr. Trump as president,” Mr. McBurney said. “I don’t agree with everything he does, but I think we’re better off with him than we would have been with (Hillary) Clinton.”     Other contests to watch include races in Indiana and Kentucky, the states where the first returns are expected at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.     America Speaks: Why Voters Went to the PollsThe Wall Street Journal asked voters around the country one question: “Why did you come out to vote today?” Here is what they said.PHOTO: ANNIE FLANAGAN FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL1 of 15•••••     In Texas, Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and         John Culberson    of Houston are both seeking to fend off Democrats in close races. A defeat of         Rep. Will Hurd,    who is facing Democrat         Gina Ortiz-Jones,    would signal a difficult night for Republicans.     Texas also features the showdown between former GOP presidential hopeful         Sen. Ted Cruz    and Democratic         Rep. Beto O’Rourke.    Mr. O’Rourke has benefited from record fundraising but remains behind in polls. No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.     Suzanne Acevedo, a Trump supporter from the Houston suburbs, believes that Republican winning streak isn’t likely to end Tuesday. “Maybe in the future, but I don’t think right now,” she said. “I think we’re still pretty conservative here.”     “Cruz and Trump are right for that,” she said. “Beto, not so much.”     Polls close in the majority of states by 9 p.m. Eastern Time, with mountain and West Coast states wrapping up later.     The late slate includes Alaska, where a combative gubernatorial race is on after         Gov. Bill Walker,    an independent, suspended his re-election bid less than three weeks before the election.     The move came three days after the sudden resignation of         Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott    over what Mr. Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman. The three-way governor’s race is leaning in favor of Republican candidate         Mike Dunleavy    over Democrat Mark Begich but in the recent scandal’s wake, the outcome is hard to call.     Alaska’s polls close at midnight Eastern time.     —Valerie Bauerlein, Joseph De Avila, Joshua Jamerson, Arian Campo-Flores and         Alex Leary    contributed to this article.
