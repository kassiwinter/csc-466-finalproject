WASHINGTON–Federal prosecutors recommended Tuesday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn serve up to six months in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian ambassador.The government's position is a reversal from more than a year ago, when prosecutors urged no prison time for the retired Army lieutenant general. Flynn is one of a half-dozen former aides to President Donald Trump who were convicted or pleaded guilty due to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.Citing Flynn's attempts to "thwart" prosecutors and his "apparent failure to accept responsibility," the government recommended a sentence of up to six months "to promote respect for the law and adequately deter such criminal conduct."He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 28.Last month, a federal judge rejected Flynn's claims that prosecutors forced him to plead guilty and hid evidence that would've exonerated him.Forced to plead guilty? Judge rejects Michael Flynn's claims of a government conspiracy to frame himFlynn reverses course:Michael Flynn's attorney alleges government cover up, while prosecutors leave open possibility of prisonFlynn and his attorney, conservative lawyer and frequent Fox News commentator Sidney Powell, have accused the Justice Department and the FBI of conspiring to frame the former Army general. Powell did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the government's new sentencing recommendation.Flynn pleaded guilty two years ago to lying to the FBI about his communication with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the U.S., in the weeks before Trump took office.Prosecutors charged that Flynn lied to FBI agents when he told them he did not discuss sanctions against Russia with Kislyak, and when he said he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements.Before Flynn's scheduled sentencing in December 2018, prosecutors lauded his cooperation with Mueller's inquiry–noting he had met with investigators 19 times–and his record of exemplary public service."The defendant's record of military and public service distinguish him from every other person who has been charged as part of the (special counsel's) investigation," prosecutors wrote in their initial sentencing filing.The sentencing was postponed after a contentious hearing in which U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan questioned why Flynn's case would be wrapped up when the government still needed his cooperation in a separate case involving a former business partner.Sullivan then went on to savage Flynn's criminal conduct, at one point questioning the retired general's patriotism.“Arguably, you sold your country out,” Sullivan said. "I cannot assure you that, if you proceed today, you will not be sentenced to a period of incarceration."The judge suggested Flynn seek a sentencing delay until his cooperation was complete so it could count in his favor.After that hearing, Flynn hired Powell and went from cooperating with the government to challenging its tactics. Days before the trial of Flynn's former business associate, prosecutors said they wouldn't call him to testify and designated him a co-conspirator.In new court filings, Flynn then asserted that FBI agents ambushed him during an initial interview about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, and he claimed he was pressured into pleading guilty.Sullivan rejected those arguments last month.
