FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – The parents of Michael Brown Jr. have made plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Ferguson and former Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. Attorneys for the family, Anthony D. Gray and Daryl D. Parks addressed the media Thursday morning during a news conference that took place at the Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church.
Michael Brown’s parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Leslie McSpadden were present. They did not speak at the news conference.
According to Gray, they “obviously disagree” with the findings from the Department of Justice’s investigation citing the same systematic issues taking place in Ferguson existed during the August 9, 2014 shooting.
Their plan is to demonstrate in a court of law, to “reasonably minded people,” that officer Wilson’s choice to use deadly force was unreasonable an unnecessary. No criminal charges were filed against Wilson, either by a St. Louis County grand jury or the federal government. But the burden of proof is much smaller in a civil case, generally requiring the plaintiffs to prove negligence by a ”preponderance of the evidence” instead of beyond a reasonable doubt.
According to the attorneys, the lawsuit will be filed soon.
