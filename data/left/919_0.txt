   Hosts, contributors, and analysts at MSNBC and Fox News spoke about against the arrest of CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos, and photojournalist Leonel Mendez in Minneapolis Friday morning.
The journalists were arrested while live on air covering the Minneapolis protests — before being released with an apology from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.
In a statement, MSNBC declared, “We condemn the arrest and detention of a crew of @CNN journalists who were simply doing their jobs in a tough situation on the ground in Minneapolis. This is a time when the work of journalists continues to be necessary to inform and educate the public.”
“Any infringement on press freedom flies in the face of all of our freedoms and should not be condoned. We support and stand with our colleagues,” the network added.
Fox News issued its own statement Friday morning: “FOX News Channel has always supported the First Amendment and this instance is no different. We denounce the detainment of the CNN crew and stand with them in protecting the right to report without fear or favor.”

— Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) May 29, 2020 Don’t forget, Minneapolis Police arrested a CNN crew, who were professionally doing their job, self-identified themselves and abided by police instructions FASTER than they have arrested the police involved in the killing of #georgefloyd

Talent at Fox News called the arrest “BULLSHIT,” “Insane,” and “Outrageous.”
The arrest of a @CNN crew in Minneapolis this morning was absolutely uncalled for and unacceptable.

At CBS News, Ed O’Keefe commented, “This is a professional journalist working for a network that regularly reports live from global hotspots. Wars, riots, coups. I can’t recall one of its correspondents ever being arrested live on TV for doing their job. But you do you, Minnesota.”
