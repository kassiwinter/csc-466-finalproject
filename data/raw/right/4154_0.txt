Let's go big, be bold, and do good! pic.twitter.com/gk9SPDT4FN— Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) April 8, 2019Not everyone was excited about the what they saw. In fact, Swalwell has made a name for himself as anti-gunner and, like practically every other 2020 Democrat, plans to run on the gun control issue. While he wants to be known as a strong supporter of "gun safety," his claim to fame is wanting to nuke gun owners. Meet wannabe nuker-in-chief Eric Swalwell. pic.twitter.com/rMAYQJEWRA— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) April 9, 2019Eric Swalwell, the guy who said he would nuke America in a tweet, has just announced he is running for President.2020 is going to be hilarious ??— Ryan Fournier (@RyanAFournier) April 9, 2019Swalwell campaign slogan: “Turn in your guns or I’ll nuke you” https://t.co/nKUbDiiWaT— Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) April 4, 2019Nice.
