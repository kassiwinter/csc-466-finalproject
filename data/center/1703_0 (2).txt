Updated with comment from Obama campaign.The name-calling between President Barack Obama's campaign and that of his Republican rival Mitt Romney has entered the phase of righteous indignation.Eric Fehrnstrom, a top adviser to Mr. Romney, accused the Obama campaign Friday of peddling "unbelievable exaggerations that diminish the office of the president and insult the American people. "I don't think a world champion limbo dancer could get any lower than the Obama campaign right now," Mr. Fehrnstrom told reporters at a briefing to walk the press through Mr. Romney's upcoming tour of four critical swing states.           The Romney adviser was responding to a series of Obama attacks, including an ad recently released by a super PAC supporting the president. In the ad, a laid-off worker appears to ascribe the blame for his wife's death to losing his job at a steel mill owned by the private-equity firm Mr. Romney founded, Bain Capital. (In an interview with the Journal, the worker said he doesn't blame Mr. Romney for her death.)     This latest salvo comes after the candidates themselves offered "Romney Hood" -- a reverse Robin Hood of sorts -- and "Obama-loney" into the American lexicon. And Obama advisers spent the early part of the week lobbing similar charges at the Romney camp for, in their words, grossly misleading voters with an ad that accuses Mr. Obama of gutting the work requirements in welfare because his administration issued new guidance that gives states more flexibility to opt out of federal mandates if they can get people back to work.     By engaging in these attacks, Mr. Fehrnstrom argued Friday that the president had squandered his brand from the last campaign that he was a transformational figure who appealed to voters on both sides of the partisan divide and promised not to engage in the petty bickering that defines American politics.     "Obama has squandered what has always been one of his key attributes – that he was a different kind of politician who was going to take us to a better place," Mr. Fehrnstrom said. "Obama said he was going to change the tone in Washington, and he has done that: He's taken it from bad to worse."      The Romney adviser said the campaign would respond "forcefully to Obama's ugly distortions and lies," before promising to run a race that focuses more on distinct policy differences.     Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, called the Romney's campaign's statements "faux outrage." She added that the Romney campaign "has questioned whether the President understands what it is to be American, attacked his patriotism, and is currently running an ad that a former president and authors of the welfare-to-work legislation have called a flat-out lie. When the Romney campaign finally reaches the high ground, we look forward to greeting them there."     Mr. Romney embarks Friday on a tour of four battlegrounds the president won in 2008: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. The first event is Saturday. The Republican may need to sweep all four to have a chance of winning the White House in the fall. Instead of focusing on reliably conservative corners of these states, Mr. Romney will spend the bulk of this tour talking to voters in regions the president won.     "We're playing on their territory," a senior adviser to Mr. Romney said.     Mr. Obama held solid leads over his Republican rival in three recent national polls, but the Romney campaign pointed to state-level data that seems to bolster their chances. For example, President Obama's approval rating trails his disapproval rating in all four states, citing Gallup numbers. (See the Gallup rundown here.) In all four states, ad spending in July outpaced what the presidential contenders' campaigns spent on television commercials in October 2008.     A senior strategist to Mr. Romney also warned the assembled reporters that it's still too early to make definitive judgments about the race because both parties have yet to hold conventions and they haven't had any debates.     "Guys, it's the middle of summer," the adviser said. "It's the doldrums."     The Romney campaign wouldn't engage questions on the topic that has everyone guessing: Whom the candidate will tap as his running-mate.     "I don't have any guidance for you on that except to say you could download the VP app," Mr. Fehrnstrom said, referring to a new online tool from the Romney camp that promises to alert supporters of the pick before anyone else knows.     Below, two widely debated ads. The first appears to tie a woman's death to her husband's layoff at a Bain owned steel mill. The second accuses Obama of weakening welfare rules.
