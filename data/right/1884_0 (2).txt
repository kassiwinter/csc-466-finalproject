 Fresh off of Vice President Joe Biden's "they'll put ya'll back in chains" comments yesterday in Danville, Virginia, Mitt Romney hit back at the Obama campaign, hard, telling President Obama to take his campaign of division, hate and anger back to Chicago. "He is intellectually exhausted, out of ideas and out of energy."
"The President is taking things to a new low. His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency."
"This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like. President Obama knows better, promised better and America deserves better."
"His campaign strategy is to smash America apart and then try to cobble together 51 percent of the pieces." 
Some Republican strategists were worried Mitt Romney may not fight hard enough against the Obama machine, I think it's fair to say he's proven them wrong.
Not surprisingly, the Obama campaign is still defending Biden's comments and calling Romney's response "unhinged." Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said, "Gov. Romney's comments tonight seemed unhinged."
