The U.S. Treasury Department told Congress on Wednesday it will remove sanctions imposed on three Russian companies tied to an oligarch.The companies—aluminum giant         United Co. Rusal    PLC, its parent EN+ Group PLC and JSC EuroSibEnergo, a Russian energy company—were put on the U.S. sanctions list in April because of their ownership or control by Russian oligarch         Oleg Deripaska.     Mr. Deripaska remains under sanctions, but the companies agreed to a sweeping deal centered on severing his ties with them that will result in their removal from the blacklist, the Treasury said.     The removals, expected to take place in 30 days, are based on a change in factual circumstances “in line with longstanding U.S. sanctions precedent” that “is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign policy,” the Treasury said in a letter to Congress.               The removals come as the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions against 15 Russian agents, including a former Russian intelligence officer who the U.S. said reports to Mr. Deripaska and led business negotiations on his behalf.     The Treasury had issued licenses at least six times since April, allowing the companies to continue operating while they worked with the U.S. government to reach a satisfactory divestment plan. The deal would be a binding agreement between the companies and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Treasury’s sanctions office, the department said.      The agreement requires Mr. Deripaska to reduce his ownership stake in EN+ to 44.95% from 70%, and he is prohibited from increasing his stake. And in reducing his stake, Mr. Deripaska won’t receive cash for his shares nor from future dividends issued by the companies, according to the agreement.     EN+ is “the linchpin” underlying the sanctions designations on all three companies, the letter said, because Mr. Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership in Rusal and none at all in EuroSibEnergo.     “These latest developments mark an important milestone” in EN+ Group’s efforts to be removed from the sanctions list, the company said in a statement Thursday. The company also cautioned that Congress could still seek amendments to the conditions that could be “material in nature.” EuroSibEnergo couldn't be reached for comment.     The agreement also requires sweeping governance changes. Mr. Deripaska’s voting rights in EN+ will be limited. EN+ will create a 12-person board mostly independent of him and he will be bound to commitments severing his ability to control the company. In addition, EN+ and Rusal agreed to a number of transparency measures, including the provision to the Treasury of quarterly earnings reports, board minutes and notifications of any change in board composition.     EN+ will continue to control Rusal, according to the agreement, through a 56.88% stake, and it will retain the right to nominate the chief executive. EN+ also will use that majority control to create a 14-person board, most of whom will have no ties to Mr. Deripaska. And Rusal’s current chairman will step down; the new chair will be held by one of the new directors.     EuroSibEnergo, which is wholly owned by EN+, will provide the Treasury with monthly certifications they are not acting on behalf of Mr. Deripaska.     The companies will face severe consequences if they fail to comply with the agreement, including being put back on the sanctions list, Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    said in a statement.     “OFAC maintains the ability under the terms of the agreement to have unprecedented levels of transparency into operations,” he said.     The deal provides a road map for other companies to pursue sanctions removal if they’re not actively involved in illicit conduct, said David Murray, a vice president at consulting firm Financial Integrity Network who previously served as the director of Treasury’s illicit finance office.      “What we have is an outline of expectations that OFAC may have for other companies targeted solely because they’re owned or controlled by someone on the sanctions list,” Mr. Murray said.     Aluminum prices, which fell to a 16-month low before the sanctions announcement was made Wednesday, could head lower once the sanctions are lifted.     Some analysts had predicted aluminum prices would rise again in 2019, based in part on the sanctions against Rusal, the world’s second-largest aluminum producer.     “If (the sanctions) had not been solved, at least half of Rusal’s production would have had to shut down,” said         Lloyd O’Carroll,    an independent analyst for the metals industry. “That’s not happening now.”     —Kirk Maltais contributed to this article.
