WASHINGTON—At least three major universities said they wouldn’t accept funds allocated to them under the coronavirus stimulus package after President Trump began pressuring Harvard University over the money. The president incorrectly suggested the aid was intended to go to small businesses, but it was allocated to the schools as part of a stimulus provision for higher education. Harvard said Wednesday that it would ask the Education Department to reallocate the nearly $9 million the institution would have gotten, noting that it had neither applied for the money nor received it. The school had said it would use 100% of those funds as aid to students whose finances have been affected during the pandemic. “We have previously said that Harvard, like other institutions, will face significant financial challenges due to the pandemic and economic crisis it has caused,” a spokesman said. “We are also concerned however, that the intense focus by politicians and others on Harvard in connection with this program may undermine participation in a relief effort that Congress created and the president signed into law for the purpose of helping students and institutions whose financial challenges in the coming months may be most severe.”     The school asked that “special consideration” be given to struggling institutions in Massachusetts.                The money was allocated to schools based on the number of low-income students enrolled as well as total enrollment.      Stanford University and Princeton University, which were allocated $7.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, issued similar statements.     “Stanford is facing significant financial pressures during this time of unprecedented uncertainty,” Stanford spokesman         Ernest Miranda    said in an email. “However, we realize that this crisis represents an existential threat for many of the smaller colleges and universities.”     Princeton University never requested the money, hasn’t received any and won’t accept it, spokesman         Ben Chang    said Wednesday.      Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    on Fox Business Network said he had spoken to the president of Harvard that morning and that the university was considering whether it should keep the money. But he also sought to clarify President Trump’s comments in a briefing on Tuesday, in which Mr. Trump suggested Harvard was taking money intended to go to small businesses. Mr. Mnuchin noted that Harvard in fact had been allocated money under a different program in the stimulus bill intended to aid higher education institutions.     In the Tuesday briefing, Mr. Trump interjected as Mr. Mnuchin was praising         Shake Shack Inc.    for saying it would return a $10 million loan from the $350 billion federal coronavirus aid program, the Paycheck Protection Program, intended to boost small businesses.

I want Harvard to pay the money back.” He suggested the money for Harvard was intended to go to small businesses. “This is meant for workers,” he said. “This isn’t meant for one of the richest institutions, not only—far beyond schools—in the world.”     After the briefing, Harvard said it neither applied for nor received funds through the Paycheck Protection Program. “Like most colleges and universities, Harvard has been allocated funds as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund,” a spokesman said.      As of Wednesday, 2,960 institutions had applied for the student emergency grant funding. The Department of Education said it had awarded funds to 318 schools, totaling $751,268,128.     On Wednesday, the Harvard spokesman said the university first learned of its allocation when the Department of Education posted it online earlier this month.                                                  ‘I want Harvard to pay the money back,’ President Trump said Tuesday.

The White House declined to comment on whether the president had confused the two programs.     Mr. Trump, for whom railing against elites is a cornerstone of his campaign speeches, appeared to relish the prospect of a showdown with one of the top universities in the country. Later Tuesday evening, he tweeted that Harvard, which has a $40 billion endowment, should return the money and wrote: “Their whole ‘endowment’ system should be looked at!” He also retweeted a news organization that had posted a clip of his Harvard remarks from the briefing.     Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump thanked Harvard, Stanford and other institutions that said they wouldn’t take their share of the funds. “They’re not accepting the money and that’s great,” he said in a briefing.
