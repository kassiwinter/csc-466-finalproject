                                                                                                                                         COLUMBIA, South Carolina — The mood was excited and merry at the Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters at midday, with state official reporting light turnout in Saturday’s Democratic presidential primary that likely helps her score another win.                                                                                                                                                      Mrs. Clinton led rival Sen. Bernard Sanders by more than 20 percent in most polls heading into the first-in-the-South primary election, and Mr. Sanders had all but given up on the state and shifted focus to crucial multi-state contests that begin with Super Tuesday next week.                                                                                                                                                      “I’m feeling very good. I’ve never felt so relaxed before a primary before,” said Lana Moresky, a volunteer who traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to work for the Clinton campaign in South Carolina.                                                                                                                                                                    “I just want it to be 20 percent,” added Eve Stacey, a volunteer from the Columbia area, referring to the margin of victory                                                                                                                              Mrs. Clinton’s advantage in South Carolina comes from her expected overwhelming support from black voters, who make up about 55 percent of the state’s Democratic primary electorate.                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. Sander hopes to close the gap with Mrs. Clinton in the Palmetto State to blunt her momentum and demonstrate his viability heading into the March contests, when more than enough delegates to clinch the nomination will be at stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 State election officials said turnout appeared generally low throughout the state, although there likely would be pockets of high turnout in places such as Charleston, S.C.
