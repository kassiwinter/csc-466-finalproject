Story highlightsCNN has updated its rating of battleground statesTwo states that had moved toward Clinton are back in the "battleground" columnWashingtonOne week after we moved Nevada and Florida from "battleground" to "lean Democratic," both states appear to be snapping back to their traditional toss-up status. Our new CNN electoral outlook places both states back in the "battleground" category and increases the up-for-grabs turf to six states and two congressional districts worth a total of 87 electoral votes.What's changed?-- Florida (29) moves from "lean Democratic" to "battleground"-- Nevada (6) moves from "lean Democratic" to "battleground"Road to 270: Electoral College mapNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.The state of playClinton had not yet finished her two-day swing through the Sunshine State before her campaign let it be known that she would be back in Florida this weekend.Florida is also one of the handful of states where the Clinton campaign remains heavily on the air with campaign advertising and where it announced today that two closing argument ads will begin to be seen across the state.A new Bloomberg Politics poll putting Donald Trump a couple of points ahead of Hillary Clinton was some of the most welcome news the Trump campaign had to tout this week.Florida's 29 electoral votes are the biggest prize on the map among competitive states and both campaigns plan to fight it out there all the way through November 8.In Nevada, polls continue to show it is a margin-of-error race between Clinton and Trump and both candidates are expected back in the Silver State before Election Day.A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows a dead heat with each candidate getting 43% of likely voters.As Trump continues to shore up his Republican support and improve his standing among Hispanics (though still losing this group by a wide margin), he is ensuring Nevada remains competitive all the way through Election Day.With the new changes to the CNN electoral outlook, our current snapshot has Clinton at 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction. Trump has a total of 179 electoral votes from the states either solidly or leaning in his direction.
