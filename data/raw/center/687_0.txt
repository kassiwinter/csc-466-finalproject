By Janet Hook and Carol E. LeeA crack in Republican unity on taxes broke Tuesday when a senior House Republican, Tom Cole of Oklahoma, privately urged his colleagues to accede to the White House's demand they pass an extension of current tax rates just for income up to $250,000.                                                 Rep. Tom Cole          Associated Press                                                                                                             Mr. Cole's comments represented a significant break from the GOP leadership's insistence that all rates be extended, including the upper brackets that Democrats want eventually to increase.     Although many Republicans have said they would be willing to include increased revenues in a year-end budget deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff--a swath of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect at the New Year--they have refused to accept a rate increase for any bracket even temporarily.          Mr. Cole, whose comments were first reported by Politico and confirmed by his staff, represents a notable voice in his party. He's a respected political strategist who once headed its campaign arm. He spoke out on a day when Democrats dug in and showed little willingness to give ground to Republicans' demands in the current budget talks.     Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), a rare liberal who has supported changes in Medicare and other entitlements as part of a broad budget deal, made clear he wouldn't back them under a short-term agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff.      White House officials suggested in a closed-door meeting with supporters that talks wouldn't heat up for about a week. In the meeting, President          Barack Obama     said he considered the fiscal-cliff debate a defining moment of his presidency.     "The next four weeks could define the next four years," Mr. Obama told a small group of Democrats after joining their meeting in the Roosevelt Room with his top aides, according to a participant.     Republicans criticized what they saw as a lack of progress and girded for a public-relations initiative of their own to galvanize small-business owners in support of their fiscal-cliff proposals, in particular their opposition to raising the top income-tax rates.     "If the president wants a solution to the challenges of the moment, the people he needs to be talking to are the members of his own party, so he can convince them of the need to act,'' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).      Republicans have since refused to budge on a demand that tax rates remain unchanged, while Democrats insist that upper rates must rise. Republicans have called for big changes in entitlement programs; most Democrats have refused to offer any until Republicans give more ground on taxes.     In his discussion with Democratic supporters Tuesday, Mr. Obama showed no inclination to give ground. He repeated his threat to veto legislation that doesn't make upper-income Americans pay more in taxes and promised he wouldn't accept "a bad deal."     White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told the group that the White House should know in about seven to 10 days how much the Republicans will be willing to compromise on taxes, according to attendees. Senior White House adviser David Plouffe warned the Democrats of a big fight ahead which required the party to stick together, attendees said.     Mr. Durbin, the Senate majority whip and a close Obama ally, was one of the few senior Democratic liberals willing to entertain big changes in Medicare. In a speech Tuesday at Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, he said Democrats "should be willing to talk about ways to ensure the long-term viability of Medicare and Medicaid."     At the same time, he said such changes should be dealt with next year, rather than in a hurried manner during the current lame-duck session of Congress.     White House press secretary Jay Carney said he hadn't seen Mr. Durbin's remarks but said Mr. Obama wants a deal that includes changes to entitlements.     Complicating the already complex budget talks, Mr. Durbin said the year-end budget agreement will have to include an increase in the country's statutory borrowing limit to avoid another fight when the federal debt ceiling is reached, likely early next year. "The president isn't going to sign off on an agreement that doesn't provide some certainty on the debt ceiling," he said.     A GOP House leadership aide said Republicans would insist on greater concessions from Democrats, in addition to any fiscal-cliff agreement, to include the debt ceiling in any deal.     Related: Rep.
