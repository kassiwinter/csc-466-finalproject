                                                  Governor Rick Perry addresses a large audience in attendance at the National Right To Life Convention Thursday, June 27, 2013, in Grapevine, Texas.          AP                                                                                                                                  Updated July 7, 2013 2:28 pm ET                 Texas Governor Rick Perry Sunday expressed confidence the state legislature, convened for a new special session, will pass an abortion law blocked last month by a filibuster.     "Texas is a place where we defend life," Mr. Perry said about the legislation that would establish new abortion restrictions on "Fox News Sunday."      The Republican governor said opponents of the measure had packed the state Senate's gallery in support of the filibuster led by Democrat state Senator Wendy Davis. These opponents repeatedly disrupted the proceedings on the Senate floor with "the express purpose of running out the clock," Mr. Perry said. "Never in the history of Texas have [we] seen that type of mob rule."     Mr. Perry said such disruptions will not be allowed again. "We will get this done," he said.          Mr. Perry, who has said he will make an announcement regarding his political future Monday, declined to give any advance details. "Tomorrow in San Antonio I will announce my plans," he said. The governor faces re-election in 2014 if he decides to run again.     The onetime contender for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 2012 also didn't rule out trying again in 2016. "Certainly that's an option," he said, though he added he was currently focused on several Texas legislative initiatives.        Copyright Â©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
