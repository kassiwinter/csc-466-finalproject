                                                                                                                                         President Obama is taking his gun-control message on the road, with a planned first stop in Democrat-leading Minnesota, at the Minneapolis Police Departmentâ€™s Special Operations Center, according to media reports.                                                                                                                                                      There, Mr. Obama is expected to call for a ban on assault weapons and a mandate for national background checks on all gun buyers, Newsmax reports. This is the first stop on a planned national public relations campaign for Congress to enact more gun control laws, Newsmax said.                                                                                                                                           Minnesota officials have been seeking ways to tighten gun laws for years, Newsmax reported.
