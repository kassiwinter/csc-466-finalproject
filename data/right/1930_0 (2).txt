           One of Donald Trump's top advisers says that he doesn't think that the real estate mogul finds the comment by Mike Huckabee about the Iran deal offensive. "I don't think so," Michael Cohen, executive president of the Trump organization, told Chris Cuomo on "New Day" on CNN on Monday morning about whether or not Trump was offended by the statement.
Huckabee said an interview with Breitbart on Saturday that by pushing for the Iranian nuclear deal, President Barack Obama "will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven." 
Trump's campaign head told CNN that Trump supports Huckabee's statement because "we've been there."
"My father is a Holocaust survivor, and I can tell you, there’s that old statement, ‘Never again,’" Cohen said. "What Trump is trying to say is a nuclear Iran is the destruction of this world. What we need is a strong America. If you have a strong America, you have a strong world. If you have a weak America, we're going to have a weak world," he explained.
"I think what he’s doing is he’s really making the point that what Secretary of State [John] Kerry is doing in trying to push this agenda for Iran — it's a disaster,” Trump's campaign manager said. 
"I'm not offended by the words, and I lost 90 percent of my family at that point," he added. "I'm concerned, I'm truly concerned not just for this country, but the countries all around the world."
