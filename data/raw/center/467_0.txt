WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser         John Bolton,    described by witnesses who testified at President         Trump’s    impeachment hearings as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine, said he would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers.Mr. Bolton’s statement Monday spurred partisan wrangling over how the Senate impeachment trial would be conducted and added pressure on Republicans to call the former official. Mr. Bolton has previously conveyed that he has new information about the White House’s Ukraine policy.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat impact do you think John Bolton’s testimony would have in the Senate impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.        The Democratic-led House approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress impeachment articles in December alleging Mr. Trump tried to enlist a foreign power to help him in this year’s election. The chamber had sought Mr. Bolton’s testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment when he declined to testify.     “Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,” Mr. Bolton said in a statement. He noted that he had weighed Mr. Trump’s attempt to block aides and former advisers from testifying to Congress against lawmakers’ request that he testify about the White House’s Ukraine policy.               The White House didn’t respond to a question about Mr. Bolton’s statement.      House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) has held off on sending the approved articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying she wanted to see more details on rules for a Senate trial. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber’s Democratic leader, has demanded the Senate request documents and testimony from the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn’t committed to calling witnesses in the impeachment trial.     Mr. McConnell reiterated on Monday his position that requests for witnesses should be addressed after the trial begins, as during former President Clinton’s impeachment trial.     “That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump,” he said on the Senate floor. New witness material was used in the Clinton impeachment after approval by the Senate.      It would take a simple majority of the 100 senators to approve any new witnesses, meaning four Republicans would be needed if all 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats backed new testimony. On Monday, some Republicans remained wary of introducing new evidence after the House concluded its probe.      “Our inquiry should be limited to whatever evidence or testimony they used when they voted on the articles of impeachment,” said         Sen. Marco Rubio    (R., Fla.). “If the House thinks there’s additional testimony and so forth then they could take the item up again.”     Others signaled they wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton.         Related        “He has firsthand information, and assuming articles of impeachment reach the Senate, I’d like to hear what he has to say,”         Sen. Mitt Romney    (R., Utah) said.              Sen. John Cornyn    (R., Texas) said he would be open to hearing from Mr. Bolton, anticipating he would be “a good witness for the president.”     The House could also call Mr. Bolton to testify, though Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee who led the investigation, said Monday that it “makes sense” for Mr. Bolton to testify in the Senate trial      Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong, tweeting on Monday that the impeachment process was a “con game by the Dems to help with the Election!”     Mr. Bolton, according to testimony from other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation, was alarmed at a parallel Ukraine policy overseen by Mr. Trump’s personal attorney         Rudy Giuliani    aimed at pressuring Kyiv to launch investigations that would benefit him politically, including a probe of Democratic presidential candidate      Joe Biden        and his son. Mr. Bolton referred to the matter as a “drug deal,” according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, who had been Mr. Bolton’s top Eurasia specialist.     Mr. Bolton, whom Mr. Trump fired in September after nearly a year and a half on the job, “was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations” about the Ukraine matter “as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,” Mr. Bolton’s attorney         Charles Cooper    wrote to the House’s general counsel, Douglas Letter, in November.     Mr. Schumer has called for testimony from three new witnesses besides Mr. Bolton: acting White House chief of staff         Mick Mulvaney    ; Mr. Mulvaney’s aide Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.     “It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton, and the other three witnesses, as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,” Mr. Schumer said.     Mr. Bolton’s acknowledgment of the Senate’s power to compel him to appear sidesteps a brewing conflict between the branches of government over their rights and privileges in the impeachment proceedings. Precedent on whether a president can invoke legal privilege over documents or testimony in an impeachment process, particularly a Senate trial, is scant.     In 1974, the Nixon Justice Department concluded that “a constitutional confrontation of the highest magnitude would ensue” if a president tried to withhold information or testimony from the Congress in an impeachment trial by claiming executive privilege over the objection of the Senate.

Over the break, two Senate Republicans—Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine—indicated they would bring an independent mind-set to a trial, suggesting that witnesses could be called if enough Republicans vote for motions by Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents.     Ms. Collins said Monday the Senate should vote on possible witnesses after the trial begins, supporting Mr. McConnell.      “I think that we will decide at that stage who we need to hear from,” she said.     In the House impeachment testimony, witnesses described Mr. Bolton as hostile to the Ukraine pressure campaign. According to witnesses, Mr. Bolton abruptly ended a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian government officials after U.S. ambassador to the European Union         Gordon Sondland    linked a meeting between Ukraine President         Volodymyr Zelensky    and Mr. Trump to Ukraine’s willingness to announced investigations that Mr. Trump sought.     During the House probe, Mr. Bolton declined to testify voluntarily. In his statement Monday explaining his decision to come to the Senate, Mr. Bolton said he believed he had run out of time on seeking a judicial ruling.      “It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts,” he said.     —Byron Tau and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.
