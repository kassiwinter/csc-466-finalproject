         WASHINGTON—President Trump denounced the mass shooting inside a Pittsburgh synagogue as a “wicked act of pure evil and anti-Semitic,” and for the fourth consecutive day condemned political violence.     Expressing disbelief a deadly shooting would happen “at a sacred house of worship on the holy day of Sabbath,” Mr. Trump said that “there must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism.”      Mr. Trump’s remarks came during an address to the Future Farmers of America, an agricultural youth organization, in Indiana as part of a series of events he is attending in states with competitive U.S. Senate races. Mr. Trump said he considered canceling a campaign rally later Saturday in Illinois, but decided he had “an obligation” to attend.     “We can’t let evil change our life and change our schedule. We can’t do that. We have to go,” Mr. Trump said.               In Indiana and Illinois appearances, Mr. Trump said he was inspired to keep his schedule in part because he remembered the New York Stock Exchange reopened the day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The NYSE and Nasdaq reopened on Sept. 17.                                         President Trump spoke after the Saturday morning shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better,” he said.

He didn’t answer when asked when that trip would happen.     Mr. Trump has spent much of the past week calling on Americans to unify, alternating with attacks on Democrats and the media, after Democratic lawmakers, actors and a media organization were targeted by mail bombs from one of the president’s supporters. On Friday, law enforcement arrested Cesar Altieri Sayoc, a 56-year-old Florida man suspected of sending the suspicious packages.     At a rally in Charlotte on Friday, Mr. Trump called for the nation to “unify as a nation in peace, love and harmony.” He also said ”radical leftists ... unleash violence and mayhem“ and blamed the media for negative reports about his administration that ”drive people apart and undermine healthy debate.”     On Saturday, he said Americans could come together without appearing weak.     “We must all rise above the hate, move past our divisions and embrace our common destiny as Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “It doesn’t mean that we can’t fight hard and be strong and say what’s on our mind, but we have to always remember those elements, we have to remember the elements of love and dignity and respect and so many others.”     The president has been briefed on the shootings and is receiving regular updates from Mike Burnett, senior director for counterterrorism, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.     Before leaving Washington, Mr. Trump responded to the synagogue shooting by saying the U.S. needed tougher death penalty laws. He also said that there may have been fewer killed inside the synagogue if there had been armed guards.     “If they had some kind of protection inside the temple maybe it could have been different,” Mr. Trump told reporters. Four police officers were injured in the shooting.      Mr. Trump said the country needs to “stiffen up” laws regarding the death penalty. “They should pay the ultimate price,” he said.
