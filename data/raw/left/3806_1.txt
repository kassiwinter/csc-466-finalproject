A group of Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh, a city still reeling from the bloody attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue that left 11 people dead, have published an open letter telling President Donald Trump not to come until he denounces white nationalism.Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, however, said he would welcome a visit from the president.The letter, posted on the liberal Jewish action website Bend the Arc, was signed by 11 Jewish leaders and had drawn more than 22,000 additional online signatures Monday morning."For the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement," the letter says. "You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence."More:Accused gunman faces hearing as prosecutors press for death penaltyMore:Post Pittsburgh shooting, Trump again blames media for 'anger,' It adds that Trump is "not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism."The letter accused Trump of deliberately undermining the the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities."Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country," the letter says. "President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities."Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue, said Trump was a "purveyor of hate speech" and that she would not welcome him.Myers, however, said the president of the United States would always be welcome."I'm a citizen. He's my president," Myers told CNN. "He is certainly welcome."Trump in recent days has referred to himself as a "nationalist." Critics of Trump have blamed contentious rhetoric aimed at migrants, political foes and the media for sharply dividing the nation and prompting unbalanced people to consider violence.Trump took to Twitter on Monday to blame what he termed inaccurate and fraudulent reporting by the news media for the "great anger" dividing the nation."The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly," Trump tweeted. "That will do much to put out the flame of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!"
