         The White House is planning a big push in the weeks ahead for a comprehensive immigration-law overhaul that would include a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants.     The         Obama    administration sees overhauling immigration laws as a priority for 2013—one that President Barack Obama is expected to tout in his State of the Union address to Congress on Feb. 12. The White House is also planning a full-fledged public push for an immigration package, complete with presidential events early in the year, administration officials said.      The administration supports legislation that would include a process for granting citizenship to undocumented workers who pay back taxes and fines, as well as a better system to help employers verify whether an applicant is eligible to work, a guest-worker program, and additional visas for high-tech workers and others to relieve a backlog.     The White House has been looking to a bipartisan group in the Senate, where legislation is expected to move first. Senators including Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.),         Bob Menendez    (D., N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and John McCain (R., Ariz.) have been meeting in recent weeks to hammer out a compromise, with the goal of advancing legislation this spring.               A senior administration official said Sunday that no decision has been made as to whether the administration will give lawmakers legislative language to guide their efforts or provide more general legislative principles as lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, search for bipartisan agreement.     Sen. Majority Leader         Harry Reid    (D., Nev.) said in a televised interview this weekend an immigration overhaul was his top priority. "It's going to be the first thing on the agenda," he said on Nevada Week in Review, a public broadcasting program. Mr. Reid said he saw a chance for agreement between Republicans and Democrats on the issue.     One complication: While the White House wants a comprehensive package, many Republicans want to move in small steps.                  Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a GOP rising star, has advocated a piecemeal approach, with three or four pieces of legislation that would give some undocumented immigrants visas, require them to pay taxes and penalties, and eventually open the path to citizenship.              Angela Kelley,    an immigration expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, described support for guest-worker programs as a potential "poke in the eye" of labor unions. "It is going to be a tough balancing act to keep labor happy, given their wariness of temporary worker programs," she said.
