 That may explain the White House's somewhat muted response – before Tuesday, President Barack Obama hasn't publicly addressed the issue since April 28, when he was asked about it during a trip to Asia. (President Obama is meeting with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki Tuesday at 10 a.m. and will deliver a statement at 10:45 a.m.)     It's become clear in recent days, however, that leaders on both sides of the aisle have woken up to the potential political fallout of the VA scandal.          Since Thursday, the White House has put its chief of staff on TV to publicly declare the president is "madder than hell;" dispatched a senior presidential aide to the VA to conduct an assessment of the situation; and toned down its expressions of Mr. Obama's confidence in VA Secretary Eric Shinseki. It's a marked shift from previous weeks when the White House appeared to have no discernible effort to contain the crisis, let alone get ahead of it.                                                 Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki          Getty Images                                                                                                             At the same time, Republicans have stepped up their criticism of Mr. Obama, focusing on the daily turns in the debacle and intensifying pressure on the president to make a dramatic change. That's also a departure from the early weeks of the VA controversy, when lawmakers largely held their fire and the American Legion seemed out on a limb in calling for Mr. Shinseki's resignation.     But as the allegations widen, so, too, is criticism of Mr. Obama's handling of the VA matter. Even members of the president's own party have begun to question his approach to the issue.     Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran who served at the VA under Mr. Obama and is from his home state of Illinois, told the Washington Post this week when asked about the president's handling of veterans issues: "I think he's relied on Secretary Shinseki, but we could use his personal attention at this point."     Rep. Gary Peters, a Democrat who is running for the Senate in Michigan, told veterans this week that the revelations about the VA are "beyond troubling."      Even "The Daily Show" host, Jon Stewart, seen as an ally in the White House, has been sharply critical of the administration.     The immediate challenge for the White House is to keep the controversy from impacting the November elections. Not only is the VA issue eclipsing a White House economic agenda that's supposed to frame the choice for voters, it's also doing nothing to help motivate Democrats.     But there's a potential legacy problem for Mr. Obama, as well. White House officials recognize that the VA controversy could taint Mr. Obama's record on issues he's championed since he was a candidate and in which he's invested a lot of time as president.     Having gained prominence on the national stage, in part, by his opposition to the Iraq war and having never served in the military, Mr. Obama took pains to find ways to connect with veterans and active troops as commander in chief. He learned how to properly salute. He sought changes at the VA. First lady Michelle Obama made veterans a key focus of her platform to raise awareness of military families' needs.     "The personal attention is there," White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday when asked about Ms. Duckworth's comments.     The president's aides had considered having Mr. Obama publicly address the controversy this week, and he finally made comments on Wednesday morning. But waiting for three weeks, while the pressure built, only raised the stakes on what he would ultimately say.
