 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has done a pretty good job throughout the past week embarrassing the United States on the world stage over the crisis in Syria and now, he's written an op-ed in the New York Times to further prove his points and explain his position. Naturally, his words are laced with communism and slams against the United States. My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this. I carefully studied his address to the nation on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States’ policy is “what makes America different. It’s what makes us exceptional.” It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. Just a nice little reminder that Putin is a former KGB officer. But the worst part? Obama and Putin might not agree on Syria, but they have a lot in common when it comes to defining American exceptionalism.  Recommended Townhall Video
