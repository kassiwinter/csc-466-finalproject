TEL AVIV, Israel—The Israel leg of Mitt Romney's trip abroad, which begins Saturday, will offer him a chance to explain how he would strengthen ties with Israel's government and demonstrate that he can do a better job of maintaining strong ties with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than President Barack Obama has.But the presumptive Republican White House nominee will have to tread carefully in his appearances with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. He will try to highlight how his approach would differ from Mr. Obama's without explicitly criticizing the president, which Mr. Romney has pledged he wouldn't do while abroad. Moreover, after months of lambasting the president's approach, Mr. Romney will face more-detailed questions about how his own policies would diverge from the current White House occupant's.     Messrs. Romney and Netanyahu have a long and cordial relationship, having begun their careers together after business school at a Boston consulting firm and remaining in touch since. During the primary season, Mr. Romney referred to the Israeli leader as "my friend."               At the same time, though, some Israeli leaders have expressed growing appreciation for increased diplomatic and military support from the U.S. in the past year, boosting Mr. Obama's image here.     The president bolstered the relationship Friday with a made-for-media moment in the Oval Office, as he signed legislation that enhances U.S.-Israel security cooperation. Mr. Obama said the move underscores "our unshakable commitment to Israel security" and noted the administration's transfer this week of an additional $70 million the administration secured for the Israelis' Iron Dome missile-defense system.     The Obama administration in recent months also has supplied advanced bombs to Israel and expanded military exercises between the countries.     Mr. Romney's trip is meant in part to advance a Republican effort to make inroads with American Jewish voters who normally vote Democratic. He also will be looking to regain his footing after his foreign trip was knocked off stride this week by his remarks questioning the preparedness of London for the start of the Olympics.     With an agenda of meetings befitting a foreign dignitary, Mr. Romney will have an audience with Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, as well as Mr. Netanyahu. The meeting with the latter, meanwhile, will include Israel's security cabinet, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Defense Minister Ehud Barak.

Associated Press                                                                                                             Against the backdrop of Jerusalem's Old City walls, Mr. Romney will deliver a speech Sunday focusing on the common values the U.S. and Israel share as well as the threats the Middle Eastern country faces. He will round out his visit with a Monday morning fundraiser.     "As always, [he's] showing his support in a very public way for Israel's leaders," said Dan Senor, a foreign-policy adviser to the Romney campaign. "America is not ashamed by the lack of distance that exists between America and its allies."     Highlighting the challenge Mr. Romney will face in striking the right tone, the former Massachusetts governor demurred in an interview with the Haaretz newspaper from answering questions about how he would confront Iran and handle Israel's expanding settlements in Palestinian territory—issues that have complicated ties between the Obama and Netanyahu governments.      Mr. Romney also ignored a chance to repeat his oft-cited quip during the Republican primary campaign that Mr. Obama had thrown Israel "under the bus."

But he took an implicit dig at the Obama administration—which has been involved in open spats with the Netanyahu government—by saying that policy differences between the allies are "best in keeping to ourselves, in private."     One of Mr. Romney's fiercest criticisms of the current administration is that it has done too little to temper the threat that Iran might develop nuclear weapons. But Mr. Obama has tightened sanctions on Tehran and, like Mr. Romney, has said military intervention could be an option, leaving less daylight between the policy prescriptions the candidates have put forward.     Mr. Romney's lack of foreign-policy experience leaves him a relative unknown to the Israeli public. Even so, the public here is keenly aware of Mr. Obama's difficulties with Mr. Netanyahu.     "Every time that Obama had an issue with Netanyahu's policies, Netanyahu succeeded in turning this into, 'Obama is critical of Israel,' " said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. Mr. Netanyahu "created an impression…that Obama is not pro-Israel enough."     —Carol Lee contributed to this article.
