Representative Jim McGovern, a senior Democrat, said late Monday that leadership was still trying to work out whether they had the votes to proceed.Democrats hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House and Republicans have said they will not support the budget plan.Liberals worry they might lose leverage on the social-spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill.The delay does not necessarily mean that Biden's budget plan is doomed. Pelosi can bring it up again for a vote, presumably after working out a compromise between the party's factions.Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, said the chamber will return at noon (1600 GMT) Tuesday. It was not clear whether Democrats would have resolved their divisions by that point.The setback comes as Biden is facing sharp criticism over the Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan after 20 years of war. read more The House vote would allow Democrats to pass the social-spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Susan Cornwell and David Morgan; Editing by Andy Sullivan, Peter Cooney and Richard PullinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
