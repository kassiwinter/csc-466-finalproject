He has used phrases that suggest he is being "instructed" on which reporters to call on from a pre-selected list. On several occasions, he has said he is "going to get in trouble" if he answers questions from reporters.The White House has also apparently cut the feed from several Biden events, most recently during a Sept. 13 briefing on wildfires with federal and state officials in Boise, Idaho.
