WASHINGTON—Republicans said they plan to put off any new health-care overhaul plan until after the 2020 election, hoping to avoid a replay of last fall’s bruising campaign and setting up a clear contrast with Democrats looking to expand the government’s role in insurance coverage.President Trump flagged the shift in a series of late-night tweets in which he continued to attack the Affordable Care Act but said any changes to it would have to wait for a Republican majority in both chambers of Congress. Heading into the campaign season, the GOP is now on track to pursue targeted measures aimed at lowering drug prices and out-of-pocket costs, as well as attacking such ideas as Medicare for All. Democrats are focused on driving down costs and defending the ACA against GOP-led legal attacks, with some in the party floating broader health-care proposals such as a government-run health system.

He also warned against expanded government coverage that could potentially replace private insurance. “I see what the Democrats are doing, what they’re planning. It’s a disaster.”          Speaking to supporters at a dinner Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump said opposition to the Democrats’ push is “a great thing for us to run on.”      Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) countered: “They have no health-care plan. It’s the same old song they’ve been singing: They’re for repeal, they have no replace.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      The GOP lost the House to Democrats in 2018 in part over voters’ concerns about health insurance and the fate of the ACA, which covers about 20 million Americans through its insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. No GOP replacement plan exists, and Republican lawmakers had rebuffed Mr. Trump’s recent efforts to spur on a new push.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he told Mr. Trump in a phone call Monday afternoon that the Senate GOP wouldn’t be revisiting the party’s failed 2017 efforts to repeal and replace the ACA.     “I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,” Mr. McConnell told reporters, noting that didn’t rule out more narrowly focused bills from GOP senators.      The Trump administration thrust health care back into the spotlight last week when it asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the ACA. The move sowed confusion over the next steps if the law is thrown out, though administration officials say no one would immediately lose coverage.     White House press secretary         Sarah Sanders    said Tuesday on Fox News that the administration would “lay out principles” of a health plan, but she didn’t provide a timeline.     Democrats said the administration’s decision to side with the lawsuit seeking to overturn former President Obama’s health law proves Mr. Trump and Republicans pose a threat to health coverage for millions of people. GOP bills in Congress in 2017 would have resulted in roughly 20 million more people uninsured by 2026.                                                 Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) spoke at an event announcing legislation to lower health-care costs last week in Washington.                  Photo:            J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press                                                                                                             Democratic presidential candidate         Beto O’Rourke    talked up the need for “guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care,” at a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday. The former Texas congressman said coverage should prioritize “affordability and prescription medications, that ensures that we bring down the cost of our premiums and our deductibles.”      Democratic presidential hopefuls are offering proposals that range from letting more people buy into Medicare to a switch to full government-run health care, or Medicare for All. These ideas appeal to the party’s progressive base, but they risk alienating voters who see the moves as too radical, and candidates remain divided over how far to go.     Sens. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and Tim Kaine (D., Va.) on Tuesday reintroduced legislation to create Medicare-X, a public plan that would offer families, individuals and small businesses additional, low-cost health insurance choices on the ACA marketplace.     Mr. Trump’s announcement last week that the GOP would produce a health-care plan took Republicans by surprise. Although some GOP senators began discussions over various health-care bills, they didn’t expect to reach a consensus or vote on any major health-care overhaul before the 2020 election, according to lawmakers and aides.     Republicans were relieved to see Mr. Trump’s shift in tone this week, which some GOP aides described as a punt.     “All the Republican leaders told [Mr. Trump] it’s the wrong time for them to have a health care debate, it allows Democrats to say the election is about dropping 22 million people without any alternative,” said Robert Blendon, a health policy professor at Harvard University. He added that they said “this is not the time to revisit the ACA when they want to run against Medicare for All.”     GOP lawmakers said Mr. Trump’s pivot would make it easier for them to focus on other issues, including the economy and national security, that they believe will help them more with voters.     The Trump administration is already pursuing some efforts to lower health costs, including possibly requiring hospitals and doctors to disclose their negotiated rates with insurers. Officials say this will spur competition and enable consumers to price shop. They also required hospitals this year to start posting list prices and are looking at ways to lower drug prices by curbing the rebates drug makers pay to middlemen who manage pharmacy plans.      Some Republican lawmakers have backed a longtime Democratic goal to import drugs from Canada. Senate Finance Committee Chairman         Chuck Grassley    (R., Iowa) has also backed limits on anticompetitive behavior from drug makers. Both parties are also focused on ending surprise medical bills for unexpected out-of-network coverage.     Sixty-nine percent of Americans said reducing health-care costs should be a top priority for the president and Congress, according to a recent Pew survey. The number has risen steadily from 61% who cited the concern eight years ago.     According to administration officials, internal White House discussions over health care have been contentious at times and Mr. Trump was encouraged to take on the issue, which he promised as a candidate to address, by his acting chief of staff         Mick Mulvaney.         Mr. Trump has said preserving coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions would be critical, people familiar with his thinking say. Ideas have included turning ACA funding into block grants that states could use to set up their own health systems and preserving some sort of subsidies to assist lower-income people with obtaining coverage.      Democrats in the House and Senate on Tuesday introduced resolutions condemning the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the ACA. The House is expected to vote on the resolution Wednesday, a move designed to force Republicans to go on the record over whether they support efforts to unwind the health-care law. Some House Republicans are expected to vote with Democrats.     The lawsuit seeking to invalidate the ACA is currently pending before the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The case was brought by Republican-led states. An eventual Fifth Circuit ruling will likely take several months, and if the case goes to the Supreme Court, the litigation could last well into 2020.     —Alex Leary contributed to this article.
