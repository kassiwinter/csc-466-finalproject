    Sen. Cory Booker’s desperate attempts to win the love of the Democratic base hit a new low Thursday, with an utterly pathetic fit of oh-so-dramatic . . . fakery.
He kicked off the hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by announcing he was releasing “committee confidential” documents, then bragged, “I’m knowingly violating the rules.”
Doing his job, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley warned such a move could get him tossed from the Senate. Booker dared him to “bring the charges.”
Other Dems joined in. Sen. Mazie Hirono also released documents, boasting that she’d “defy anyone.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal reserved the right to divulge any documents he and his colleagues deem “appropriate.”
But for all the posturing, the info was a dud. The document supposedly proving Kavanaugh is a racist who backs racial profiling actually showed him seeking “race-neutral” policies. Another document leaked earlier that allegedly proves he’d toss Roe v. Wade merely had him warning (in 2003) that not all legal scholars saw that ruling as “settled law.”
And get this: All the documents had been cleared for release before Booker’s charade — and he reportedly knew it.
Whatever Democratic voters are looking for in a 2020 nominee, we’re pretty sure it involves genuine principles and a real willingness to take risks — or, at the very least, much better acting ability.
