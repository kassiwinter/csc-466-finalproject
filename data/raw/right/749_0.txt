                                                        This handout photo released by the US Navy shows Captain Brett Crozier addressing the crew for the first time as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) during a change of command ceremony on the ships flight deck in San Diego, California on November 1, 2019.

So a word about Thursday’s firing of a Navy officer who showed up in the news asking for help containing a coronavirus outbreak on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt.          Many have been quick to lionize         Capt. Brett Crozier    as a hero who spoke up in defense of his crew. His March 30 four-page letter, which leaked to the press this week, said he urgently needed to offload some 4,000 deployed sailors to quarantine in Guam to arrest the virus. It is bracing reading. “If we do not act now,” Capt. Crozier wrote, “we are failing to take care of our most trusted asset—our Sailors.” It isn’t clear who leaked the letter.      Acting Navy Secretary         Thomas Modly    said Thursday that he’d relieved Capt. Crozier for showing “extremely poor judgment.” Mr. Modly said the captain sent his letter to 20 or 30 people over an unclassified channel and was operating outside normal procedures in the chain of command. These are serious, fireable offenses, and Capt. Crozier could have offered his resignation instead if he felt he’d exhausted his ability to care properly for his sailors.      More substantively, adversaries are now aware that a U.S. aircraft carrier is said to be in rough shape in the South Pacific. China and Russia would be delighted to exploit American weakness amid a pandemic. Capt. Crozier’s letter said the U.S. is not at war but that doesn’t mean it isn’t under threat.               Then again, there are questions. What would motivate a captain with more than 25 years in the Navy to torch his own career? Anyone who reaches such a prestigious position in the Navy tends to be a company man. Mr. Modly says that none of the more than 100 people on the ship who have tested positive have been hospitalized, and that his office had already been working with Capt. Crozier.      But it is tough to square the divergent stories between the Navy Secretary in Washington and the captain leading a warship. Mr. Modly in his Thursday press conference said this firing doesn’t mean local commanders shouldn’t speak up about problems, though many will doubtless conclude otherwise from this episode.      Videos have surfaced on the internet appearing to show the Roosevelt’s sailors cheering Capt. Crozier as he departs the ship. Most of the rank-and-file seem to see Capt. Crozier as defending their interests at great personal cost. Navy brass should take this as an indication of dysfunction in the chain of command, which starts at the top. Why do so many sailors and veterans find it plausible that Capt. Crozier was getting the brush off from his bosses?                                         Wonder Land: While Republicans warn against a permanent government expansion, Democrats including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see this as a big progressive moment.
