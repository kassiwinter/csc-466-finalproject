Congressional leaders say they have a deal to fund border security and avoid another government shutdown. Both sides are claiming victory, but there are still hurdles to overcome.
The agreement first has to pass the House and Senate. President Donald Trump acknowledged the breakthrough in negotiations at his rally for border security in El Paso last night, but gave no clear signal he'll support it.
"As I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is still being made with this committee," the president said. "Just so you know we're building the wall anyway. They say that progress is being made." Negotiators reached a deal "in principle" late Monday night, emerging from a closed door meeting with the news. They agree it's not perfect and not everyone will be happy.
"Not a single one of us is going to get every single thing we want. But nobody does," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).
It only includes about $1.4 billion for border barriers and not the $5.7 billion that Trump wanted.
But the Democrats did back down from their demand to limit the number of detentions by ICE.
The president shot down that attempt to decrease detentions at his rally.
"If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country," he said.
A potential rival for the president in 2020, El Paso native, Beto O'Rourke, also held a rally in El Paso, challenging the president's border wall.
"The US cities of the US-Mexico border are far safer than the US cities that are deeper in the interior of the United States of America," he said.
Some conservative lawmakers are already criticizing the deal. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) tweeted, "While the president was giving a great speech, Congress was putting together a bad deal on immigration." Now, it remains to be seen if the president agrees.
