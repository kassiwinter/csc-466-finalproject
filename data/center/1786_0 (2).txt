WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    took swipes at the field of candidates looking to succeed him in the White House, and joked about Congress,      Joe Biden,        Dick Cheney,      Donald Trump,        journalists and himself in his remarks at the White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday.Mr. Obama, enjoying a degree of freedom that comes with being near the end of a second term, was particularly animated when discussing climate change. Playing off a Comedy Central sketch, Mr. Obama tapped his “anger translator” to deride Sen. Jim Inhofe’s (R., Okla.) use of a snowball on the Senate floor in February to question climate change. “Instead of doing anything about it, we’ve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate,” Mr. Obama said, usurping his anger translator’s comedic rage. “It is crazy. What about our kids? What kind of stupid, shortsighted irresponsible…”                                         Keegan-Michael Key showed up at the White House Correspondents' Dinner to do a version of the "Key and Peele" skit "Obama's Anger Translator Luther" with the President himself.                                                                                                     “Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,” Keegan-Michael Key interjected. Mr. Key had been rephrasing the president’s low-key comments into a furious commentary but was outdone during that particular moment of Mr. Obama’s stand-up routine.               The president also referenced his recent actions on immigration, efforts to thaw relations with Cuba, negotiate with Iran and other initiatives widely derided by Republicans.     “After the midterm elections, my advisers asked me, Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?” Mr. Obama said to laughs. “I said, well I have something that rhymes with bucket list. Take executive action on immigration? Bucket.”                                         President Obama jokes about his "bucket list" at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.                                                                                                     And in a reference to graying hair and a recent invitation by House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) to Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    to speak before Congress, Mr. Obama joked: “I look so old, John Boehner has already invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral.”     On the economy and Hillary Clinton’s presidential aspirations: “For many Americans, this is a time of deep uncertainty. For example, I have one friend, just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year. And she is now living out of a van in Iowa.”     Mr. Obama also joked about potential GOP candidates in 2016. On former Sen.         Rick Santorum    of Pennsylvania, he said: “Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or loved one, to which gays and lesbians across the country responded, that’s not going to be a problem.”        
More                                             "Saturday Night Live" comedian Cecily Strong on the Secret Service, the Washington Hilton, and print journalists at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner.                                                                                                                                          President Barack Obama takes a jab at the Koch brothers at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.                                                                                                     About 2,700 guests in black ties and evening gowns packed into the Washington Hilton ballroom for the event with journalists, politicos, small-screen celebrities and comedic headliner Cecily Strong of Saturday Night Live.     Ms. Strong didn’t receive the same yuks as the president, in part because—having to follow the president—she trod on some of the same comedic ground, including jokes about Vice President Biden’s shoulder rubs.     In one bit, she referred to the Secret Service, responsible for protecting the president and his family, as the only law enforcement agency that would get in trouble if a black man were to get shot.     In a similar vein, she quipped: “Your hair is so white now it can talk back to the police.”     Ms. Strong also drew a forced smile from Mr. Obama when she noted gains by the terrorist group that calls itself Islamic State, also known as ISIS. “If anyone is guilty of taking ISIS too lightly it’s, um, you know,” she said, giving an exaggerated nod toward Mr. Obama.     She poked fun as presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas). She said it is like the Republicans are trying to pick someone who is the opposite of President Obama: “a Canadian Latino who will never be president.” Of Sen.         Rand Paul    (R., Ky.), she said, if he runs and loses, at least he can say “I ran’d.”     The White House Correspondents Association marked its 100th anniversary last year. The first spring dinner was in 1920 and has grown to include a series of events and parties throughout the weekend. Today, it is best known as an annual occasion when the president cracks jokes before a room of media moguls, journalists and their guests. Informally, reporters call it “nerd prom.”                                         At the 2015 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, President Obama jokes that he and Joe Biden are so close, some places in Indiana won't serve them pizza.                                                                                                                                          "Saturday Night Live" comedian Cecily Strong takes on politics and women's bodies, C-Span, and prostitutes and congressmen at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner.                                                                                                     Many reporters take sources to the dinner and organizations often invite celebrities to sit at their tables, and the event has been criticized for portraying reporters as too close to the powerful people they cover.     But the number of big-screen stars appears to be tailing off well into Mr. Obama’s second term. “With the exception of Bradley Cooper…the number of high-wattage film stars who used to be the evening’s big draw is continuing to dwindle,” the Hollywood Reporter said.     Among those spotted at the event: Oscar-winner Jane Fonda, real estate mogul Donald Trump, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, Orange is the New Black actress Laverne Cox, Modern Family’s Julie Bowen, actress Tea Leoni and model Adriana Lima. The number of attendees in the “famous for Washington” category was abundant.     While the red carpet and celebrity-spotting capture much of the evening’s attention, the dinner raises money for scholarships and recognizes some of the year’s best journalism.     “The first and most important mission of the White House Correspondents’ Association is to promote journalism education,” according to the group’s website. Money raised at this dinner will help fund 16 scholarships as well as programs in local Washington, D.C., high schools.     This year, the association awarded prizes recognizing the work of Peter Baker of the New York Times, Josh Lederman of the Associated Press, Jim Avila of ABC News, Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post, and Gary Fields, John R. Emshwiller, Rob Barry and Coulter Jones of The Wall Street Journal.     Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
