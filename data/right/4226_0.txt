      	New York City and state are joining up with a coalition of more than 20 state and local governments in a lawsuit to block a new rule issued by the federal government that opponents say would allow health care providers to deny treatment based on their personal views.
The suit, filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, alleges that a new rule by the US Department of Health and Human Services would allow individuals and businesses to refuse health-care services based on religious beliefs and “moral convictions” — which the plaintiffs say would disproportionately affect patients seeking procedures such as abortions and assisted suicides.
Entities that don’t follow the rule could cut off from federal health-care funding, according to a news release from Mayor de Blasio’s office.
The rule also allows employers to deny insurance coverage for procedures that they find objectionable.
City officials say the rule will fall particularly hard on members of the LGBT community, who already face discrimination in receiving health care.
“No federal law will stop us from treating people in need, especially transgender patients and New Yorkers seeking access to birth control or abortions,” said Mitchell Katz, president and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals, in a news release. “The refusal of care regulation is a refusal to care, and that’s not how New York City treats New Yorkers.”
HHS did not respond to a request for comment.
