Mr. Obama agreed to attend the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit meeting to be hosted by the government of Kenya in July, the first time the six-year-old forum will be held in sub-Saharan Africa.                       “His trip will build on the success of the August 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and continue our efforts to work with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, to accelerate economic growth,                         strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security,” the White House said in a statement.                       Mr. Obama has traveled to sub-Saharan Africa three previous times during his presidency but never to Kenya, where his father’s family is from. Kenya’s own instability and the persistent focus on                         Mr. Obama’s own roots have made such a visit politically complicated in the past. But now in his seventh year in office, Mr. Obama evidently has decided that he will absorb the inevitable chatter                         from those who persist in the unfounded belief that he was born there.                       The White House disclosed no other stops that Mr. Obama may make on the trip. The last time Mr. Obama was in Kenya was in 2006, when he was a senator.
