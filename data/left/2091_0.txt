WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel Wednesday that the killers responsible for last week's California massacre were individually radicalized before they ever met online and discussed jihad more than two years before the deadly assault that left 14 dead and 21 wounded.Comey's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee offers the fullest timeline yet for the radicalization of Sayed Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik and appears to undercut an earlier theory that the Pakistani-born Malik may have converted her husband to an extremist ideology, leading to the assault. Comey said Malik appears to have discussed jihad and martyrdom before she was granted a so-called fiancée visa in 2014 to enter the USA, where she later married Farook.Those early communications, Comey said, indicate the shooters were "at least in part'' inspired by the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Because the earliest discussions of jihad in 2013 appeared to come before the Islamic State's emergence as a global threat, Comey said investigators were reviewing other sources of similar radical thought that may have inspired the couple.Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whether the marriage of the two with similar extremist interests may have been arranged to allow the couple to develop an attack in the USA, Comey said investigators do not know."It would be a very important thing to know,'' he said.He said there was no reason to believe that "cells'' of operatives linked to the Islamic State were embedded in the USA, planning to strike. Largely based on the arsenal of ammunition and bomb components found in a search of the couple's Redlands, Calif., home, Comey said authorities continued to try to determine whether they had identified other possible targets.The FBI director said the San Bernardino assaults represented another "dimension'' of the terrorist threat, one distinct from last month's attack in Paris, which left 130 dead. In that case, teams of heavily armed killers attacked a series of targets, including a sports stadium and a crowded concert hall where most of the fatalities were inflicted. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks.He described the San Bernardino killers as violent extremists who prepared themselves below the radar of local and federal authorities while pursuing seemingly normal lives, only to strike out on their own.Investigators continued to question a Riverside, Calif., man and former neighbor of Farook who purchased the two semiautomatic rifles used in the attack, a federal law enforcement official said. The former neighbor, Enrique Marquez, provided authorities information to establish a firmer history of Farook's embrace of radical beliefs and the gunman's apparent interest in striking an undisclosed target years earlier, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly on the developing investigation."Finding these (suspects before their plots are carried out) is a very, very hard thing,'' Comey said.In October, Comey said the FBI had about 900 active investigations involving Islamic State sympathizers or other violent extremists across the USA. He said Wednesday that those inquiries remained open in every FBI field division in the country.Comey: Feds have roughly 900 domestic probes about Islamic State operatives, other extremistsThe new timeline for the San Bernardino couple's radicalization immediately prompted questions from lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked the director why Malik's references to jihad and martyrdom were not detected by authorities or explored as part of a vetting process before she was granted the U.S. visa.Though he declined to comment directly on that part of the investigation, Comey suggested the couple's communications were private and not accessible on public forums that could be monitored by authorities.Feds examining bank deposit linked to San Bernardino shooterIn Wednesday's wide-ranging Senate hearing, Graham, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, sought to draw Comey into the heated debate over GOP front-runner Donald Trump's call for banning Muslims from entering the USA. Graham asked whether the remarks represented a possible national security threat.Comey said that although he would not wade into the political discussion, he said "estrangement gets in the way" of protecting the nation.Follow @bykevinj on Twitter
