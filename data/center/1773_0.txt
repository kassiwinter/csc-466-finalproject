MANCHESTER, N.H.—Gov.         Chris Christie    called for reduced Social Security benefits for retired seniors earning more than $80,000 and eliminating the benefit entirely for individuals making $200,000 and up in other income, along with raising the retirement age to 69 from 67.The changes would not apply to current retirees or those near retirement, but could help keep Social Security sustainable for future generations, Mr. Christie said. Not acting would jeopardize longevity of Social Security and other entitlement programs, he said, and potentially lead to massive tax increases to prop them up.

Mr. Christie’s decision to take on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and disability insurance stands as perhaps the most significant policy proposal to date in the 2016 race, and one that will likely result in attacks from Democrats and his potential Republican competitors.         More        While national Republicans have often highlighted the need to scale back on health care entitlements, Social Security has presented more of a political third rail.               Mr. Christie alluded to the potential controversy that his proposal would trigger, but said that failing to address unsustainable entitlement programs shows a lack of leadership. He painted himself as someone who could take on that difficult fight.      “I know some in both political parties will criticize these ideas,” Mr. Christie said during the speech at New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. “These are the truths you all know in your gut. I want to give voice to those common sense truths that we already know.”          Mr. Christie’s proposal would reshape Social Security from its New Deal origins as retirement vehicle for most working Americans into a program that taxes workers at all income levels but pays benefits only to those without other major sources of retirement income.     “What Christie is doing is huge,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates debt reduction. “This is certainly farther than anyone has gone about being specific about hard choices.”     So far, many of the potential and announced Republican presidential hopefuls have focused on overhauling the tax code and balancing budgets, but Ms. MacGuineas said those proposals have largely avoided the specific trade-offs involved.     In that sense, Mr. Christie “is playing a leadership role that will force other people to say how they would fix it if they don’t like his approach,” she said.                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Christie’s speech comes at a moment when the fiscal austerity impulse in Washington has diminished. House lawmakers overwhelmingly passed legislation last month to fix the way Medicare pays doctors, ending the need for a series of short-term patches that became an annual rite in Washington. But about two-thirds of the measure’s $214 billion cost over the next decade would be financed through higher deficits.     Recent Republican budgets haven’t proposed major changes to Social Security and have instead focused on overhauling Medicare, which federal trustees last year said was on pace to exhaust its reserves in 2030.      Current estimates show that the Social Security program will be unable to make full benefit payments by 2034, which means at some point before then lawmakers could be forced to contemplate raising Social Security taxes or reducing benefit payments.     Mr. Christie’s proposal in many ways would go beyond the most detailed overhaul that Rep.         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) proposed, in 2010. He advocated allowing workers 54 years old and younger to shift a portion of Social Security payroll tax payments into private retirement-savings accounts. The proposal would also have very gradually increased the retirement age, which is already on pace to reach 67 years in 2026, to 70.     House Republicans’ subsequent budgets didn’t include the detailed overhaul proposal and instead carved out a more passive role for Congress. They would create a process by which the Social Security Board of Trustees and the president would submit to Congress a plan for restoring solvency to the entitlement program.     Republicans have also called for using a different calculation of Social Security cost-of-living increases that would slow the growth of benefit payments. Mr. Obama included the chained consumer-price index proposal in his 2013 budget but hasn’t since then.     Terry Holt, a Republican strategist who worked on George W. Bush’s 2004 presidential campaign, said there were political risks and benefits to Mr. Christie for stepping out on the issue.     “More and more pre-retirement Americans think Social Security is a dream that won’t come true, unless common sense changes can be made,” said Mr. Holt. He added: “His proposals make sense and he gets credit for not being afraid to tackle a tough issue.”     He said it could help Mr. Christie break out from the crowded field of GOP candidates. “He has to distinguish himself from the rest of the field and tackling a tough issue helps to do that,” said Mr. Holt.     The issue carries even more risk for Republicans now than it did when Mr. Bush was promoting his own controversial plan to partially privatize Social Security: The GOP has increasingly relied on votes from older Americans -- especially in congressional races.      In the 2014 midterm election GOP candidates won voters aged 65 and older by 16 percentage points, 57% to 41%, exit polls showed. Meanwhile, they lost voters aged 18 to 29 by 11 percentage points, 54% to 43%.     Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection in 2016, said he was opposed to the Christie proposal.     “I’m not for that,” said Mr. Kirk. “To get any changes to Social Security, you need bipartisan cooperation. I don’t think we could get that.”     David Winston, a Republican pollster, said that the focus on entitlement reform is a little beside the main point that is top of mind for most voters: The concern that while the economy is improving, their own situation is stagnant or declining.     “Ultimately the electorate is asking a much bigger question than how do you fix entitlements,” said Mr. Winston. “What they are looking for is for candidates to address the broader question of the economy. They feel like there is no way to financially make progress and that they are just treading water.”     Mr. Christie’s proposal to curb benefits to restore solvency comes as Democrats rush headlong in a different direction. Several Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is weighing a presidential run, have called for expanding Social Security benefits, embracing a longtime priority of progressives that until recently had gained little traction with party leaders.      Currently, the amount of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax each year is capped at $118,500. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who aligns with Democrats, has proposed applying the payroll tax to income above $250,000, which he said would extend the program past 2060.     The cost of mandatory federal spending – programs that include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--is set to swell amid the retirements of the Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964. Spending on Social Security will rise to 5.7% of gross domestic product by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office, from 4.2% in 1990. Defense spending, meanwhile, is set to fall to 2.6% of GDP from 5.1% over that span.     Mr. Christie has attracted some criticism among Republicans for expanding Medicaid in New Jersey, as part of the Affordable Care Act. The expansion has been fought by many conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the wealthy Koch brothers. Mr. Christie said the decision made sense for New Jersey, and officials say about 400,000 new people have enrolled since the expansion. The state’s budget has also benefited from the infusion of federal funds.     The Alliance for Retired Americans, a labor-backed group, denounced Mr. Christie for what they said was an attack of senior citizens “to further his own presidential ambitions.”     “Raising the Social Security age to 69, means-testing it, and eliminating benefits for some is a way to get one’s toe under the tent in order to destroy Social Security piece-by-piece,” said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the alliance. “If the 2016 Republican presidential primary campaign becomes a contest of who can make the most cuts on seniors’ backs, Republicans will need to adjust their message in a major way.”     Mr. Christie delivered his speech before about 120 people and took no questions after. He never referred to himself as a candidate, but alluded to language commonly used to analyze presidential candidacies in saying that he will never pander or “flip-flop.”      During his speech, Mr. Christie unveiled a 12-point plan to overhaul benefits for entitlement programs for retirees and the poor. He called for a gradual increase in the age when seniors qualify for Medicare to 67 years old by 2040, from its current average of 65. Seniors who could afford to pay more into the health care benefit would also be asked to do so.     Mr. Christie also proposed a plan to transfer Medicaid management and funding over to the states, a retooling of the health care program for the poor that was championed by Mr. Ryan.     Mr. Christie’s cuts to retirement benefits--potentially the most controversial parts of his plan--would apply a means test only to non-social security income. It would impact less than 2% of all of Mr. Christie’s recipients. Kenneth Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and one of Mr. Christie’s biggest financial backers if he runs for president, has said he supports reducing Social Security benefits for seniors who don’t need the allowance.     Mr. Christie has accepted Medicaid funding offered under the Affordable Healthcare Act, but also criticized President Barak Obama’s signature healthcare program as being “jammed down our throats.” Mr. Christie said while he’d prefer a more market-oriented healthcare option, entitlements must be addressed now instead of just letting court challenges play out.      “The growth of the entitlement beast continues unabated while all this talking is going on,” Mr. Christie said.      Some attendees were convinced by Tuesday’s speech. “I was really impressed by the specifics,” said Andrew Hardister, a Concord software sales manager who attended the speech. “I don’t think anything needs to stay the same as it was in the 1930s.”      “I liked his message,” said Steve Grafton, a self-employed resident of Chichester, N.H., who attended the speech. “These are timely issues that need to be brought up.”     -- Janet Hook and Josh Dawsey contributed to this article     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
