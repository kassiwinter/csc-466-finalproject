ROSWELL, Ga.—A week before the midterm elections, the contest remains focused where it began 18 months ago—in America’s suburbs that are home to swaths of educated and wealthy voters who will determine which party controls the House of Representatives. Here in an area north of Atlanta, GOP Rep. Karen Handel is vying to retain the House seat she won in a special election last year, which, at $60 million, was the most expensive House race ever. Both her campaign and that of Democratic challenger Lucy McBath—along with scores across the country—are drawing from the experience of that June 2017 election, which presaged this year’s fierce fight for control of the House and the 2018 Democratic fundraising avalanche when         Jon Ossoff,    a previously unknown candidate with a thin résumé, raised $31 million.     Ms. Handel, as she and GOP allies did with Mr. Ossoff, is trying to tether her challenger to House Democratic Leader      Nancy Pelosi        —a Republican bête noire—in speeches and TV ads. The incumbent also is reviving from last year accusations that her opponent lacks deep ties to the district.     At the same time, after campaigning in the special election with President Trump with funding from House Speaker Paul Ryan’s super PAC, Ms. Handel is now pitching herself as an independent voice focused on local issues, a shift that has accompanied falling approval ratings for Mr. Trump in the district. The biggest applause line her stump speech at a Sunday campaign rally at a guitar store here came when she touted a $184 million federal grant to build express lanes on a local highway.               “I am not an extension of the White House,” Ms. Handel said in an interview in the store, where electric guitars hanging on the wall listed for up to $11,000. “I am not even an extension of the House Republican leadership.”     Ms. McBath, a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant, became a gun-control activist after her son was murdered in 2012 and was a surrogate for         Hillary Clinton’s    2016 campaign. While Ms. McBath has benefited from the volunteer network built for Mr. Ossoff, she has made more explicit policy appeals to women than he did, particularly aimed at voters who have long backed Republicans.                                         The 2018 midterm elections are here, and wealthy donors are spending millions on U.S. politics. How are they able to give so much?

Her TV ads tell her story of surviving breast cancer twice. She criticizes Ms. Handel for opposing abortion rights and for backing the GOP health care bill that “would cut coverage for people like me, with pre-existing conditions.”     Ms. Handel’s seat, which Republicans have held since         Newt Gingrich    first won it in 1978, is home to the largest concentration of college-educated women—30% of the district’s population, according to Census data—of any congressional district represented by a Republican. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 70% of college-educated women disapprove of Mr. Trump, versus 27% who approve of him. The poll also found women with college degrees are the most likely demographic to vote in the midterm elections.     Of the 40 districts with the most college-educated women, Republicans hold 11—and 10 of those are rated competitive by the Cook Political Report. Polling shows Ms. Handel’s race against Ms. McBath within the margin of error.     “Demographics all across the country are changing,” said         Tom Price,    Mr. Trump’s former Health and Human Services secretary who held the seat before Ms. Handel. “You get folks coming from all over who are moving to Atlanta.”                                                 Rep. Karen Handel spoke with a supporter at Righteous Guitars in Roswell, Ga.

Ms. Handel’s ads dub Ms. McBath an “out-of-towner.”     Ms. McBath, who first moved to Georgia in 1990 and to the district in 2008, said she changed her voting address to Tennessee for the 2016 election because her husband moved there to handle family obligations. She changed her address back to the district in 2017. “I have been here,” she said.          At the McBath house party, Cherish Burnham wore eight buttons, each for a different female candidate on the ballot in the Atlanta suburbs. A 44-year-old who left a job at CNN to have triplet boys nine years ago, Ms. Burnham said she got involved in politics for the first time to help Mr. Ossoff’s campaign in order to push back against the Trump administration.     “Now we are better organized,” Ms. Burnham said. “We had our teams ready because of Jon Ossoff.”     Ms. Handel is aiming to keep support from women like Cynthia Reichard, an owner of a perfume and fragrance manufacturer in Marietta. Ms. Reichard said her firm has suffered “millions of dollars” of extra costs because of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs and that she disagrees with the GOP platform on social issues, yet she is backing Ms. Handel because of her focus on cutting taxes.     “I’m socially liberal and fiscally conservative, and fiscally conservative leads the way,” Ms. Reichard said.     —Follow regular updates and insights from the campaign trail at WSJ.com/CampaignWire     Write to Reid J.
