WASHINGTON—A federal judge ruled Wednesday that former Trump campaign chairman         Paul Manafort    lied to investigators about his contact with an associate the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence despite agreeing to a plea deal requiring him to tell the truth.U.S. District Judge         Amy Berman Jackson    said in a four-page order that the government met its burden of proof in showing that Mr. Manafort intentionally misled investigators on at least three matters. Her ruling voids the government’s obligations under the agreement to offer him leniency in exchange for his cooperation in special counsel         Robert Mueller’s    investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The ruling—which also said the government didn’t persuade the court that Mr. Manafort lied on two other issues—is another blow to the long-time political consultant who earned tens of millions of dollars advising politicians in Ukraine. It means that Mr. Manafort, who is already facing eight or more years in prison, potentially faces a longer punishment when he is sentenced next month.     In particular, the judge ruled that Mr. Manafort lied about his communications with         Konstantin Kilimnik,    as well as payments to a law firm, and that he made false statements relevant to another, unspecified Justice Department investigation. Mr. Kilimnik, who remains at large but is believed to be in Russia, worked with Mr. Manafort for years on his Ukraine work and oversaw the Kiev office of Mr. Manafort’s consulting firm.                At a sealed hearing last week, a prosecutor in Mr. Mueller’s office described Mr. Manafort’s contacts with Mr. Kilimnik as at “the heart” of what the special counsel is investigating, noting the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s assessment that Mr. Kilimnik had a “relationship with Russian intelligence.” Mr. Mueller’s office previously charged Mr. Kilimnik with helping Mr. Manafort try to influence potential witnesses in the investigation.      It wasn’t clear whether the full investigation into communications between Messrs. Kilimnik and Manafort could move forward without Mr. Manafort’s cooperation.     The decision does mean that Mr. Manafort won’t receive any credit for his cooperation with prosecutors.      Mr. Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud in a Virginia trial last year and pleaded guilty in Washington soon after to additional, related charges.     In her Wednesday order, Judge Berman Jackson also ruled the government had failed to prove that Mr. Manafort lied about Mr. Kilimnik’s role in any potential conspiracy to obstruct justice. She also ruled that the government didn’t prove that Mr. Manafort lied about his contacts with the Trump administration.                                                 Mr. Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was found to have lied about his contacts with a Russian figure linked to Kremlin intelligence.

In a closed-door hearing last week, Judge Berman Jackson had questions for prosecutors over their allegations.     “I’m not sure that is something that a prosecutor would prosecute as a criminal false statement necessarily,” Judge Berman Jackson said at that hearing, referring to one of the allegations, according to heavily redacted transcripts.      Prosecutor         Andrew Weissmann    told the judge that several of Mr. Manafort’s alleged lies involved issues core to the special prosecutor’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any links to the Trump campaign. He also said Mr. Manafort had motives to mislead investigators and deliberately conceal information.     Mr. Manafort was one of the few targets of Mr. Mueller’s investigation to fight charges in court, but that effort has been largely unsuccessful.      Just two months after he reached his September plea agreement, prosecutors accused Mr. Manafort of breaching his plea deal and said he had lied many times over the course of his dozen sessions with investigators and before the grand jury.     Mr. Manafort’s attorneys have denied that he intentionally lied to prosecutors. Instead they have blamed his alleged misstatements on a faulty memory and his lack of access to relevant documents and evidence before his multiple meetings with prosecutors.     The case against Mr. Manafort was related to his political consulting work in Ukraine for pro-Russian politicians that predated his work with the Trump campaign.     In responding to the allegations, Mr. Manafort’s attorneys also inadvertently disclosed last month that Mr. Manafort gave 2016 polling data to Mr. Kilimnik, and may have discussed a peace plan for Ukraine with him.     At the hearing, prosecutors also discussed a poll in Ukraine that Mr. Manafort assisted on and about which he allegedly misled investigators.     Mr. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced in Washington on March 13.     He was also awaiting a sentencing date in Virginia, where the judge postponed the hearing to see how the breach of the plea-deal issue was resolved.
