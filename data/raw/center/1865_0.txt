The rule was widely criticized by Democrats and those advocating for victims of sexual assault. Biden promised to quickly end the previous administration’s Title IX rule on the campaign trail. “The [Biden administration] policy that is very clear is that all students should be guaranteed an educational environment that is free from discrimination, including discrimination in the form of sexual harassment and including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity,” an administration official said.Biden is expected to speak at an event Monday afternoon alongside Harris and other senior officials.
