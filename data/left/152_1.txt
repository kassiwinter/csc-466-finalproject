Not even the guy who runs Twitter can keep his Twitter account safe from hackers, apparently.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's account was taken over on Friday, suddenly posting a series of racist and anti-Semitic messages, including one that was just the N-word in all caps. Another claimed there was a bomb at Twitter's headquarters.Believe it or not, this isn't even the first time this has happened. Engadget points out Dorsey also had his account taken over in 2016. This time, the group responsible seems to be the same one whose other recent targets have been people like YouTuber Shane Dawson, reports The Wrap. The tweets were apparently posted from the app Cloudhopper, and so Gizmodo notes Dorsey "may have connected his account to the Cloudhopper app and forgotten to revoke the privileges," which for the CEO of a major social media company is a pretty bad thing to forget.The tweets have already been deleted, and Twitter quickly released a statement saying it's "aware" that Dorsey's account was taken over and that it's "investigating what happened." Meanwhile, screenshots of the shocking, racist messages posted on the company CEO's verified account spread like wildfire. Brendan Morrow
