       Democrats and members of the media on Monday mocked ousted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci for being dismissed after just 10 days on the job.        Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted, "Thank you Anthony @Scaramucci for your service. I speak for a grateful nation when I say, â€˜has it really only been 11 days?!?'"                          Another Democratic representative from California, Ted Lieu, said, "Dear @Scaramucci: It's okay, you can delete these stories from the internet just like your tweets and no one will ever know," referencing the fact that Scaramucci deleted some of his tweets in which he expressed views that contradicted Trump's position after being named communications director.                          The New York Post tweeted a link to an article about Scaramucci's dismissal with an image that said "Survivor White House."                          "Before Mooch's official start date. So he was never really here. Poetic," tweeted Seth Mandel, the New York Post's opinion editor.                       Before Mooch's official start date. So he was never really here.

"Um guys," tweeted Cox Media Group's Dorey Scheimer, accompanied by a photo of Trump and Scaramucci reading, "How to lose a guy in 10 days."                          "In 10 days, Anthony Scaramucci: got a job had a baby ended his marriage lost a job," tweeted Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine.
