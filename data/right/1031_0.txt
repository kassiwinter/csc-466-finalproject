      The economy gained 4.8 million jobs in June, lowering the unemployment rate to 11.1%, the Labor Department said Thursday.       June's job gains were a record and easily beat forecasters' expectations. Nevertheless, the jobs report is clouded by the fact that, even with the improvements, the labor market was in historically bad shape even before coronavirus outbreaks worsened throughout the South and West later in June.             “Looking beyond the June employment data, worrisome signs have emerged in recent days regarding a pullback in store traffic and spending likely linked to the resurgence of COVID-19," said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. "While the economy is widely thought to be rebounding now that we’ve quietly slipped into the third quarter, the strength and sustainability of the rebound remain at risk."      Perhaps most troubling, Thursday's report showed a higher number, 2.8 million, of job losses described as permanent. In previous months of the pandemic, around 90% of job losses had been described as temporary, suggesting that the workers hoped to go back to their old jobs once the pandemic passed.       Two-fifths of June's job gains took place in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had been badly bruised by the pandemic. Those jobs, though, are the ones most in danger from rising cases of the coronavirus. Restaurants and bars in several states have had to curtail service in the past few weeks.      Employment in retail rose by 740,000 last month, after a gain of 372,000 in May and losses totaling 2.4 million in March and April combined. On net, employment in this sector is 1.3 million lower than in February.      While the unemployment rate has dropped for two consecutive months, the improvement is uneven among the races. The jobless rate in June for white workers was 10.1%, while the unemployment rates for Black or African American, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino workers were much higher: 15.4%, 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively.       The unemployment rate for teenagers between 16 and 19 years old was 23.2% in June. During the same month last years, the jobless rate was 15% for the category.       ADP on Wednesday reported that nearly 2.4 million private sector jobs were added in June. The data processing company also made a huge revision of 6 million in its estimate of private sector employment for May.       June’s jobs numbers come as Arizona recorded nearly 4,878 new cases and 88 new deaths Wednesday, a record single-day jump for the state. Texas health officials reported 57 new deaths Wednesday, the most since May 14, when the state set a record with 58 daily deaths. And in California, 107 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported Tuesday, the first time the daily death toll has surpassed 100 since June 10.      The data for Friday's report, though, was collected before the massive increase in infections in the second half of June. Subsequently, many businesses in the South and West shut down to avoid spreading the virus, and many restaurants and bars had greater restrictions imposed on them by state and local governments. Those closings are likely to raise unemployment next month.      Thursday’s Labor Department report follows the shocking news from last month that showed the economy gained 2.5 million jobs in May and lowered the unemployment rate to 13.3%. Forecasters had expected job losses of 8 million and an unemployment rate of about 20%.      In the face of soaring unemployment, Democrats, such as Rep. Jim Clyburn from South Carolina, are calling on the GOP-led Senate to extend the $600 unemployment bonus payment beyond its July 31 expiration date.      “Now is not the time to pull the rug out from our fragile economy,” Clyburn said on Wednesday. “Federal support like the $600 unemployment insurance benefit are propping up the economy and keeping millions of people out of poverty.”      The March CARES Act provided extra $600 weekly payments in addition to regular unemployment insurance. It is a flat payment that does not take into account former salary levels or whether the worker was part time or full time.       The House in May approved legislation that extended these payments to January 31, 2021. The Democratic legislation would also give $1 trillion in funding to states and cities to avoid layoffs. Thursday's report showed a loss of 25,000 state government jobs.       The Senate is not expected to take up the bill, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, has vowed to not extend the measure.       A large majority of recipients would earn more from benefits than from work if the $600-a-week pandemic unemployment benefit boost is extended past its July expiration, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.
