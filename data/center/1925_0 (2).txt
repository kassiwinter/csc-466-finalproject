Hillary Clinton is proposing a sharp increase in the capital-gains tax rate paid by the highest earners on short-term investments, in some cases nearly doubling it, her attempt to shift American companies’ focus to their long-term interests.The hope, Mrs. Clinton said Friday, is that giving taxpayers greater incentives to hold investments longer would reduce pressure on corporations to show near-term gains in their share price, so they could focus on making long-term investments and boost worker pay. “American business needs to break free from the tyranny of today’s earning report so they can do what they do best: innovate, invest and build tomorrow’s prosperity,” the Democratic presidential front-runner said in a speech in New York. “It’s time to start measuring value in terms of years—or the next decade—not just next quarter.”     Under the Clinton plan, the wealthiest Americans would see investment gains taxed on a sliding scale, with the levy dropping the longer the investment is held.

Her proposal offers a contrast to her Republican opponents, who have mostly suggested ways to cut taxes. In the case of capital-gains taxes, some are urging elimination of them, which they say amounts to double taxation on investors. Sen.         Marco Rubio    (R., Fla.) has a plan to reduce tax rates for individuals and corporations. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wants to scrap the current code and replace it with a flat tax. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would abolish the Internal Revenue Service.     Some experts are skeptical that Mrs. Clinton’s proposal would accomplish what she intends, saying it would distort investment decisions without making much of a difference in corporate behavior.     Andy Mattson, an accountant in Campbell, Calif., who advises high-net-worth investors in Silicon Valley, says the proposal is unlikely to affect his clients’ behavior, though it could raise taxes for some. “Most of them have investment advisers with a long-term philosophy,” he said.     Campaign advisers say Mrs. Clinton’s goal is chiefly to change investor behavior, not to address income inequality or to raise money for the federal Treasury. The campaign had no estimate on how much money her changes would generate.     The proposal calls for taxes on gains from investments held for less than two years to nearly double to the standard income-tax rate of 39.6%. The rate would gradually drop, reaching 20% for investments held at least six years. Under current law, the 20% rate is available for top earners if they hold investments for at least one year. These figures don’t count an extra 3.8% tax on net investment income for upper-income earners included as part of the health-care law.     The campaign’s proposal would affect only those in the top income-tax bracket, about 0.5% of taxpayers. In 2015, the top bracket takes effect above $464,850 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly and $411,500 for single filers.                                                                                                                                                     Supporters say the top earners are responsible for such a large portion of investment gains that the tax change would have an impact on corporate behavior.     Gene Sperling, an economist adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said the plan makes “common economic sense...If you can lower your tax rate in half by holding longer, of course it’s going to make people think more about long-term value creation.”     Mrs. Clinton would eliminate capital-gains taxes for certain long-term investments in small businesses or in communities hit with economic challenges.     Beyond the capital-gains changes, Mrs. Clinton called for a review of securities rules related to shareholder activists, who buy up stock in a company in order to press for changes. Some of these investors press for positive changes in management or for social responsibility, she said, but others are “hit-and-run” specialists who want a quick payout.     She also promised changes to the tax treatment of executive compensation to reduce incentives for corporate officials to temporarily raise the share price. She said companies should be required to explain how executive compensation promotes a company’s long-term health.     To improve conditions for workers and their pay, she vowed to fight for labor-organizing rights and encourage companies to invest in training. Mrs. Clinton also endorsed a proposed $15-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers in New York, citing the cost of living in a place like Manhattan.     —Laura Saunders contributed to this article.
