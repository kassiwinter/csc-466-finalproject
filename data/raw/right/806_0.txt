        More than 50,000 Americans have been killed by the coronavirus, according to data posted online by Johns Hopkins University on Friday.
Of the 50,031 victims, nearly one-third — 16,388 — died in New York City, the statistics show.
The national death toll is five times the milestone of 10,000 hit less than three weeks ago and puts COVID-19 on track to soon kill more than the 58,000 Americans who died during the Vietnam War.
With 870,468 confirmed coronavirus cases, the US has nearly four times more than Spain, which has the second-highest total of 219,764, according to Johns Hopkins.
