 Late yesterday House Speaker John Boehner announced the new Benghazi select committee will include seven Republicans and five Democrats. Because Republicans are the majority party in the House, they have also been appointed the majority on the committee. Before the partisan count was announced, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded the committee be split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, despite giving very little attention to Republicans during her time as Speaker in the majority. Now, even after being denied the same number of seats as Republicans on the panel because Democrats are in the minority, Pelosi is again asking for more Democrat power on the committee. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner late Tuesday urging him to reconsider plans to put seven Republicans and five Democrats on the panel. The House is expected to vote Thursday on the resolution establishing the committee, over Democratic objections.
"Another partisan review that serves only to politicize these attacks is disrespectful and unworthy of the American people," Pelosi and Hoyer wrote. Lets not forget that Democrats (acting like adults as usual) have already threatened not to participate in the Benghazi investigation at all. If they do decide to participate, you can expect to see Democrats enter hearings with a well thought out plan not to ask questions of witnesses, but to attack the credibility of Rep. Trey Gowdy leading the investigation. As we move forward, expect Democrats to protest nearly every part of this process in an effort to draw out the investigation to a point where bipartisan bickering turns everyone, including the public wanting more answers about Benghazi, off.
