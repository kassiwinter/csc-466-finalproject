Anthony Scaramucci, President Trump's new director of communications, railed against leaks Thursday, vowing to call the FBI and lambasting "senior leakers" in the White House who "think it is their job to save America from this president."Scaramucci seemed to insinuate that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who recently tried to block his appointment, might be among the culprits.The eruption was triggered by Politico's publication of the financial disclosure form that Scaramucci, who spent almost three decades on Wall Street, recently filed. The form, published Wednesday night, shows his assets as high as $85 million, and noted he made $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm, in the first six months of the year.Although Politico noted in the story that the documents are publicly available on request, Scaramucci responded angrily in a pair of tweets. “In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony,” he wrote, “I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept.”The tweet — which was later deleted — included the hashtag #swamp as well as the Twitter handle for Priebus.Asked by CNN's Chris Cuomo whether he was blaming Priebus, Scaramucci said, "the journalists know who are the leakers are, if Reince wants to explain that he is not a leaker, let him do that."At the same time, he denied he was charging Priebus with leaking, saying he only meant to include the chief of staff in the tweet to stress that senior officials needed to help cull out the perpetrators.Ryan Lizza, a writer for The New Yorker, added fuel to the fire, however, by saying on Twitter: "In case there's any ambiguity in his tweet I can confirm that Scaramucci wants the FBI to investigate Reince for leaking."In a series of media appearances Thursday morning, Scaramucci tried to back away from suggesting he was blaming Priebus for leaks, saying that in any case, White House leaks were "small potatoes" compared to leaks of North Korea or Syria.He did complain, however, that the guest list at a White House dinner Wednesday night, including President Trump, the first lady, Scaramucci and Fox host Sean Hannity was leaked "within seven minutes."He also lit into what he called "weak and insecure people" and "backstabbers" in his midst."There are people inside the administration that think it is their job to save America from this president. Ok?" he told CNN.At another point, he acknowledged the strain between him and the chief of staff, telling CNN: "I don't know if the relationship with Reince is reparable."In any case, he said that a major effort was underway to weed out the perpetrators.He told CNN that he had interviewed most of the assistants to the president and people working on the communications team. "What the president and I would like to tell everyone, we have a very, very good idea who the senior leakers in the White House are."As to whether he had come under heat over his high-profile outburst over the leaks, Scaramucci noted that he had spent 15 minutes with Trump on Thursday morning and that the president has given him "his full support and full blessing."The dustup over administration leaks also prompted a statement from the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI.Sarah Isgur Flores, a DOJ spokesperson, noted an "astonishing increase" in the number of leaks of classified national security information in recent months."We agree with Anthony that the staggering number of leaks are undermining the ability of our government to function and to protect this country," Flores said in a statement. "Like the attorney general has said, 'whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,' and we will aggressively pursue leak cases wherever they may lead."
