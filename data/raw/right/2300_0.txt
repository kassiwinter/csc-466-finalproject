Even before she announced she was running for president, Hillary Clinton sought to make the case to the American people that a Hillary Clinton administration would be much closer to a [Bill] Clinton third term than it would an Obama third term.  She boasted about the sound economic policies of the 90s, telling PBS in 2014, “If you want a better future that is going to be reliant on making smart economic policies, compare my husband’s eight years with Ronald Reagan’s eight years—23 million new jobs, more than seven million people lifted out of poverty.” Thus, it should come as no surprise that on the campaign trail over the weekend Clinton was very blunt about what role she’d have her husband play in her administration: fixing the economy.  "My husband, who I'm going to put in charge of revitalizing the economy, cause you know he knows how to do it," Clinton told the crowd at a campaign event in Kentucky on Sunday. "And especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out." And this isn’t the first time she reminded voters in Kentucky about how her husband would help them.  "I've told my husband he's got to come out of retirement and be in charge of this because you know he’s got more ideas a minute than anybody I know," she said.
