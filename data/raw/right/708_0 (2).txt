                                                                                                                                         The Obama administration took to the airwaves Sunday morning to call on Republicans to back the president’s plan for gun control.                                                                                                                                                      In interviews on “Fox News Sunday” and ABC’s “This Week,” Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House adviser, pointed out that 90 percent of Americans support President Obama’s plan to expand background checks  on citizens who purchase guns, and he pressured Republicans to get on  board with what he said where “common-sense measures.”                                                                                                                                                      “You can’t get 90 percent of Americans to agree on the weather,” Mr. Pfeiffer said on “Fox News Sunday.”                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Pfeiffer warned that a potential Republican filibuster is getting in the way of significant and meaningful gun-reform legislation.                                                                                                                              “It can get done, but what’s it’s going to require is for Republicans not to filibuster,” he said. “The question is: Are we  going to pass that bill, or are Republicans going to block it?”                                                                                                                                                                 He may have found a like-minded lawmaker in Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, who told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his party should not filibuster gun-control debates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Everybody wants the same goal, which is to keep the guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are mentally disabled,” Mr. McCain said.                                                                                                                              “I don’t understand (why they would filibuster),” he added. “The purpose of the Senate is to debate. Why not take it up and amend it and debate? I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate.”                                                                                                                              Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who is now the director of the National Rifle Association’s National School Shield Task Force, believes there should be armed guards in schools to protect teachers and students.                                                                                                                   “Whatever you do, even if you have universal background checks, bad guys are going to get guns, and it’s not going to diminish the need for security in schools,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”                                                                                                                 “You’re protecting children, and that’s a huge objective in life,” he added. “Should we not provide and protect our children while they go to school for an education?”                      But Mr.  Pfeiffer criticized these NRA suggestions, which are backed by many  Republicans, arguing the more guns will only ignite the situation.                      “There is no one who’s looked at these issues who thinks that that is the best response,” he said.                      “We should do more to make our schools safe, absolutely, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t also take common-sense measures that are supported by the majority of Americans.”
