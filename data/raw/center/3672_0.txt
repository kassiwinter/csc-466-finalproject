                                                  Rudy Giuliani, the attorney for President Trump, says Mr. Trump won’t consider special counsel Robert Mueller’s questions related to obstruction of justice until after the Russian collusion aspect of the probe is completed.

Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump’s legal team “would agree to written questions on Russia.” There has been “no further commitment on interviews,” he said.      Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, and whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct justice by firing Federal Bureau of Investigation Director         James Comey    in May 2017, while the FBI’s Russia probe was under way. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion and obstruction, and Moscow has denied election interference.     Mr. Giuliani described the latest legal strategy as essentially consisting of two consecutive parts: first, collusion, and second, obstruction. “After we finish this, we will assess it with no agreement to any postpresidential questions,” Mr. Giuliani said, referring to questions about events after Mr. Trump took office.               A spokesman for Mr. Mueller, who hasn’t publicly commented on the negotiations, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.     Last month, Mr. Giuliani told The Journal that Mr. Trump wouldn’t sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller after Sept. 1 because it could interfere with the midterm elections. At that time, he said the legal team had submitted a proposal to Mr. Mueller indicating Mr. Trump would take questions about collusion but not about obstruction of justice. The lawyers were concerned about a possible perjury trap.                                         When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word "Collusion" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain.
