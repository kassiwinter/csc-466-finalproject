         February 21st, 2014   09:57 PM ET       Protesters in Arizona are chanting "stop the hate" and hoping Governor Jan Brewer will stop a controversial 'religious rights' bill. It would allow business owners, as long as they assert it is their religious belief to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. Governor Brewer says she has not yet made up her mind. Miguel Marquez has the latest on the protests.
Anderson discussed this with Arizona State Representative John Kavanagh, who defends voting for this bill and New York University Professor Kenji Yoshino, who breaks down the legal jargon.
