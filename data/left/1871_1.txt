Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's presidential announcement certainly caught the attention of plenty of people on Tuesday, but not all of them supporters.The showman's use of Neil Young's "Rockin' In The Free World" was noticed by the singer himself, who declared he's no fan."Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' In The Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement," said a statement from Young's management company. "Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America."Trump used the tune to enter both his kick-off rally at Trump Tower in New York City and his speech in Iowa later Tuesday night.The real estate mogul and TV reality star launched his presidential campaign Tuesday, ending more than two decades of persistent flirtation with the idea of running for the Oval Office."So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again," Trump told the crowd in a lengthy and meandering 45-minute speech that hit on his signature issues like currency manipulation from China and job creation, while also taking shots at the president and his competitors on the Republican side."Sadly the American dream is dead," Trump said at the end of his speech. "But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before."CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.
