           Hillary Clinton has a narrow lead of just 4 points over Donald Trump in a new national poll released Sunday.
Clinton is backed by 47 percent of voters nationally in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. Trump is at 43 percent.
But that's a steep drop from a late June version of the same poll. Back then, Clinton held a 12-point lead, 51 to 39 percent.
And while Clinton in June held a 22-percent lead among college-educated white women, pollsters found that demographic is evenly split between the two candidates.
Clinton had a double-digit lead over Trump on handling race relations, an international crisis, immigration and helping the middle class.
Trump has a 15-point edge over Clinton among white voters, while 89 percent of blacks and 74 percent of Hispanics support Clinton.
The ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted July 11-14, has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
