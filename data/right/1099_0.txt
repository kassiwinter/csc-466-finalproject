But if companies can’t       bring talent to the U.S., they respond by shifting resources and research abroad,       according to       a study released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research.               Britta Glennon,    a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, examined data on 2,263 U.S. multinational       companies. When the cap on H-1B visas dropped precipitously in 2004, multinational       firms that were more reliant on the program expanded overseas, she found. The effect       was more pronounced among businesses that “were R&D-intensive.”        
Opinion Live Q&AAre the U.S. and China Headed for a New Cold War? Join WSJ Opinion’s Paul Gigot, Jillian Melchior and Jason Willick for a live online        discussion and Q&A on China-U.S. relations on Thursday, July 30.         Register Now with WSJ+        American multinationals, Ms. Glennon writes, “appear to have increased the share—not       just the levels—of their total employment and patenting to three main countries: Canada,       India, and China.” For context, U.S. multinationals, the study says, account for 80%       of American R&D and about a quarter of private employment.     One anecdotal example is       the 2007 announcement of a new         Microsoft    development center in Vancouver, Canada. The company specifically said that this       expansion would be near its home base, while letting it “recruit and retain highly       skilled people affected by immigration issues in the U.S.”                As a second methodology, Ms. Glennon made use of the fact that H-1B visas have been       allocated by lottery when applications exceed the cap. “I find that about 0.3 foreign       affiliate jobs were created for every unfilled H-1B position,” she writes. But that’s       “likely a lower bound,” since it doesn’t capture the behavior of newly formed companies       or foreign multinationals, and the latter “would be even more likely” to forgo U.S.       workers.     “In short,” the study concludes, “restrictive H-1B policies could not only be exporting       more jobs and businesses to countries like Canada, but they also could be causing       the U.S.’s innovative capacity to fall behind.” That’s a case for setting H-1Bs free,       Mr. Trump.
