The U.S. will impose new economic sanctions on two-dozen Russian individuals and entities for cyberattacks in the U.S. and meddling in the 2016 election, senior national security officials said Thursday.The Treasury Department will target five entities and 19 individuals from Russia for actions ranging from the “destabilizing efforts” in the 2016 presidential election to the “NotPetya” malware attack, the costliest and most disruptive in history.Treasury says it will freeze the assets and prohibit Americans from doing business with the accused Russians.Some of those entities and individuals — including the “Internet Research Agency,” which allegedly used fake social media accounts to sow division in the U.S. — have already been indicted by special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerAn unquestioning press promotes Rep.

They represent an aggressive action from Trump, who has been criticized for not doing enough to crack down on Moscow after his 2016 election victory.Treasury is sanctioning the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and 15 individuals or LLCs associated with it. Most of those individuals have already been charged in the Mueller investigation for allegedly setting up shop in the U.S. to run an interference campaign around the 2106 election.Treasury laid out a long list of accusations against the IRA, alleging the group “altered, or caused a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes and institutions.”Treasury accused the IRA of creating vast numbers of fake online personalities to pose as campaign organizers or interest groups; of posting thousands of fake campaign advertisements that reached millions of people online; of organizing political rallies on the left and right; and of opening bank accounts in the U.S. with stolen identities.Treasury has also targeted two Russian intelligence organizations in retaliation for what officials described as widespread and persistent cyberattacks.A group called the Federal Security Service used cyber tools to target journalists and politicians who were critical of the Russian government and is said to behind a 2014 hacking of Yahoo that compromised millions of email accounts.And Treasury sanctioned the Main Intelligence Directorate, along with a half-dozen people associated with the group, for being behind the “NotPetya” cyber-attack.Officials estimated that attack cost companies and individuals billions of dollars worldwide while wreaking havoc on the global shipping trade.- Updated at 11:45 a.m.
