WASHINGTON—Federal Communications Commission Chairman         Tom Wheeler    on Wednesday unveiled a proposal that would subject mobile and fixed broadband providers to utility-like regulations on how they treat traffic over their networks.The proposed rules would change broadband Internet access from a lightly regulated information service to a more strictly overseen telecommunications service. The FCC would use that new authority to ban broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or speeding up specific websites in exchange for payment.                                         FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler outlined several points that would ensure all internet traffic is treated equally.

Mr. Wheeler’s proposal is aimed at satisfying proponents of net neutrality—the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. They argue that without such rules, larger websites could gain an unfair advantage over startups and small companies that can’t afford to pay.     ”Using this authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by the FCC,” Mr. Wheeler wrote in a Wired op-ed. “My proposal assures the rights of Internet users to go where they want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new products without asking anyone’s permission.”          The five-member commission will vote on the proposal at its Feb. 26 meeting, the agency said.                The FCC has tried to impose net neutrality rules before, only to have a federal court strike them down, most recently in January 2014. Mr. Wheeler promised to act quickly to implement new rules, but his initial proposal last spring would have allowed some deals between websites and broadband providers.     That plan generated a widespread backlash from online activists, tech companies, investors and other net neutrality supporters, who flooded the FCC with more than 4 million comments last year. In November President         Barack Obama    called for the FCC to implement the “strongest possible rules,” including utility-like regulations.     Mr. Wheeler’s plan would regulate mobile and fixed broadband providers under Title II of the telecommunications law, the provision that applies to common carriers. The broadband industry has been strongly opposed to using Title II, arguing it would saddle companies with outdated regulations and depress investment in upgrading their networks.                  “The Internet economy, developed without federal regulation, is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise stagnant American economy.”                — Former FCC Commissioner             “The Internet economy, developed without federal regulation, is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise stagnant American economy. Regulating the Internet will not help America. It will hurt. It will discourage investment in networks,” said former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchgott-Roth, who is now an Internet expert at the conservative Hudson Institute.     Broadband industry officials have previously said they have no problem with a ban on special content deals, but they have indicated that will again sue if the commission moves ahead with Title II/utility-like regulation.     “Heavily regulating the Internet for the first time is unnecessary and counterproductive,”         Michael E. Glover,    a          Verizon Communications Inc.    senior vice president said in a statement. “It is unnecessary because all participants in the Internet ecosystem support an open Internet, and the FCC can address any harmful behavior without taking this radical step.”     He said a heavily regulatory approach would create uncertainty and “chill investment among the many players—not just Internet service providers—that now will need to consider FCC rules before launching new services.”     Mr. Glover also noted members of Congress are working on legislation that would codify the rules.      Mr. Wheeler said his proposal would avoid invoking many of the FCC’s Title II powers, including the authority to regulate broadband prices or mandate that broadband providers allow competitors to lease space on their networks.     Supporters of net neutrality cheered the announcement Wednesday.     “This announcement will set a clear framework for the innovation economy and the millions of jobs that depend on it across our nation. It marks a game-changing milestone for American innovations and consumers,” Sen.         Maria Cantwell    (D., Wash.) said in a statement.     Gene Kimmelman, CEO of the advocacy group Public Knowledge said the plan “signals that the Internet ecosystem will remain open to innovation and new opportunities for business development, social engagement and personal growth for all people.”     Write to Gautham Nagesh at gautham.nagesh@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
