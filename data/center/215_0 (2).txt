Two of the three members have since resigned.One of the recommendations the report makes is to allow the Capitol police chief to get a direct response from the National Guard rather than awaiting Pentagon approval.Media caption, Three accounts of politicians of the US Capitol riotCapitol police chief Steven Sund had begged for assistance only for the request to get bogged down in hours of calls with the Pentagon, which in turn wasted time in planning and seeking approval for a response, the report found. Mr Sund too has since resigned.Although Democrats have tried to set up a commission modelled on the 9/11 attacks inquiry to look into the riots, the attempt failed to get the 60 votes needed in the evenly divided Senate.More on this story
