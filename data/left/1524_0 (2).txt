Politics|Obama Plans Meetings on Ferguson Unrest at the White Househttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/us/politics/obama-plans-meetings-on-ferguson-unrest-at-the-white-house.htmlNov. 30, 2014WASHINGTON — President Obama is planning a day of meetings at the White House on Monday to respond to the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and racially tinged anger across the country after a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.Mr. Obama, who has labored to strike the right balance in reacting to the crisis, has not scheduled a trip to Ferguson despite days of speculation about a presidential visit there.But he will gather his cabinet on Monday to discuss the results of a review of federal programs that provide military-style equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies. The initiatives were called into question in August, after the Ferguson police responded with riot gear and assault-style weapons to protests in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown, the teenager, by Officer Darren Wilson.“As the country has witnessed, disintegration of trust between law enforcement agencies and the people they protect and serve can destabilize communities, undermine the legitimacy of the criminal justice system, undermine public safety, create resentment in local communities, and make the job of delivering police services less safe and more difficult,” a White House official said Sunday night, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the meetings.Mr. Obama has invited young civil rights leaders to the Oval Office later in the day to discuss “broader challenges we still face as a nation, including the mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color,” the official said.The president has faced a challenge in calibrating his response to the situation in Ferguson, working to balance the task of urging calm and unity with his desire, as America’s first black president, to acknowledge racial wounds — all while being careful not to interfere in the investigation.“Separate and apart from the particular circumstances in Ferguson, which I am careful not to speak to because it’s not my job as president to comment on ongoing investigations and specific cases,” Mr. Obama said last week in Chicago, “the frustrations people have generally — those are rooted in some hard truths that have to be addressed.”The president also is scheduled to meet on Monday with elected officials, law enforcement officials and community, civil rights and religious leaders from around the country to discuss ways they can work together to foster stronger communities.
