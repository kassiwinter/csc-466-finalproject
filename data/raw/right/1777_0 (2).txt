                                                                                                                   OPINION:                                                President Obama is celebrating Earth Day by flying in his jumbo jet down to Florida so he can tour the Everglades.                                                                                                                                                      The 1,836-mile roundtrip will consume 9,180 gallons of fuel on Air Force One, according to CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller. And that’s just the president’s plane.                                                                                                                                                      There will a half-dozen support planes along for the trip, Marine One helicopters, and a 25- to 30-vehicle motorcade belching exhaust into the air.                                                                                                                                                                    “While in Florida, the President will take a tour of the Everglades, and deliver remarks at Everglades National Park on the threat that climate change poses to our economy and to the world,” the White House said.                                                                                                                              Democratic presidents always make a big show on Earth Day.                                                                                                                                                       President Clinton once traveled to New England for an event, speeding through pristine forests in a massive motorcade. One of the vehicles smooshed a beaver trying to cross the road.
