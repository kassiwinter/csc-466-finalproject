A federal judge late Friday dealt a blow to the White House’s plans to build a wall along the southern U.S. border, blocking         Trump    administration officials from moving forward on construction projects with funds that Congress hadn’t approved.U.S. District Judge         Haywood Gilliam    in Oakland, Calif., said President Trump’s plans to divert federal money to build a border wall, absent appropriations from Congress, exceeded the executive’s authority. “Congress’s ‘absolute’ control over federal expenditures—even when that control may frustrate the desires of the Executive Branch regarding initiatives it views as important—is not a bug in our constitutional system,” Judge Gilliam, an Obama appointee, wrote in a 56-page decision. “It is a feature of that system, and an essential one.”     The judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocks the administration from proceeding on projects slated for immediate construction.          If and when the Trump administration announces additional projects at the border, the challengers in the case—environmentalists and southern border community organizations—can come back to court and seek an injunction against those as well, the judge said.        
Share Your ThoughtsWho do you believe has the legal authority to decide whether funding is committed to build a border wall—Congress or President Trump? Why? Join the conversation below.        The ruling is the first of its kind on the issue. Several other border-wall cases are pending around the country, including one in Washington, D.C., where the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is suing the Trump administration.     Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to requests for comments.     “This order is a win for our system of checks and balances, the rule of law, and border communities,” said         Dror Ladin,    an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented the plaintiffs.     The border-wall fight, one of the most divisive of the Trump presidency, led to a budget standoff, a 35-day government shutdown and eventually a national emergency declaration by Mr. Trump to divert money for wall construction from other government sources. Some, but not all, of the money the administration sought to spend was dependent on the president’s emergency declaration.     The administration almost certainly will appeal. Mr. Trump, in announcing his funding plans in February, predicted he would lose the early stages of litigation, especially in cases filed in liberal-leaning courts on the West Coast. He said he hoped to receive a better audience eventually at the Supreme Court.     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      The president made the construction of a physical barrier at the southern border a key element of his 2016 campaign. The 1,991-mile border currently has around 654 miles of barrier, dating back to the early 1990s. The administration contends that some of the barrier designs are outdated and need to be replaced with more robust material, such as steel bollard; in some areas, it is trying to erect barriers where there are none at present.     Mr. Trump signed a bill in February securing around $1.38 billion of funding from Congress for the 2019 fiscal year for approximately 55 miles of border wall, though the money came with specific restrictions barring construction in some sensitive areas. Lawmakers gave the president billions less in border-wall funds than he was seeking, so he declared a national emergency that he said would allow him to draw roughly $6.7 billion from military and other sources, without the approval of Congress, for an additional 234 miles of wall.     The emergency declaration drew widespread criticism from Democrats and objections from some Republicans. Both the House and Senate passed a resolution to terminate the declaration, but Mr. Trump issued a veto, the first of his presidency.     Judge Gilliam’s ruling twice quoted a Fox News interview with acting White House Chief of Staff         Mick Mulvaney,    who said the president would build the wall “with or without Congress.”     “The position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds ‘without Congress’ does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,” the judge wrote.                                         While President Trump has not been able to get Congress to act on his signature campaign issue of building a border wall, there’s another important immigration story developing. WSJ’s Gerald F.
