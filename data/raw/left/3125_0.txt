 (CNN)Rep. John Conyers, who is under fire for accusations of sexual harassment, is in the hospital Thursday, an aide to Conyers told reporters.Political consultant Sam Riddle said Conyers was hospitalized due to stress, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. "I just spoke with Monica Conyers on the phone and we want you to know that the congressman is resting comfortably in an area hospital. He's doing OK, as well as he can be expected for a gentleman that's approaching 90 years of age," Riddle said. "The congressman's health is not what it should be and lot of that is directly attributable to this media assault." A separate aide to Conyers confirmed to CNN that the Michigan Democrat was in the hospital. Neither was able to give additional details about Conyers' condition or where he was, though Conyers was in his home district at the time.Conyers, 88, is the longest currently serving member of the US House of Representatives. Conyers is facing several public allegations of sexual harassment. The House Ethics Committee announced last week it has opened an investigation into allegations against Conyers after BuzzFeed reported that he settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 after allegedly sexually harassing a staffer. Conyers denied wrongdoing in that case, but acknowledged that there had been a financial settlement to that complaint. Another former staffer, Deanna Maher, told CNN that Conyers made three sexual advances toward her when she worked for him in his district office in Detroit from 1997 to 2005. Through his lawyer, Conyers also denied wrongdoing in that case. CNN's Sara Ganim, Sarah Jorgensen and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.
