     ROME — Bernie Sanders privately met with Pope Francis at the pontiff’s residence in Vatican City on Saturday morning before the pope left on a trip for Greece.
The Democratic presidential candidate was joined by his wife Jane, advisor Jeffrey Sachs, Sachs’ wife, and Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo — who translated — for a roughly five-minute meeting before Pope Francis left for a trip to Greece, Sachs told POLITICO.
Sanders thanked the pope for his leadership on issues including the “moral economy,” the struggle to help the marginalized, income inequality, and climate change, telling the pontiff his encyclical on the matter had made a large difference to public attitudes, according to Sachs.
Francis thanked Sanders — who was stepping off the campaign trail days before the New York primary — for coming and asked him to pray for him, before leaving for Lesbos, where he was set to visit refugees.
The encounter was unannounced and there were no photographs taken. The Vatican press office had said in the days leading up to the conference that there was no meeting planned. The pope, a frequently-mentioned character in Sanders’ stump speech and campaign materials, was seen as unlikely to meet with Sanders due to his travel schedule.
The meeting in the foyer of the Domus of Santa Marta came about after the pope’s schedule meant he was unable to attend the conference Sanders was attending in Vatican City on Friday. At the time, he sent a hand-written note to conference attendees apologizing.
While Sanders was having dinner later on Friday night, he learned that the pope would like to meet before leaving for Greece.   Also On POLITICO
