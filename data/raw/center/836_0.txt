As the confirmed U.S. death toll from the new coronavirus grew to more than 71,000, new data showed the pandemic’s devastating impact on nursing homes. New York state has recorded at least 4,813 confirmed and presumed deaths related to the coronavirus at nursing homes and adult-care facilities, including 71 confirmed fatalities at one facility, according to state data released Monday night. The number has grown quickly. An April 22 tally showed 3,505 deaths in the facilities statewide. The figures included confirmed cases and probable cases from some nursing homes.     Globally, the number of deaths rose past 254,000, with 3.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Experts caution that reported infection and death tolls world-wide underestimate the extent of the pandemic.               In the U.S., 2,100 people were reported dead between 8 p.m. Monday and the same time Tuesday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data, bringing the nation’s official death toll to 71,022. It was the largest number of daily deaths reported in nearly a week.

Some nursing homes reported deaths of people presumed to have the virus as well as confirmed cases; others didn’t. The new numbers reflect the state’s effort to have more comprehensive reporting that includes both confirmed and presumed cases.     Nursing homes have faced scrutiny for problems containing the spread of the virus. Those who run the facilities say health authorities have put a higher priority on helping hospitals get staff and with personal-protective equipment.     State officials say they have sent hundreds of thousands of pieces of protective equipment to nursing homes.     Advocates for nursing-home residents, however, have said many facilities were ill-prepared for the pandemic, and many are chronically understaffed. Experts say elderly residents of facilities are particularly vulnerable due to their age and the congregate nature of the living arrangements.      In New Jersey, there have been 4,151 fatalities at long-term care facilities. Health officials are ramping up testing inside nursing homes to help curb the spread of the Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

Nearly one in four residents and 10% of staff tested positive, Judith Persichilli, commissioner of New Jersey’s Department of Health, said at a press conference Tuesday.      New Jersey Attorney General         Gurbir Grewal    said Tuesday his office was investigating the nursing-home industry’s response to Covid-19.      “We are not alleging any misconduct by any particular facility or any entity or any individual” as of today, Mr. Grewal said at the press conference. “We are gathering the facts. If the facts justify criminal charges, we’ll bring criminal charges. If those facts justify civil charges or would invoke civil liability, then that’s the route we’ll go.”     While the situation in the nation’s nursing homes remains fraught, there were signs of hope emerging from New York.         Gov. Andrew Cuomo    said the daily number of deaths and new hospitalizations from the infectious disease continued to decline early this week, signaling progress for the hard-hit state where 19,645 people have died.     But the Democratic governor cautioned that reopening too quickly could infect and kill more residents. With statewide stay-at-home rules set to expire in mid-May, the governor has outlined a phases approach that starts with construction and manufacturing, and progresses to the opening of schools and movie theaters.        
The Latest on the Coronavirus  Johns Hopkins: U.S. cases top 1.18 million; more than 70,000 have died. Johns Hopkins: World-wide cases pass 3.6 million, deaths top 254,000.  U.K. surpasses Italy to record the world’s second-highest death toll, according to official statistics        “There’s a cost of staying closed,” Mr. Cuomo said. “There’s also a cost of reopening quickly. That is the hard truth that we are all dealing with.”      “A human life is priceless. Period,” he added. “Our reopening plan doesn’t have a trade-off.”      States including Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma have taken larger steps in reopening businesses in the past week. Florida started reopening businesses on Monday. In Arizona, stores may reopen by the end of the week, Republican         Gov. Doug Ducey    said, while groups of up to 20 people would be permitted to gather outdoors in Mississippi, the GOP governor there said.      Democratic         Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker    outlined a phased reopening plan Tuesday. It allows some businesses in parts of the state to reopen with certain restrictions in place. The state reported 176 deaths from the virus, the highest number of reported deaths from the virus over a 24-hour period thus far.      “Until we have a vaccine or an effective treatment or enough widespread immunity that new cases fail to materialize, the option of returning to normalcy doesn’t exist,” he said. “That means we have to figure out how to live with Covid-19 until it can be vanquished.”        
Coronavirus Resources                 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott,    a Republican, accelerated his state’s opening Tuesday with an announcement that salons and gyms would be able to resume operations within the next two weeks. Hair, nail and tanning salons will be allowed to open Friday, with a limit of one customer per stylist. Gyms will be allowed to open May 18, at 25% capacity.     The reopening plans came as projections show deaths in the U.S. could nearly double in the coming months. Deaths in the U.S. could approach 135,000 by early August, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produces a forecast sometimes cited by the White House. The model is one of several that researchers have developed to chart the potential path of the disease, with some predicting more dire scenarios than others.              Deborah Birx,    the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, took issue Tuesday with the death projection, saying she didn’t think the group fully took into account the mitigation measures states are putting in place.     Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Tuesday the administration was talking about phasing out the White House coronavirus task force and shifting response efforts to individual departments and agencies, possibly by early June. The task force’s physicians would continue to advise President Trump on his handling of the pandemic, administration officials said.      Researchers, meanwhile, have begun testing an experimental coronavirus vaccine by         Pfizer Inc.    and partner         BioNTech SE,    injecting healthy volunteers with the first of four vaccine candidates from the companies.

But the toll of sustained shutdowns continued to mount. Amid a decline of global travel during the pandemic, Airbnb Inc. is cutting 1,900 employees, or 25% of its workforce.      The U.K. surpassed Italy to record the world’s second-highest death toll, although discrepancies in the way governments record Covid-19 fatalities make cross-country comparisons difficult.                            confirmed cases in the U.S.                 total deaths in the U.S.                   Source: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering       The country’s death toll stood at 29,427 Tuesday, according to a daily count released by the government that tracks deaths where coronavirus infection has been confirmed. Official statistics published earlier Tuesday that include deaths where a physician suspected Covid-19 was a factor point to an even greater number of deaths. Italy’s toll Tuesday stood at 29,315.     In mainland China, where the virus first emerged, officials reported just one new case on Monday, which officials said was imported from outside the country. China reported no new deaths as of midday Tuesday.     Iran reported a rise in coronavirus infections for a second day in a row, following weeks of slowing contagion. Singapore, which has struggled to contain outbreaks at tightly packed immigrant worker dormitories, a top health official said the country had a long way to go to contain the virus.        
The Coronavirus Around the World        Concerns grew about the impact of the virus on some nations in Latin America such as Brazil, which lack the institutions and infrastructure to carry out programs like widespread testing, let alone the hospitals to care for surges in extremely ill patients. Brazil’s confirmed infections have recently risen by about 5,000 a day and its known death toll, 7,288, now exceeds China’s. But, some researchers say, there is so little testing that the total may be far higher. One university study estimated Brazil may have more cases than the U.S.
