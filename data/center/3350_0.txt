WASHINGTON—A little over a year after withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President      Donald Trump        has asked his top economic advisers to study the possibility of re-entering the trade pact negotiations.Mr. Trump has deputized         Robert Lighthizer,    the U.S. trade representative, and         Larry Kudlow,    the director of the National Economic Council, to study the possibility of re-entering the TPP if the terms were favorable, the president told a group of lawmakers on Thursday. The president’s new openness toward the TPP, which he had said during his campaign was a deal “pushed by special interests who want to rape our country,” comes as he is facing criticism from farmers and looking for allies in his escalating trade battle with China. Beijing had long feared that Washington would use the TPP, envisioned as having 12 members, as a way to try to contain China economically.     “You can explain this initiative entirely in the context of U.S-China relations,” said Gary Hufbauer, a trade specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Trump has got to get some allies. As of now (China’s President) Xi has the upper hand in world opinion.”          In a late-night tweet, Mr. Trump set a high bar for success in any revived TPP talks, saying the U.S. would “only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to         Pres. Obama.    ” He said the U.S. already has two-way trade deals with six TPP nations, and would continue pushing for one with Japan.                After Mr. Trump in recent weeks took aim at China with new steel and aluminum tariffs, the two nations have issued tit-for-tat retaliatory levies on various imports.Beijing responded by announcing it would place penalties on a list of agricultural products that would affect swaths of the president’s political base. Mr. Trump has since threatened tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports over a fight involving intellectual property. Once again, China retaliated by threatening to add levies on imports of U.S. agriculture.        
Related        Mr. Trump was meeting with lawmakers from states that rely on agriculture when he made the comments about TPP.         Sen. Ben Sasse,    a Nebraska Republican who was in the meeting with the president Thursday, said he believed Mr. Trump was serious about his interest in re-entering the trade pact. “That’s really good news for America,” Mr. Sasse said.     This isn’t the first time Mr. Trump has said he had some expressed interest in reviving TPP. At a January meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland—a meeting of political and business true-believers in globalization—, he said he would “consider negotiating” U.S. re-entry into the pact.     A month later at a news conference with Australian Prime Minister         Malcolm Turnbull,    Mr. Trump said “there’s a possibility we would be going in” if the U.S. was offered better terms.     Since then, Trump officials say, the administration has done almost no preparatory work necessary to renegotiate the trade deal. There haven’t been any position papers on what the administration would seek in a new TPP or how it would try to convince other nations to agree to its terms. There also hasn’t been any interagency process set up to review TPP, according to officials.                                         President Trump made a point on his first day in office in 2017 to formally remove the U.S. from the TPP. WSJ’s Gerald F. Seib explains how Trump’s campaign promises on trade might play out.

The TPP aimed to counter China’s economic influence in Asia, which aligns with Mr. Trump’s recent decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports. Many U.S. businesses have worried that America’s exit from the TPP would give advantages to foreign competitors, who would be able to sell to those markets at reduced tariffs and under harmonized rules. After the U.S. withdrew, the 11 nations concluded a less ambitious version of the deal, called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.     Withdrawing the U.S. from TPP was one of Mr. Trump’s first actions as president, fulfilling one of his main campaign promises as he sought support among blue-collar families who blamed international trade deals for the decline in manufacturing jobs.     Mr. Trump on Monday acknowledged that U.S. farmers were caught up in his administration’s burgeoning trade dispute with China, and asked the Agriculture Department for a list of options to mitigate the economic hit. Before China announced its tariffs last week, net farm income in 2018 was already projected to decrease by 6.7%, to $59.5 billion, the lowest level in more than a decade, according to an Agriculture Department forecast updated last month.     A group of 25 Republican senators sent Mr. Trump a letter in February asking him to “re-engage with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”     Before Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from TPP, the trade pact faced tough odds against passage in Congress. Democratic presidential candidate         Hillary Clinton    opposed the deal, as did her opponent in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders and most Democratic lawmakers. Many Republican lawmakers also had reservations.     Seeking to change the agreement in big enough ways to assuage domestic critics on the left and right would probably upset a careful balance with the 11 other countries in the deal. “There is no conceivable way to revive it without totally betraying working people,” tweeted         Richard Trumka,    president of the AFL-CIO.      Still, Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council, said in London on Thursday that the U.S. would consider rejoining the TPP if it could agree on more desirable terms.     “It’s something that’s of interest,” Mr. Eissenstat said at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council in London.     “We’re engaged in a number of dialogues. Will that eventually culminate in something like TPP? We’ll have to see. There’s a lot of work to be done,” Mr. Eissenstat said.     —Jason Douglas and Bob Davis contributed to this article.
