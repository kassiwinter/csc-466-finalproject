The DOJ argued that breaching grand jury secrecy would have a chilling effect on future witnesses.In March, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit ruled that the House's impeachment inquiry justified its request for the sealed documents."The Department has objected to disclosure of the redacted grand jury materials, but the Department has no interest in objecting to the release of these materials outside of the general purposes and policies of grand jury secrecy, which as discussed, do not outweigh the Committee’s compelling need for disclosure," Judge Judith Rogers wrote for the majority.
