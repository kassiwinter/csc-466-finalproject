PHOENIX—President      Donald Trump,        in his first rally after the violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month, attacked the news media and his fellow Republicans who were critical of his response to the protest.In an address of more than an hour, Mr. Trump accused the news media of “fomenting divisions” and attacked his GOP colleagues for failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He also urged supporters to press lawmakers on the overhaul of the tax code. Mr. Trump’s remarks about the Charlottesville violence—which initially oscillated between condemning the white supremacists and saying that “both sides” were to blame—were criticized by lawmakers, business leaders and civil-rights groups. The White House had sought to end those defections on Monday with a somber statement that unequivocally rejected bigotry and racism.      At the rally, Mr. Trump issued a forceful condemnation of “the thugs” who perpetrate hatred and violence.          “What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America,” he said.      But Mr. Trump also reiterated his previous criticism of efforts to remove Confederate monuments, including a statue of Civil War general Robert E. Lee, which sparked the demonstration in Charlottesville.     “They are trying to take away our history and our heritage,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday of the news media.     The rally was the latest example of the White House’s struggle to control its narrative. The White House on Tuesday had sought to highlight the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement policy with the president’s tour of a border protection facility in Yuma, Ariz     “We’re finally defending our own borders,” Mr. Trump said later in the rally Tuesday.

Ahead of the rally, protesters denounced the president as supporters queued to enter the arena in downtown Phoenix, where a heavy police presence reflected local officials’ concern about the chance of violence. Supporters of the president chanted “Build that wall” in the direction of a Trump critic waving an American flag, who shook his finger and repeatedly responded, “With your tax money.”     Some of his loudest cheers of the night came when he praised former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for defying a judge’s order to stop conducting immigration patrols in the state. Mr. Trump has hinted in recent weeks that he is considering pardoning Mr. Arpaio, but didn’t do so on Tuesday evening.

Mr. Trump sought the support of his crowd to move his agenda. While he largely refrained from naming any Republicans, he pointed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s failure by one vote to pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Arizona Sen.         John McCain,    the Republican who cast one of the fatal votes on the repeal bill.     “One vote. Speak to your senator, please,” the president said before a boisterous crowd.     What started as largely peaceful protests turned raucous following the conclusion of Mr. Trump’s remarks, as Phoenix police deployed tear gas, pepper balls and loud flash bangs to disband the crowds.      Protesters dispersed, coughing and with burning eyes. Some Trump supporters exiting the convention center appeared largely unaware of the scene unfolding on the street. Others stopped from a sky bridge to take pictures of the tear gas billowing on Monroe Street as they exited the rally.     Sgt. Jonathan W. Howard, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, said there had been “one or two arrests” by around 10 p.m. local time. “A small amount of the crowd” was still in the street, he said, adding that police were “still working to disperse them.”                                                  Protesters after Phoenix police used tear gas outside the Phoenix Convention Center.

Mr. Trump arrived in town as he is feuding with Jeff Flake, Arizona’s junior senator who has been critical of the president’s trade and border-wall plans and decried his Charlottesville remarks. Mr. Trump in turn has called Mr. Flake, one of the Republican Party’s most vulnerable incumbents in 2018, “toxic” and “weak on borders.”     In a tweet last week, Mr. Trump praised one of Mr. Flake’s primary challengers, Kelli Ward. “Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake,” he wrote.     Mr. Trump on Tuesday didn’t mention Mr. Flake by name, but alluded to him, saying: “Nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who is weak on borders, weak on crime.” He added: “I haven’t mentioned any names, so now everybody’s happy.”     Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com, Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com and Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
