Kind of.      Read more                     As he tried to make the case for military reform, Mr. Sanders cited the jaw-dropping cost of maintaining nuclear weapons. Depending on the context, his numbers can be seen as accurate -- or off. Here are the facts: The United States is projected to spend $348 billion, or $35 billion a year, to maintain its nuclear arsenal over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of the Obama administration's nuclear plans.         — Steve Eder     Close           Mrs. Clinton said that wages, when adjusted for inflation, have been stagnant since the end of the Clinton administration.              True, but the credit is misplaced.

True, but it didn't go far.      Read more                     In defending her record on Wall Street, Mrs. Clinton cited a (rather obscure) piece of legislation that she introduced while in the United States Senate to clamp down on executive compensation.          While it is true that she introduced a bill called the Corporate Executive Compensation Accountability and Transparency Act in April 2008, the proposal did not go very far. The record shows that the bill was introduced, with no co-sponsors, and referred to the Committee on Finance. No further action was taken, Senate records show.         — Steve Eder     Close           Mr. O'Malley said parents and students were being charged 7% to 8% interest on government-backed college loans.              Overstated.      Read more                     In bemoaning the high cost of higher education, Mr. O'Malley cited 7 to 8 percent interest rates charged by the government for loans. Those numbers, according to data from the Department of Education, are higher than what most students would pay in interest these days. The truth is that the most common federal loans for undergraduate students carry an interest rate of just over 4 percent.         — Steve Eder     Close
