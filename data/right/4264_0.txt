Rahm to Sue Chicago Teachers
The Chicago teachers union has decided to continue their strike, depriving students of teachers for another week, entrenching an increasingly public and bitter labor dispute.
Reports said that the union’s delegates would meet on Tuesday, meaning that schools in the nation’s third largest school district would be unlikely to open before Wednesday. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has now threatened to sue to force the end of the strike and force the unions back into the classrooms to teach Chicago children.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he will file a court injunction to force an end to the Chicago teacher's strike which is heading into its second week.
By refusing to call off the strike, the union continues months of public sparring between union leaders and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose school reform agenda centered on lengthening what had been among one of the shortest public school days in the country. This ugly strike looks to continue as the Chicago teachers refuse to accept strict evaluations and an increased workday. President Obama has refused to comment to support or condemn either side of the debate.
