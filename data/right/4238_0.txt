                 	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez        Getty Images                       Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded Tuesday to a minor league baseball team that aired a video portraying her as an “enemy of freedom” and put her picture next to Kim Jong Un and Fidel Castro.
The Bronx Democrat wrote in a series of tweets that messages like the one shown on a screen during the Fresno Grizzlies’ Memorial Day event cause death threats against her to increase.
“What people don’t (maybe do) realize is when orgs air these hateful messages, my life changes bc of the flood of death threats they inspire,” she wrote Tuesday on Twitter.
“I‘ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it’s always men) who want to kill me,” she added.
In the video that aired at Chukchansi Park, the voice of President Ronald Reagan warned of “enemies of freedom” and a photo of Ocasio-Cortez appeared with Kim and former Cuban leader Castro, local station KFSN reported.
The congresswoman’s tweet came after the ballclub posted an apology to her on the social media site.
”We’re embarrassed we allowed this video to play without seeing it in its entirety first,” the Grizzlies posted on Twitter Tuesday. “We unconditionally apologize to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) in addition to our fans, community and those we hurt. It was a mistake and we will ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.”
Ocasio-Cortez also stressed that “words matter” and affect her personal life.
“All of this is to say that words matter, and can have consequences for safety,” she wrote in another tweet.
“For those who believe in ‘free speech’: whose free speech do you believe in?”
