NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!  Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Sunday that his new budget includes the repeal of President Obama’s health-care reform law known as ObamaCare.Ryan told “Fox News Sunday” that the new proposal will make enough cuts to balance the federal budget in 10 years, compared to his previous one that tried to achieve that goal in 25 years.“We think we owe the American people a balanced budget,” the Republican congressman said.Ryan said the focus of the ObamaCare repeal would be to stop the expansion of Medicaid, the federal program that provides medical services to low-income U.S. families.“Our budget does promote repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with a better system,” said Ryan, who did not say whether his 2014 budget is based on a full repeal.More On This... Ryan, the Republican 2012 vice presidential nominee, said he wants states to run Medicaid through federal block grants.Ryan said his proposal attempts to reach a balanced budget, in part, by slowing the rate of federal spending from 4.9 percent to 3.4 percent. Other parts include consolidating federal job-training programs and reforming the federal Food Stamps program to ensure only qualified applicants receive the benefits.“I’ve very confident this is the way to go,” said Ryan, whose budget would have a better chance of passing the Republican-controlled House than the Democrat-controlled Senate.
