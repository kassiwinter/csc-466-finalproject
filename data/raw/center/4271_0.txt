A Democratic-controlled House committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for ignoring its subpoena seeking information about efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The vote, mostly along party lines, recommended that Congress hold Messrs. Barr and Ross in contempt and came hours after President Trump asserted executive privilege over documents demanded by the House Oversight Committee. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the census question soon. The assertion of privilege, designed to keep the documents out of the hands of Congress, was made in a letter to Congress from the Justice Department on Wednesday morning. A day earlier, Mr. Barr sent a letter to Mr. Trump asking him to take the step, according to a letter to the committee from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd.                                         The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether a question regarding citizenship can be included in the 2020 census. WSJ’s Lorie Hirose takes a look at the debate.

The developments mark the latest twist in the fight between the White House and congressional investigators on a range of issues. In a separate matter involving Mr. Barr, the House Judiciary Committee this week backed off on a plan to hold him in contempt after a deal was reached over materials related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow.     The oversight panel subpoenaed the census-related documents two months ago, and the contempt vote by the panel allows the committee to potentially take the action to federal court—where committee attorneys could ask a judge to enforce the subpoena, an aide said. The House on Tuesday approved a resolution to allow committees to seek enforcement of their own subpoenas for testimony and documents, without having to go through another vote by the full House.     Following the passage of the contempt resolution by the panel, Democrats have two options: pursue a civil contempt-of-Congress finding through the bipartisan legal advisory group, or a criminal contempt finding that would require a vote by the full House, a Democratic committee aide said. The Democrats didn’t immediately say what their plans were regarding contempt or possible lawsuits.      Any lawsuit could set up a constitutional clash between the branches. The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a congressional demand for information can overcome an executive-privilege claim, and a ruling could reshape the relationship between Congress and presidential administrations.     Republicans accused the panel of rushing to a contempt vote when the departments have said they would cooperate and send more people to the panel for interviews. On Wednesday, Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.) asked the panel to wait until after the Supreme Court’s ruling.        
Share Your ThoughtsShould the census ask about your citizenship status? Why? Why not? Join the conversation below.        Mr. Trump has publicly backed the new census question. In comments to reporters Wednesday, he said: “I think it’s totally ridiculous that we would have a census without asking” about citizenship. He added: “But the Supreme Court is going to be ruling on it soon.”     The census fight centers on the addition of a citizenship question to the survey, held every 10 years. In a December 2017 letter to the Census Bureau, an assistant attorney general at the time, Arthur Gary, asked that the citizenship question be added to improve enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protects minority voters.     Three federal courts have blocked adding the question, ruling that the Commerce Department, which oversees the census, failed to comply with federal laws requiring transparency and a reasonable basis for policy changes. The Supreme Court, which heard the government’s appeal in March, is expected to rule on the matter later this month.     The U.S. census traditionally counts all residents and doesn’t distinguish between citizens and noncitizen residents. Opponents of the question say it would intimidate people who aren’t citizens, or those who live with people who aren’t citizens, from responding, bringing a distorted allocation of federal resources and congressional representation to areas with higher minority concentrations.        
Related        Others argue the question serves an important purpose. “Why don’t Democrats want to know how many citizens are in the country?” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the oversight committee.     The census will be used to determine the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives for the coming decade. An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice determined that Texas and Florida could gain seats, while Alabama, Illinois and Michigan could lose a seat.     Representatives of the Commerce and Justice departments say they have provided thousands of pages to the oversight panel and argue the specific documents that Democrats are seeking are part of litigation and therefore can’t be released. Mr. Boyd said in a letter Wednesday that the Justice Department “has made ongoing and continued effort toward accommodation.” In the course of the investigation, the department has submitted more than 17,000 pages of documents.     Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday evening, “The Committee’s attempt to define the Department of Justice’s good-faith cooperation as ‘contempt’ defies logic.”     Congress’s contempt power—and the threat of it—has long been used to combat noncompliance with a subpoena. In June 2012, a GOP-controlled House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress after he refused to provide documents. He was the first sitting attorney general in U.S. history to be held in contempt. That legal battle was finally settled last month.     Executive privilege, or the doctrine that some executive branch communications can be shielded from scrutiny, has been blessed by the Supreme Court. That privilege isn’t absolute. In the landmark 1974 case United States v. Nixon, the court ordered President Nixon to turn over material he said was privileged to a prosecutor conducting a criminal inquiry.     The Nixon case, however, addressed a criminal investigation, not a congressional probe.     —Byron Tau contributed to this article.
