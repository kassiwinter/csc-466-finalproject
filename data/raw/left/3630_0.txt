A pirate radio station which aired Alex Jones' show has been shut down by the Federal Communications Commission.Liberty Radio was broadcasting on 90.1 FM without federal consent, according to The Austin American-Statesman reported that with the FCC accusing the station had done so since 2013.
FCC agents managed to trace the station's signal to an apartment block in East Austin, following a complaint, according to the agency's lawsuit filed against Liberty Radio. The FCC has also handed a $15,000 penalty to the station's owners, who reportedly are refusing to pay.Liberty Radio said on its website that it had stopped broadcasting terrestrially since last December, but still maintains an online stream.The station's schedule features InfoWars programs, including The Alex Jones Show, Real News with David Knight, and War Room. "We are committed to spreading the word of truth. We have chosen the best schedule possible to accomplish this endeavor," reads a statement on its website.Liberty Radio's punishment is not connected to airing Jones' show, but the hubbub comes after Twitter gave Jones' personal account a 7-day timeout, preventing him from tweeting, retweeting, or liking content because he violated the platform's rules. Other tech companies have taken a stronger stand on InfoWars and Jones, notably Apple and Spotify who have removed his podcasts from their platform.Correction: Aug. 17, 2018, 6:54 p.m. PDT Liberty Radio aired Alex Jones' show, but was not his "flagship station," as previously reported. The story has been corrected to reflect this.
