The suspect in the fatal shooting of two New York City police officers apparently posted threats on social media that showed a desire for revenge after the deaths of black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown in encounters with police.Shortly before the shooting, Instagram user "dontrunup" posted a photo of a silver handgun with wooden grips and the caption: "I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours … Let's take 2 of theirs. #Shootthepolice #RIPErivGardner #RIPMikeBrown This may be my final post … I'm putting pigs in a blanket."Police found a silver handgun by the body of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound in a subway station after running from the scene where Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot in their parked patrol car Saturday afternoon.The user's next post shows what appears to be a bloodstained pants leg and the caption "Never had a hot gon on your waist and blood on your shoe … you aint been through what I been through you not like me and I'm not like you."The account was suspended shortly after the shooting.The Instagram account is linked to Facebook user Bleau Barracuda, who police said appears to be Brinsley.The last Facebook status made on that account a few hours before the shootings said, "I Always Wanted To Be Known For Doing Something Right....... But My Past Is Stalking Me And My Present Is Haunting Me."Photos posted to that Facebook account show pictures of Brinsley in cities across the country, including Las Vegas and Boston.New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said Brinsley had ties to the Brooklyn area but had been living in Georgia.Records in Cobb County, Ga., show Brinsley was arrested in July 2011 in connection with alleged violent offenses. He was charged with felony possession of a firearm, discharging a firearm, obstructing a police officer, criminal damage of property and theft by receiving, according to records in Cobb County Court.He was ordered to pay $1,700 in fines and fees and was released on probation. Brinsley's probation was revoked in June 2013, according to the records.Court records in Clark County, Ohio, show Brinsley was arrested on a felony robbery charge in June 2009. The case was dismissed in September 2009, the records show.Contributing: Jane Onyanga-Omara, Kevin McCoy, USA TODAY; Associated Press
