 Last night President Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail to stump for Wisconsin Democrat Mary Burke, who is challenging Governor Scott Walker. During Obama's speech, in particular the moment when he encouraged people to vote and to knock on doors for Burke, people were caught on video filing out of the room.Â Last week the same thing happened when President Obama spoke in deep blue Maryland.
