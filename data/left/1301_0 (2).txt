Republican strategist Karl Rove blamed President Obama and conservatives Tuesday for making impeachment seem like a much more realistic possibility than it is."This man is playing with the American people by suggesting a constitutional crisis where none exists," Rove said on Fox News's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." "Shame on him, and shame on those people in his administration who participate with him. And shame on those conservatives and Republicans who help him along. The president wants nothing more than Congressman Yoho, of Florida, to step forward and say we must do it."The former top aide to President George W.

Last week, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told reporters he "would not discount" the possibility.GOP leaders have repeatedly said they have no interest in impeaching the president.
