                 | January 01, 2021 02:33 PM                The Senate voted to override President Trump’s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, providing the president his first and likely only veto defeat.      The likely final vote of the current Congress provided more than the two-thirds needed to force the NDAA into law over Trump’s objection.             The critical defense and policy bill sets 2021 spending levels at $740 billion and provides important directives to the Defense Department for the coming years. It also includes a significant infusion of funding for cybersecurity, which lawmakers touted in the wake of a recent, massive hack by the Chinese.      “This is really a significant vote,” Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe, said. “This year, especially so. Show the American people that Republicans and Democrats can work together.”       “This legislation is essential to the security of the United States and to the welfare of the troops who defend us every day,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the panel, added.       Trump has vetoed nine bills during his presidency and all but the NDAA were sustained.      Trump vetoed the bill for several reasons but mainly because it excludes a provision that would strip lawsuit liability protections from Big Tech.
