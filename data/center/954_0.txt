Philonise Floyd said Wednesday that he's seeking only one thing from Congress in the wake of his brother's death two weeks ago: "Justice for George."Floyd spoke the words Wednesday morning in the Capitol as he headed into a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee to examine police brutality and Congress's role in preventing it.Once the hearing began, he offered an emotional opening statement as he described watching the video of his brother's death. A Minneapolis police officer, who has since been fired and charged with second-degree murder, pinned George Floyd to the street by placing his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds."I couldn’t take care of George that day he was killed," Philonese Floyd testified. "But maybe by speaking with you today, I can make sure that his death would not be in vain.""George called for help and he was ignored. Please listen to the call I’m making to you now, to the calls of our family, and the calls ringing out in the streets across the world."Minneapolis police officers arrested Floyd on May 25 after a convenience store worker alleged that Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes."He didn’t deserve to die over twenty dollars. I am asking you, is that what a black man is worth?" Floyd said during his testimony.Floyd lamented that "I can't tell you the kind of pain you feel" while watching a video like the one of his brother's death."I didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to Perry while he was here. I was robbed of that," Floyd said, referring to his brother with a nickname, as he tried to hold back tears.Floyd's death — the latest in a string of unarmed African Americans killed by police — has led to days of protests across the nation calling for police reforms.Congressional leaders of both parties have vowed to create laws aimed at reining in racial profiling and police brutality.Rep.

On Monday, she introduced legislation to bring more accountability to policing by, among other things, mandating body cameras, outlawing chokeholds and creating a federal database exposing officers with patterns of abuse.Entering Wednesday's hearing, Bass said she's hoping the witnesses will guide the legislation as it moves through Congress in the coming weeks. George Floyd's death, she added, has opened the public's eyes to systemic problems in the criminal justice system, providing Congress with a unique opportunity to address them."I believe we're at a real inflection point in our country," Bass said.The House Judiciary Committee is expected to advance Democrats' police reform legislation next week, with a vote on the House floor likely to come the following week.Republicans seized upon calls by some activists and progressives to "defund the police," even though Democratic leaders in Congress and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe BidenJoe BidenCory Booker and Rosario Dawson have reportedly split US ups estimate of Russian forces on Ukraine border to 130,000 Harris heads to Munich at pivotal moment MORE have distanced themselves from the push.Rep.

And you will be able to count on Republican cooperation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the president's desk," Gaetz said.Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, also argued that "defunding" police departments would be counterproductive and undermine investments in reforms like body cameras and bias training.At the same time, Acevedo said, "We must acknowledge that law enforcement's past contains institutional racism, injustices and brutality."In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellRepublicans take cheap shots at Fed nominees Republicans do not have a right to remain silent White House uses GOP's own rhetoric to rebut Supreme Court criticisms MORE (R-Ky.) has tapped Sen.
