Another congressional Republican will not support Ohio Rep. John Boehner’s bid to become Speaker of the House.In a piece published on Breitbart.com, Rep. Steve King (Iowa) indicated he “can’t vote for John Boehner again.”“When a president does violence to our Constitution, those who also take an oath to our Constitution have an absolute duty to defend it,” King wrote. “We need a Speaker of the House who carries in his bones the conviction of our oath.”At least two other Republicans have indicated they may challenge Boehner for the speakership: Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) and Rep. Ted Yoho (Fla.).“At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate,” Gohmert said in a statement, as The Washington Post’s Sean Sullivan reported. “It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands. I am putting forward my name for consideration as Speaker and hope that with a new Speaker, be that me or someone else, we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in November.”In a recent poll, 60 percent of Republicans would prefer “someone new” to Boehner, as The Post’s Aaron Blake reported last week.This, of course, doesn’t mean fellow legislators will support another representative’s bid for the top spot.“Boehner not only won’t be ousted as speaker in the 114th Congress but has, inarguably, a stronger hand heading into the new session in January than he did for the past two years,” The Post’s Chris Cillizza predicted.King’s beef with Boehner: allowing the passage of Obamacare and what King called the White House’s “executive amnesty” on immigration.“It takes a Speaker who both understands and believes his sworn duty is to use all the powers of his office to defend and restore the proper constitutional balance of powers,” King wrote. “Instead, our Speaker has placed Obama’s executive amnesty on the path to permanent full funding.”
