      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will announce this week whether she will create a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, her spokesman said.      The California Democrat told colleagues about her plans during a meeting of the House Steering and Policy Committee on Tuesday, which comes weeks after Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have created a commission to dig into the attack on Congress.            CNN ANCHORS SLAM 'BULLS*** FACTORY EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' TUCKER CARLSON FOR JAN. 6 CLAIMS      Multiple news outlets reported the speaker revealed she would create the committee, which would not require GOP support. But Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, quickly tweeted a denial.       "Speaker Pelosi told Members she plans to announce WHETHER she will create a select committee THIS WEEK," he said. "Her preference continues to be a bipartisan commission which Senate Republicans are blocking."      Manu Raju, a reporter for CNN, tweeted, "But even after her denial, a source who heard the speaker said she had indicated she had given the Senate a few weeks to act and that the existing House committees are too big and unwieldy. Select committee will be named, the source said."
