Didn’t they apologize for the fact that they said certain things that weren’t true? Tell me, what was their apology yesterday? What did they say?”Acosta fired back, “Mr. President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes.”     CNN’s Jim Acosta has become a hero among liberals for his combative style when questioning President Trump.

The CNN reporter emerged as a hero among progressives early in Trump administration. He also made a habit of shouting questions and feuding with former press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders.Acosta’s star has fizzled as the White House has reduced the number of press briefings in favor of gaggles and interviews, limiting Acosta’s opportunity to draw attention to himself.The CNN reporter was briefly banned from the White House back in 2018 after engaging in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a press conference, in which he seemed to refuse to pass the microphone to a female White House aide.CNN CONTINUES OBSESSION ABOUT TRUMP’S EATING HABITS, THIS TIME OVER FOOD OPTIONS IN INDIA Acosta’s press pass was eventually restored after CNN argued that keeping him out of the White House violated the network and Acosta’s First and Fifth Amendment rights.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAcosta’s 2019 book, “The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,” was billed as “an explosive, first-hand account of the dangers [Acosta] faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump’s war on truth” as “public enemy number one.”
