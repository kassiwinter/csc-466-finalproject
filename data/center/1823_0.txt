In legal terms, it determines whether probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed.Ms James expressed disappointment with the grand jury's verdict, alluding to other cases in which officers had not been held accountable for "the unjustified killing of unarmed African Americans".Mr Prude's death was one of the key events in months of unrest over racial injustice in the US last year.More on deaths in police custody:Media caption, The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutalityHis arrest bore similarities to that of George Floyd, who died in police custody a few months later in Minnesota.Mr Prude, 41, had been suffering from acute mental health problems when his brother called police.When they arrived, officers found Mr Prude running naked in the street near his brother's home in Rochester.While hooded and being held down, he stopped breathing and died a week later after being taken off life support.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Prude's death spurred weeks of protestsBut details of his death did not come to national attention until September 2020, when body camera footage of the arrest was released by the family after a public records request.The case led to the suspension of seven officers and the dismissal of the city's police chief.Mr Prude's family have filed a lawsuit, accusing the police department of trying to cover up the facts around his death.More on this story
