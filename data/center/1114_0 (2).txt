An emergency jobless-benefits program due to expire this weekend would pinch the finances of more than a million Americans, setting the stage for the what could become lawmakers' first flashpoint of the midterm election year.While the program's end would barely dent the broader economy, the money at stake is meaningful. The federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation, launched during the middle of the recession, pays on average $300 a week to 1.3 million long-term jobless who have exhausted the roughly 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits most states provide. If extended, the program would transfer about $25 billion in 2014 from the government to the unemployed, the Congressional Budget Office calculates.           
More           As soon as Congress returns from its holiday break, the Democratic-run Senate will consider a bipartisan measure to extend the program by three months. The interval is meant to give lawmakers time to work on a longer-term solution. But the extension isn't a slam-dunk as support in the GOP-controlled House remains unclear.      On Friday, President Barack Obama, in a push to extend the unemployment benefits, offered his support to the sponsors of the measure, Sens. Jack Reed (D., R.I.) and Dean Heller (R., Nev.), according to an administration official.                         Sheri Minkoff    is among those who would lose benefits. Ms. Minkoff, who is 50 years old and divorced, has been looking for work since being laid off from a Pittsburgh nonprofit group in January. In the past year, Ms. Minkoff's résumés "hit brick walls," she said, and she often later learned employers went with someone "about 20 years younger, with a master's degree, who will take a much smaller salary."      The government benefit she receives "pays my rent, it pays the electric, and that's all," said Ms. Minkoff, who has a 20-year-old son.                                                                                                                                                      On Capitol Hill, the issue of whether to extend the emergency program pits budget decisions against the wisdom of halting benefits when jobs are still hard to find. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) had said Republicans would back an extension only if spending cuts to cover the program were made elsewhere. Some moderate Republicans back an extension, but its passage through the House isn't assured.      Some opponents of continuing the program say the roughly $25 billion price tag would be more effective at rehabilitating the labor market if put toward creating jobs, rather than extending a safety net. Some analysts also describe the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program as a recession-era holdover no longer needed in an economy—and labor market—that has been recovering for more than four years.      "This is an emergency program," said Chris Edwards, of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. "The emergency has long been over."     "It is to an individual's advantage—as soon as they are unemployed—to really try to get employed again," Mr. Edwards said. "The curious thing about emergency unemployment benefits is that [they] induce people to wait to start searching for a job and that ends up kind of hurting them."     If the federal program isn't renewed, Mr. Edwards said he expects "a lot of people will make the tough decisions to take lower wages, change careers or jobs, or take a job that is less pleasant than they were hoping for."     Proponents of emergency unemployment insurance say the program not only helps recipients but also provides a lift to the economy as those benefits are spent.      Research has shown that such insurance may permit some job seekers to take more time in their searches, rather than accepting the first opportunity regardless of suitability. The benefits keep recipients—who are supposed to be looking for jobs in order to qualify—in the work force, rather than dropping out of it. Today's less-than-robust labor market—with almost three unemployed people for every opening—is particularly grim for the long-term unemployed.     "The problem we have right now is not a shortage of people who want jobs," said         Jesse Rothstein,    a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. "The problem we have is a shortage of jobs and that doesn't get better if you make people more desperate."      Without the money from the emergency unemployment benefits in consumers' hands, about 0.2 percentage point would be shaved off the 2%-to-2.5% gross domestic product growth that is forecast for the first quarter by IHS Global Insight.     The program's expiration has "a measurable impact in the first quarter," said Doug Handler, IHS's chief U.S. economist, "but not really a material impact unless you're part of the 1.3 million."     The key questions, Mr. Handler said, are about the people who will see their unemployment benefits stop: "How many will get jobs? How many will join the ranks of discouraged workers? How many will move back in with family members or relatives, or just move out to the streets?"     All told, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits has dropped, due in part to the gradually improving labor market. The rolls of beneficiaries also have declined because benefits have been exhausted or cut back. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for jobless benefits decreased by 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 338,000 in the week ended Dec. 21, a reading that is in line with the slow improvement seen in the labor market.     The ranks of the long-term unemployed include young and old workers, with a range of education. Among the beneficiaries in 2012, more than 50% had completed some college and 25.2% had earned a bachelor's degree or higher, according to a recent report by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, which favors renewing the program. Since the program began in 2008, about 40% of participants had annual household income before their job loss between $30,000 and $75,000, according to the report.     Arline Vezina, of Anaheim, Calif., has been counting on lawmakers in Washington to renew the program so her benefits won't get cut off. Since March, she has depended on unemployment insurance, after her job as a production manager at an advertising firm was eliminated. "The bottom line is," she said, "I have no income."     Ms. Vezina, 65, said she has tapped her professional network, signed up with recruiters and applied for jobs online—all to no avail. She began her advertising career right after college and now sees those decades of experience more as a handicap than an advantage.      "My skill-set is top of the line, but you're working with recruiters who…see 'X' amount of years on a résumé and you don't even get to the next level," she said.     Without unemployment insurance, Ms. Vezina doesn't see a way to stay in her home. "I'll have to sell my condominium," she said. "There is nothing else."     The long-term unemployed who face expiring payments are found in every state except North Carolina, which had its extended benefits cut off earlier this year after failing to meet federal guidelines. Since extended unemployment was eliminated in the state, its jobless rate has tumbled. But much of the decline is from people dropping out of the labor force.     After previous downturns, going back to the 1950s, the federal government has stepped in to help the jobless with benefits. The current Emergency Unemployment Compensation program has been renewed more than 10 times since July 2008. As the national labor picture has slowly improved, the combined state and federal benefits have been dialed back, from 99 weeks to 73 today. EUC benefits last between 14 and 47 weeks, depending on factors such as a state's unemployment rate.     States are preparing for the program's expiration. In Illinois, officials have reminded recipients with letters, email and website alerts, said Greg Rivara , a spokesman for the state's Department of Employment Security. The department has posted notices online about other assistance, such as health-care services, foreclosure-prevention information and food stamps.     The program could be renewed retroactively, as it has been during four of the past renewals since 2008. In recent years, the program has been renewed retroactively between two and 50 days after expiring.     For participants such as Ms. Minkoff, that would be only partial relief. "The problem with that is, I can't tell my landlord, 'I'll get you the money retroactively,' " she said. "You pay it by the first [of the month] or you're out."
