Rising tension between the U.S. and Iran eased at least temporarily on Friday after President         Trump    said he called off a planned military strike in order to spare Iranian lives, a development that opened the way for offers of diplomacy from other world leaders.Mr. Trump said he decided late Thursday to halt a military strike on Iran only 10 minutes before its scheduled start after he learned that it would kill 150 people. He said such an action would have been a disproportionate response to Iran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone that was flying over the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday. Meanwhile, Iran said Friday it also had taken steps to avoid American casualties in the operation, shooting down the spy plane but not firing on a manned U.S. aircraft flying nearby.     The U.S. military acknowledged Friday there was a P8 surveillance plane in the vicinity of where the drone was shot down, where it routinely flies missions “consistent with international law,” a military spokesman said in a statement.               The decisions in both Washington and Tehran pointed to the possibility of an unspoken agreement to avoid loss of life in the conflict over punitive U.S. sanctions, Iran’s nuclear program and other regional disputes. However, while both sides have said they don’t want war, neither acknowledged the existence of a tacit boundary.     “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General.”          Expanding on his decision in an NBC interview later Friday, Mr. Trump said: “I thought about it for a second, and I said, ‘You know what, they shot down an unmanned drone. And here we are sitting with 150 dead people.’…And I didn’t like it. I didn’t think it was proportionate.”     The Pentagon declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s assertion that the military response would have cost 150 lives.

Other world leaders seized on the momentary ease in tensions to call for talks.     “We must absolutely avoid escalation,” said French President         Emmanuel Macron    during a European Commission gathering in Brussels. “So I invite all the parties involved to reason, to de-escalation and now to discussion.”Mr. Macron said next week’s summit of officials from the Group of 20 leading nations in Japan offers a chance to “try to build some concrete diplomatic solutions to this situation, which can’t continue as it is because there is too much instability and tension.”     German Chancellor         Angela Merkel    told reporters that Berlin hoped for “a political solution of a very tense situation.” The U.S. requested a closed United Nations Security Council meeting Monday on the dispute.     Iran’s attack on the U.S. surveillance drone on Thursday had capped an expanding confrontation over the past week that also involved U.S. accusations that Iran had attacked six commercial ships with mines and was responsible for rockets fired at U.S. and Western targets throughout the region.     An administration official said Friday that the drone’s downing convinced Mr. Trump that Iran was mostly limiting its attacks to U.S. technology and wasn’t targeting troops, leading to his decision to call off the strike. That approach would represent a dramatic departure from intelligence reports in the past month that showed Iran considering a potential attack on U.S. forces in Iraq, the administration official said.     “The moment one American life is harmed, it will be met with an overwhelming response,” the official said.     The unmanned aircraft was downed by an Iranian surface-to-air missile battery, prompting a sharp disagreement between the two countries over whether the U.S. craft was in international airspace, beyond the 12-nautical-mile zone considered Iranian airspace. Iran says the drone was 8 nautical miles from its shoreline; the U.S. argues the aircraft was more than 18 nautical miles from land.     Mr. Trump repeatedly has shown caution on military matters, contrary to his reputation as a provocateur in domestic politics. He frequently has told aides that his administration must be willing to finish whatever military conflict it starts.                                                 General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Aerospace Force, displayed debris purportedly from a downed U.S. drone in Tehran Friday.

Last year, the president expressed certainty to his team that his decision then to launch missiles into Syria wouldn’t seriously escalate.     But he was less confident on Thursday night about that outcome with Iran, according to White House officials.     On Thursday, military options to strike Iranian assets were pushed by         John Bolton,    Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, these officials said. Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo,    while in favor of a strike, also was more understanding of reservations expressed by Defense Department officials, according to administration officials. Vice President      Mike Pence        supported those plans but also agreed with the president’s decision to abort them, the officials said.     “There was complete unanimity amongst the president’s advisers and DoD leadership on an appropriate response to Iran’s activities,” an administration official said. “The president made the final decision.”                In Washington,         Sen. Jim Risch    (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after attending a meeting Thursday at the White House that he expects the White House to follow through with another, nonmilitary, option for action.     “There’s going to be something more proportional, obviously. I suspect it’s going to be not-kinetic action,” he said, using a military term for nonmilitary action. “The Iranians made a mistake of meeting not-kinetic action with kinetic action, which is not proportional and is not appropriate.”     Sanctions are one such action. Mr. Trump said on Twitter that more sanctions had been imposed against Iran, though U.S. Treasury Department officials, responsible for implementing most of the administration’s sanctions, didn’t levy any new penalties. However, Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    said an international anti-money-laundering body meeting in Florida this past week agreed to require more stringent oversight by Iran of its banking industry.                                         Iranian forces shot down an American drone near the Strait of Hormuz, further escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran. WSJ's Gerald F.
