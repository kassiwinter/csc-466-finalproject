The health department’s politically-appointed communications aides have demanded the right to review and seek changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) weekly scientific reports on the status of the coronavirus pandemic, Politico reported Saturday. Emails reviewed by Politico and three people reportedly familiar with the situation indicated that communications aides openly complained in emails to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other senior officials that the agency’s reports would undermine President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves.
