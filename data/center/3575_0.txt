House conservatives Wednesday night took the first step toward removing Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein    from office, marking a dramatic escalation in a dispute over lawmakers’ requests for information about the government’s most politically charged probes.Reps.         Mark Meadows    (R., N.C.) and         Jim Jordan    (R., Ohio), along with nine co-sponsors, filed articles of impeachment against Mr. Rosenstein in the House. The move comes after a tense, monthslong tug of war over the Justice Department’s production of documents and information related to investigations involving         Hillary Clinton    and President Trump. Mr. Meadows and other congressional Republicans who are close allies of Mr. Trump say the push for more information is part of routine oversight of federal law enforcement. Democrats say it is an effort to undermine the current special counsel investigation that Mr. Rosenstein oversees.     The special counsel probe is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the probe a “witch hunt.”               Mr. Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement that the impeachment effort is “the result of nearly nine months of unsuccessful congressional attempts to force the Department of Justice to comply with oversight requests” and accused Mr. Rosenstein of “intentionally withholding embarrassing documents” and hiding information from Congress.     A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Meadows’s move. But earlier Wednesday, department officials said they had accommodated nearly all lawmakers’ requests for documents and other information related to the investigations. The officials said the requests from several Republicans were unusual and possibly unprecedented, given that information from sensitive investigations generally is closely held, to avoid compromising the probe or endangering people involved.     The impeachment articles were filed after Freedom Caucus members met Wednesday with top Justice Department officials to discuss the status of their requests.          Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the articles of impeachment “were filed in bad faith and show extraordinary lengths to which House Republicans will go to protect Trump.”     The impeachment resolution accuses Mr. Rosenstein of having conflicts of interest regarding ongoing Justice Department investigations, ordering allegedly improper surveillance of Trump campaign associate         Carter Page    during the 2016 campaign, defying a congressional subpoena for documents and attempting to conceal certain facts from Congress.     Mr. Meadow’s push to impeach Mr. Rosenstein is unlikely to succeed in removing him from office. He would need to win support of a majority of his colleagues in the House and then win a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Democrats and many Republicans are unlikely to support impeaching Mr. Rosenstein.     The lawmakers issued subpoenas seeking such information as the secret surveillance warrants investigators obtained to monitor Mr. Page; thousands of pages related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s handling of the Clinton email investigation; and sensitive information about a confidential informant in the Russia probe.      The Justice Department officials said they had gone to great lengths to accommodate the requests. They created two reading rooms—one for the Clinton probe and one for the Russia inquiry—at department headquarters where lawmakers and their staffs could view documents, in an effort to speed the process. The FBI created a special software program to search its confidential database in response to some of the requests, officials said.                                         Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges Friday against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking the 2016 presidential election. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

But they were able to work with members of Congress to narrow their queries, so they could respond to the requests without compromising the cases.     A few outstanding requests will be accommodated in the next week, the officials said.     The only document the Justice Department has refused to provide was a memo from Mr. Rosenstein to special counsel         Robert Mueller    outlining the scope of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Officials say it contains information about subjects and targets and would compromise the continuing investigation.     The Republican lawmakers filed the impeachment resolution under normal parliamentary rules—meaning that it will be sent to the Judiciary Committee for debate and consideration before it can be advanced to the full House. However, Mr. Meadows and his allies could use a parliamentary maneuver to force a vote in the full House in the future if the committee doesn’t advance the measure.      The Constitution specifies that federal officials can be impeached for “high crimes and misdemeanors” but doesn’t define those terms. No executive branch official has ever been successfully removed from office through impeachment. In 1876, the House successfully impeached Secretary of War William Belknap but he was acquitted in the Senate. Two presidents—         Bill Clinton    and         Andrew Johnson    —have been impeached in the House but avoided conviction in the Senate. All other successful impeachments and removals have been of federal judges.
