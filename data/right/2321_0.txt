                                                                                                                                         President Obama said Thursday that Republican Donald Trump has “rattled” world leaders by showing an “ignorance” of foreign affairs.                                                                                                                                                      Speaking to reporters at a summit in Japan, Mr. Obama said foreign leaders are surprised by Mr. Trump and unsure whether to take his comments about world affairs seriously.                                                                                                                                                      “They are paying very close attention to this election,” the president said. “I think it’s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements. But they’re rattled by them, and for good reason.”                                                                                                                                                                    Many of Mr. Trump’s proposals, Mr. Obama said, “display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous and what is required to keep the world on an even keel.”                                                                                                                   The president downplayed Democratic concerns about the unfinished primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying sometimes in a primary people get “grumpy.”
