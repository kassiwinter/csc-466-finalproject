President Donald Trump is expected to seek Moscow’s help in scaling back Iran’s military presence in Syria when he meets in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 16 for a summit, say European diplomats and U.S. officials.Some American officials see a potential for a U.S. and Russian “convergence” on the issue that Mr. Trump could explore at the summit meeting, said one senior diplomat, one of several who have recently spoken to American officials on the issue. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo underscored the administration’s concerns about Iran’s presence in Syria in an appearance before Congress on Wednesday.     “If the Russians could get the Iranians out of there, I would applaud it,” said Mr. Pompeo, who added that Moscow’s ability to accomplish that was “an open-ended question.”               Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who is close to Mr. Trump, said in an interview that some ranking U.S. officials appear attracted to the idea, calling it “a projection of where I think they are headed.”     He added: “The Israelis have been pushing this idea of getting the Russians to push Iran out.”     The Iranian military presence has become a major worry for Israel, a close U.S. ally, which has launched repeated airstrikes against Iranian positions in Syria. But the Syrian opposition worries that a potential U.S.-Russian deal would end up strengthening Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s hold on power.      A spokesman for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s summit strategy, including any possible initiatives on Syria, saying only that “the president hopes that it will lead to constructive engagement that improves peace and security around the world.”     The summit meeting is expected to deal with an broad array of issues, including Syria, the role of Russia-backed forces in Eastern Ukraine and arms control. Administration officials have been playing down the idea that the summit will result in tangible “deliverables.”     The Helsinki summit will come several days after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels. The last such juxtaposition of presidential meetings with allies and a long-standing adversary was jarring.      Allied nations are still smarting from the acrimonious trade disputes that emerged earlier this month with Mr. Trump at the Group of Seven leading nations summit. That was quickly followed by a warm summit meeting in Singapore between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.     If a contentious NATO meeting is also followed by a positive meeting between Messrs. Trump and Putin, that could open up opportunities for the Kremlin to exploit fissures within the Western alliance, some officials worry.     “The administration has been doing damage control and saying ‘Don’t worry, we will be extremely firm,’” one European official said of the coming Helsinki summit. “But again, we don’t know.”     John Bolton, the White House national security adviser who secured the summit meeting with Mr. Putin, stopped in London and Rome to meet allied officials before traveling to Moscow earlier this week.                                         National Security Advisor John Bolton will travel to Moscow later this week to discuss the possibility of a summit meeting with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But what would the two leaders discuss? The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib explains.

One scenario supported by some in the State Department is to seek Moscow’s help in pushing the Iranians and the Shiite militias they support out of a strip of territory in southwest Syria that abuts Jordan and Israel.     Russia and State Department officials agreed on a tentative proposal that would have kept the Iranian forces at least 27 miles from the border, say people familiar with early negotiations.     In return, the Russians are asking the U.S. to close the military base it has maintained at al-Tanf, which U.S. and other allied forces use to support local Syrian fighters, near the intersection of the Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi border, U.S. officials say.     Russia has violated a ceasefire pact for southwest Syria in recent days by carrying out airstrikes to support a Syrian government offensive against opposition groups in the area.     But the tentative proposal was rebuffed by the White House and Mr. Bolton, who is looking for a more expansive agreement to expel Iran’s fighters from all of Syria and curb its influence across the country, people familiar with the discussions said.     The U.S. base at al-Tanf is situated in the middle of a route Iran that would like to use to shuttle weapons and manpower to Hezbollah allies in Lebanon. And shutting the base would remove a key American obstacle to Iran’s ambitions.      While Russia’s intentions aren’t entirely clear, some American officials believe they are trying to pressure the U.S., Jordan and Israel to agree to a new accommodation that would allow the Assad government to reassert its authority in the border area with Israel and Jordan.     Reflecting mounting concern over the region, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, plans to meet with senior Israeli military officials in Washington this week, U.S. officials say.        
Read More        A grander version of the administration’s Russia policy could seek the Kremlin’s help in getting Iranian forces out of Syria altogether, or at least diminishing their role, in return for Washington’s acceptance of Russia’s role in the country and perhaps even Mr. Assad’s continued rule, the European diplomats said.     Advocates for the approach said that the U.S. has limited leverage in Syria, the Russians have some sway over Mr. Assad and Iran’s presence there has emerged as one of the Trump administration top security concerns in the region. Mr. Trump already has cut off covert aid to Syrian opposition groups and has declared his interest in eventually withdrawing the 2,200 U.S. troops from eastern Syria.     Skeptics argue that Mr. Assad is heavily dependent on Iranian forces to take back territory from the opposition in the conflict and that no amount of Russian pressure could lead him to evict them.     “The regime won the civil war with the Iranian’s training and support and that is not a fact that is going to change anytime soon,” said one expert on the region.     Mr. Graham is also among the skeptics, asserting that Russian officials won’t be inclined to foster a lasting political settlement in Syria until they have endured more casualties.     “There will come a day when we can have a serious conversations with the Russians about settling the problems in Syria,” Mr. Graham said. “We are nowhere near that. They are dominating Syria at low cost.”     Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Trump believes that it is vital for Russia to be part of “important geostrategic conversations” and was sober-minded about Mr. Putin’s intentions.     “The president is looking forward to an opportunity to find those handful of places where we can have productive conversations that lead to improvements for each of our two countries,” Mr. Pompeo said.      —Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.
