      	Pennsylvania voters shouldn’t look forward to election results anytime soon, with even an unofficial tally for the swing state likely off the table until Friday, according to local election officials.
Due to a crush of mail-in ballots — which, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling, can be counted up to three days after Election Day — the fate of the state’s potentially crucial 20 electoral votes will remain up in the air for some time.
Because mail-in voters predominantly skew Democratic, early returns could potentially give false hope to President Trump’s re-election bid.
“Remember, [Democrat Joe] Biden supporters are disproportionately voting by mail,” tweeted Politico reporter Holly Otterbein late Tuesday, noting that Philadelphia vote counters called it a night after tallying only 76,000 of the city’s 350,000 absentee ballots.
Further complicating matters, a Pennsylvania court has agreed to a Wednesday hearing on a Republican push to invalidate mail-in ballots over corrected errors, according to a tweet from John Kruzel, a reporter for The Hill.
Keystone State voters will likely have the longest wait, but not the only one.
Election officials in Wisconsin, which holds 10 electoral votes, have said that the count in Milwaukee County likely won’t finish until around 6 a.m. Wednesday, with an unofficial state count to follow later in the day.
Michigan and its 16 electoral votes too are expected to remain on ice until late Wednesday, according to local election officials.
