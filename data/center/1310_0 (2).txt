WASHINGTON—Central Intelligence Agency officers snooped on computers used by a Senate committee investigating the CIA's interrogation program, an internal agency report has concluded—a critical finding in a bitter standoff between two government branches.CIA Director         John Brennan    apologized to key senators, who were briefed this week on the CIA inspector general's report, the agency said on Thursday. The finding bolsters allegations by Sen.         Dianne Feinstein    (D., Calif.), the Senate intelligence committee chairwoman, who has denounced what she described as a CIA search of Senate computers that may have violated the Constitution's separation of powers and Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.     Sen. Mark Udall (D., Colo.), a member of the intelligence panel, on Thursday called for Mr. Brennan's resignation after a briefing on the report. "CIA unconstitutionally spied on Congress," he said. "These offenses, along with other errors in judgment by some at the CIA, demonstrate a tremendous failure of leadership, and there must be consequences."               The CIA declined to comment on Mr. Udall's call for Mr. Brennan's resignation.     The CIA has also alleged that Senate staffers improperly accessed an agency document, and the Senate sergeant-at-arms is still probing the staffers' actions on the committee, formally known as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.     CIA Inspector General         David Buckley    briefed Ms. Feinstein and the committee vice chairman, Sen.         Saxby Chambliss    (R., Ga.), on Tuesday. Ms. Feinstein called Mr. Brennan's apology and the formation of an accountability board "positive first steps."

Previously.           The computer dispute soured relations between the CIA and Congress, which have become more fraught than at any point in the past decade, particularly after Mr. Brennan's initial approach to push back at the allegations earlier this year.     The new report could transform the agency's relationship with Congress and reshape Mr. Brennan's legacy at the CIA.     The report found that "some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding" between the agency and the committee concerning access to RDINet, a network the CIA set up for the Senate panel to obtain agency documents for its investigation of the interrogation program, said CIA spokesman         Dean Boyd.         RDI is short for rendition, detention and interrogation. Rendition is the practice of sending detainees to a third country for interrogation.     Five CIA employees, two attorneys and three information-technology staff members "improperly accessed or caused access" to the special network, according to a declassified summary reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Those efforts included falsifying identities to get on the Senate network, reading emails and taking screenshots, said an official who read the inspector general's report.     Mr. Brennan set up the accountability board to further look into the matter, Mr. Boyd said. Former Sen. Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat and a member of the CIA's external review panel, will head it. Recommendations could include disciplinary measures for employees and steps to address "systemic issues," Mr. Boyd said.     The computer-snooping controversy was the latest battle between the committee and the agency over the committee's investigation of the CIA interrogation program, which President Barack Obama shut down in 2009. The report is expected to be critical of the CIA's harsh interrogation practices in the years following Sept. 11, 2001.                                                                                                                                Tensions between the Senate and CIA over that still-classified report had been brewing since June 2013, when Mr. Brennan rebutted many of its findings. A point of contention, according to congressional officials, is the report's finding that the program didn't produce vital intelligence, which the CIA strongly disputes.     The computer controversy dates to November, when the Senate committee asked the CIA for an internal agency report that tracked the Senate investigation, according to the CIA. CIA officials suspected the committee already had the report.     In January, the CIA reviewed Senate computer usage and found evidence suggesting several committee aides may have improperly obtained the document. "They thought they could go on [the network], because it was a CIA system and they were on solid legal ground," said a person familiar with the matter.     Mr. Brennan presented those agency findings to Sens. Feinstein and Chambliss at a Jan. 15 meeting, telling them he had directed CIA information-technology staffers to "begin a full computer security review." Two days later, Sen. Feinstein asked Mr. Brennan to go no further, and Mr. Brennan suspended any further review.     Mr. Brennan asked the CIA inspector general to investigate whether the CIA acted improperly. The Justice Department began to review whether either the CIA or Senate staff had acted improperly.     The CIA-Senate battle spilled into public, and Sen. Feinstein in March gave an unusual floor speech condemning what she called "the CIA's intrusion and search" of committee computers. She demanded an apology.     Mr. Brennan, asked about Ms. Feinstein's floor speech that day, played down the CIA's actions. "A lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong," he said.     White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday said the admission that CIA officers had improperly accessed Senate computers didn't amount to a credibility problem for Mr. Brennan. "Director Brennan has done what is necessary to get to the bottom of what exactly happened," he calling it "proactive leadership that the president would expect."     The Justice Department said in early July that there was no reason to open a criminal investigation on either side. The Senate sergeant-at-arms investigation is the final remaining probe of the computer-search issues.     Even though Mr. Brennan has directed in mid-January that further investigation of Senate computers be halted, the CIA's Office of Security was unaware of the order and conducted an investigation of committee activities on that network. The investigation included a keyword search of all of the emails of Democratic aides on the special system and a review of some of their emails, according to the summary of the report.      Three CIA information technology employees "demonstrated a lack of candor about their activities" in interviews with the inspector general's office, the summary concluded.     A crimes report filed by the CIA with the Justice Department alleging Senate aides had improperly accessed a CIA document turned out to be based on "inaccurate information," the inspector general found.
