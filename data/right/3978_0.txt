                                                                                                                                         Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer begged Republicans Friday to break with President Trump and vote to reopen the government without new border wall money, saying the president doesn’t know how to negotiate.                                                                                                                                                      The shot came just minutes before Democratic leaders were to be at the White House to meet with Mr. Trump — and it was a cut at the president’s own self-image as a masterful deal-maker.                                                                                                                                                      “President Trump is a terrible negotiator,” Mr. Schumer said.                                                                                                                                                                    The government shutdown reached two weeks Friday, and there’s little sign it will end soon.                                                                                                                              Senators aren’t holding votes Friday and are expected to be out of session over the weekend and Monday. When they return Tuesday night, they have other business in front of them.                                                                                                                                                       The House late Thursday passed two bills to reopen nine departments that lost funding Dec. 22, but Mr. Trump has signaled he would veto them, and Senate Republican leaders have said they won’t give the bills floor time.
