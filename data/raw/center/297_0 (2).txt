WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court upheld a pair of Arizona voting rules against Democratic claims that the state discriminated against minority voters, a decision that could make it more difficult to challenge new state efforts to tighten election regulations. The court, in a 6-3 opinion by Justice         Samuel Alito,    ruled Arizona was on solid legal ground in enforcing rules that prohibit third parties from collecting mail-in ballots and disallow votes cast in the wrong precinct.        
Read the Opinion        The decision, issued on the final day before the court’s summer recess, was one of two major rulings that divided the court along ideological lines, with conservatives in the majority. The court also struck down a California requirement that tax-exempt charities disclose their major donors to state regulators.      Justice Alito said that while Arizona “generally makes it very easy to vote,” the process of voting entails some level of burden for everyone. “Mere inconvenience” for voters isn’t enough to establish that election regulations violate the law, Justice Alito wrote.           He said the existence of some disparity in how an election regulation affects different racial and ethnic groups “does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.”      The alleged racial disparity caused by Arizona’s out-of-precinct rule was small, the court said, and requiring a voter “to identify one’s own polling place and then travel there to vote does not exceed the usual burdens of voting.” The court also said the ballot-collection ban was reasonable, and there was no concrete evidence that it was discriminatory.          “Limiting the classes of persons who may handle early ballots to those less likely to have ulterior motives deters potential fraud and improves voter confidence,” Justice Alito wrote.     A number of states have rules similar to Arizona’s but Democrats argued historical and societal factors in that state made the measures discriminatory against the state’s Native American, Latino and Black voters. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in a divided ruling last year, saying the regulations needed to be viewed in light of the state’s “long and unhappy history of official discrimination connected to voting.” That court also said Arizona adopted the ballot-collection ban with discriminatory intent.     The Supreme Court overturned that decision.     Joining Justice Alito were the court’s five other conservatives: Chief Justice         John Roberts    and Justices         Clarence Thomas,         Neil Gorsuch,         Brett Kavanaugh    and Amy Coney Barrett.     In dissent, the court’s liberals accused the majority of crippling a landmark law intended to further democratic principles that historically hadn’t been applied equally.      “What is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten—in order to weaken—a statute that stands as a monument to America’s greatness, and protects against its basest impulses,” Justice         Elena Kagan    wrote, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and         Sonia Sotomayor.         “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is an extraordinary law. Rarely has a statute required so much sacrifice to ensure its passage. Never has a statute done more to advance the Nation’s highest ideals. And few laws are more vital in the current moment,” she wrote. “Yet in the last decade, this Court has treated no statute worse,” she wrote. Justice Kagan linked Thursday’s decision to Shelby County v. Holder, a 2013 ruling that effectively eliminated requirements that states which historically discriminated against minority voters obtain federal clearance before changing election practices.

Justice Kagan said Congress was intent on eradicating “the subtle, as well as the obvious, ways of suppressing minority voting,” and said the court’s ruling would make it easier for states to save such schemes. Arizona, she said, threw out more out-of-precinct ballots than any state in the nation, disproportionately affecting minorities. And the ballot-collection ban harmed Native Americans who had to travel far distances to use the mail, she said.     The case featured a head-to-head legal fight between the Democrats and Republicans. The Democratic National Committee and affiliated groups sued the state; Arizona Republican Attorney General         Mark Brnovich    and the state Republican Party defended the rules as neutral and reasonable measures for running a fair and secure election.     “The Supreme Court ruling sets out a clear test that allows states to adopt common-sense election-integrity measures,” Mr. Brnovich said.     “In Arizona and across the nation, states know best how to manage their own elections,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman         Ronna McDaniel    said.     Republican-led states around the U.S. are pushing for new voting regulations after Democrats won the White House and Senate during a pandemic year in which some election officials eased methods of casting ballots. Thursday’s ruling could boost those efforts by making legal challenges against voting restrictions tougher to win.     Among those challenges is the suit the U.S. brought last week against Georgia, alleging the state’s new voting law aims to restrict the rights of Black voters. That lawsuit came on the heels of other new lawsuits filed around the country by voting-rights advocates.      The ruling drew criticism from voting-rights groups and Democrats who said the court’s reasoning would embolden GOP efforts to make it harder for certain people to vote.     Supreme Court     “In a span of just eight years, the court has now done severe damage to two of the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965—a law that took years of struggle and strife to secure,” President         Biden    said in a statement. “After all we have been through to deliver the promise of this Nation to all Americans, we should be fully enforcing voting rights laws, not weakening them.”     The Justice Department under the Trump administration supported Arizona in the case. After Mr. Biden took office, his administration chose not to argue against the state’s regulations, but it told the court that it disagreed with the prior administration’s narrower view on voting rights.     The department on Thursday said it remained “strongly committed to challenging discriminatory election laws” and urged Congress to enact legislation to provide more robust protection for voters.     Senate Republicans in June blocked Democrats from moving ahead with broad elections legislation. House Democrats are now working on an updated version of the         John Lewis    Voting Rights Advancement Act, named for the late Georgia congressman and civil-rights leader whose 1965 beating by Alabama troopers helped spur passage of the original Voting Rights Act.      The Arizona case had been closely watched because it gave the Supreme Court an opportunity to interpret a key provision of the Voting Rights Act—known as Section 2—that prohibits states from imposing any rule “which results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote on the basis of race.     House Judiciary Committee Chairman         Jerrold Nadler    (D., N.Y.) and         Rep. Steve Cohen    (D., Tenn.), chairman of a civil-rights subcommittee, said the decision weakens Section 2 and “elevates the argument that states’ interests in preventing voter fraud–even when there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud–outweigh the burdens these policies place on the ability of minority communities to cast a vote.”     Not so, said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). “Section 2 remains a strong and crucial safeguard against racial discrimination, but the court was right to reject its attempted use by activists to eliminate common-sense voting laws,“ he said. While voter protections remain, he added, “states are rightly empowered to administer and protect America’s elections.”     Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin+1@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
