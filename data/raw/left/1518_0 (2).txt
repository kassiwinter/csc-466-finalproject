But on Tuesday, she suffered the biggest indignity of her 2014 campaign, and possibly of her political career.Landrieu, reduced to a relatively pointless gambit to demonstrate her clout in Washington, failed to secure the 60 votes required to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. She came up one vote shy.This was basically Landrieu's final play. With no party funding for her campaign, she has been drubbed on the airwaves -- as in, exponentially so. And even before that, few gave her much hope in her runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).So in a last-ditch effort to move the needle, she launched the Keystone campaign. Nevermind that the very same bill will probably pass with ease once Republicans take control of the Senate in January. She wanted to prove she could make it happen two months earlier -- because why not.And Senate Democrats -- who, again, have abandoned her financially -- have now abandoned her in spirit too. The vote wasn't just meaningless because Republicans will pass the bill come next year; it was also meaningless because the White House has basically said it would veto the bill, as the State Department is still reviewing the project.And despite all of it -- despite the whole dog-and-pony show of the past week -- Democrats couldn't even give Landrieu enough votes to breathe a little life (hypothetically, at least) into her long-shot campaign.On Tuesday, with Landrieu's assistance, they metaphorically ran over the body with a truck.And Landrieu, a three-term senator and member of a royal political family from Louisiana, just proved precisely how little clout -- or hope -- she has.
