Fauci said "it won't be very long" for the CDC to potentially adjust official guidelines on social distancing policies, if the data suggests 3 feet of distance won't negatively affect people's safety.Driving the news: A new study on Massachusetts public schools by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) found "no substantial difference" in the number of cases in school districts that implemented a 3-foot distancing policy among students versus a 6-foot policy.According to Fauci, the CDC is launching their own study. "When the data shows that there is an ability to be 3 feet, they will act accordingly."Fauci added, "I talk to the CDC, to Dr. Walensky every single day. She is acutely aware of the accumulation of data and the fact that her team will be acting on the data the way they always do."
