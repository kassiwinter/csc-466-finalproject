       Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that Democrats could reach a deal on the framework of their spending package this week.       Manchin has for weeks been a thorn in the side of liberals seeking a proposed $3.5 trillion spending package. Manchin, as well as Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, have raised objections to the size and scope of the package, with Manchin pushing for a $1.5 trillion deal.             JAMES CARVILLE: ‘I HATE GUYS LIKE GLENN YOUNGKIN’       The West Virginia Democrat told reporters he’s “still at $1.5 trillion” but believes a deal on a conceptual framework could be reached this week, citing “good faith” discussions between Democrats.       Manchin also said he pushed back on a Medicaid expansion under consideration in the package. Politico reported Monday that Manchin objected to a plan to expand Medicaid coverage in red states and swing states that did not elect to expand this coverage for low-income people. West Virginia did expand its Medicaid program several years ago.

With just 50 Democratic senators and no Republican support, Democrats would need Vice President Kamala Harris's tiebreaking vote to send the package, which contains key portions of President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, to his desk. The party has thus far failed to reach a deal among its centrist and liberal members ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline.       Agreement on the spending measure is also crucial to unlocking a Senate-passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that has yet to come before the House. Far-left House Democrats say that level of spending is insufficient and won't back it until the larger spending bill is written.
