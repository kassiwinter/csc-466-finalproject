CBS Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive         Leslie Moonves    is stepping down amid accusations that he sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women over his career, the company said, a stunning downfall for one of the entertainment industry’s most powerful figures.CBS also announced a settlement of outstanding legal disputes with its controlling shareholder, National Amusements Inc., which will replace six members of CBS’s board. The size of Mr. Moonves’s exit package will be decided only after the law firms CBS’s board hired to investigate his alleged misconduct complete their work, the company said.     If Mr. Moonves is cleared of wrongdoing, he could walk away with more than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. But if he is found to have engaged in serious misconduct, he would walk away with nothing, several people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Moonves and CBS agreed to immediately donate $20 million to “organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace,” the company said in a statement. That amount would be deducted from any severance that Mr. Moonves would get.          The law firms tapped by CBS are investigating assault and harassment accusations against Mr. Moonves that surfaced in a New Yorker article in July. The New Yorker published on Sunday another article detailing new allegations from six more women, including that Mr. Moonves forced some to perform oral sex, engaged in other violent and intimidating behavior and retaliated against them when rebuffed.     In response to the latest claims, Mr. Moonves acknowledged to the New Yorker three of the six alleged encounters but said they were consensual. Previously, he has said he regretted behavior that made women uncomfortable but denied retaliating against those who pushed him away.

Earlier, the company said in a statement: “CBS takes these allegations very seriously. Our Board of Directors is conducting a thorough investigation of these matters, which is ongoing.”     The settlement with National Amusements also comes with a significant shake-up of the CBS board: Six new members, including veteran media executive Dick Parsons, have been elected, the companies said. Other new board members include         Candace Beinecke,    a corporate governance expert and senior partner of Hughes Hubbard & Reed;         Barbara Byrne,    former vice chairman of Barclays Investment Bank; Brian Goldner, the chief executive of Hasbro Inc.; Susan Schuman, the chief executive of SYPartners, a business transformation consultancy; and         Strauss Zelnick,    chief executive of “Grand Theft Auto” maker         Take-Two Interactive Software    and former chief executive of BMG Music Entertainment.     Beyond Mr. Moonves, six members of CBS’s board will depart, including         David Andelman,    a longtime lawyer of National Amusements’ controlling Redstone family;         Charles Gifford,    who clashed with National Amusements President Shari Redstone in the past; longtime CBS directors Arnold Kopelson and         Leonard Goldberg,    both close friends of 95-year-old Sumner Redstone, the ailing National Amusements chairman; former Sony Music Entertainment chief         Doug Morris    ; and         Joseph Califano Jr.    , the founder of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse.     Mr. Andelman’s departure reduces the number of directors associated with National Amusements from three to two, including Shari Redstone and         Rob Klieger,    a lawyer who has represented the Redstone family.     Mr. Moonves’s ouster brings an abrupt end to a storied Hollywood career. The 68-year-old rose through the ranks of the TV production business before coming to CBS in 1995 and eventually taking the CEO job in 2006. He led a turnaround of CBS’s prime-time schedule with series such as “Everybody Loves Raymond, “The Big Bang Theory” and the “CSI” franchise.     The CBS chief also becomes the most prominent and powerful entertainment executive to be forced from his job as the #MeToo movement brings men to account for misbehavior across corporate America. His case has played out differently than some other prominent ones, where allegations or revelations led to an executive’s swift departure; in the case of Mr. Moonves, in the weeks since the New Yorker’s initial report the company’s stance had been that it would conduct its probe and wait.

Under the terms of Mr. Moonves’s contract, he would be entitled to severance of more than $180 million in salary and bonus awards if he were terminated either “without cause” or with “good reason.”      Several of the women who came forward in the latest report were outraged by recent news reports that Mr. Moonves might walk away with a big severance payout, according to the New Yorker.     Chief Operating Officer         Joe Ianniello    was named interim chief executive of CBS while a search is conducted inside and outside the company for a successor.     The corporate fight over control, which was separate from issues surrounding Mr. Moonves’s personal conduct, centered on CBS’s resistance to Ms. Redstone’s effort to merge the company with         Viacom Inc.,    the media conglomerate that the Redstones also control.     Ms. Redstone will emerge from a settlement having maintained control of her media empire while ensuring the CBS board will get fresh blood, as she sought. She also managed to avoid a trial likely to raise uncomfortable questions about the mental capacity of her father, Sumner Redstone, and her legitimacy at the helm of the empire. Mr. Redstone has 80% of the voting shares of National Amusements; Ms. Redstone has the rest.     As part of the legal detente, CBS ended its efforts to dilute National Amusements’ voting control of the company to around 20%. National Amusements amended its bylaws to block a dividend that would have diluted its influence, and the two sides were gearing up for a legal battle in Delaware scheduled to start next month.     As part of the settlement, National Amusements has agreed to undo that amendment.     National Amusements also agreed it wouldn’t pursue a merger between CBS and Viacom for roughly two years, the companies said.     National Amusements further agreed it would amend the trust that will control CBS and Viacom after Mr. Redstone dies or is deemed incapacitated, according to people familiar with the matter.     The trust prohibits the trustees from proceeding with any merger that leaves National Amusements with less than 30% of the voting control of the resulting business. Much of the CBS board views it as an impediment to potential deals and potential drag on the stock.
