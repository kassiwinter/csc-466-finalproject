U.S. employers added jobs in October at the quickest pace this year, while boosting wages at the fastest rate since 2009, giving the Federal Reserve its clearest signal yet that the economy may be strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase next month.Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday. Revisions showed employers added a combined 12,000 more jobs in September and August than previously estimated, bringing the year’s monthly average to 206,000. The unemployment rate fell to 5%, a level Fed officials expected it to reach by year’s end and near the 4.9% rate they project as normal in the long run.                                         A strong October jobs report is likely to give Federal Reserve officials assurance as they weigh an interest rate rise before year's end. WSJ Ahead of the Tape columnist Steven Russolillo discusses the economic picture and what's next for the Fed.                                                                                                     Average hourly earnings of private-sector workers rose at a 2.5% annual pace in October. That marked the best year-over-year performance since July 2009, just as the economy was emerging from recession, and a notable rise from the 2% average pace during the six-year economic expansion.     The upbeat report eased fears that market turmoil and slowing growth in China and Europe were crimping the U.S. economy.                                          The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at near zero since the 2008 financial crisis. To raise them, it has come up with a new set of tools. Produced by Katy Burne, Christopher Kaeser, Arielle Ray and Mark Scheffler.                                                                                                     Economists and investors interpreted the news, particularly the signs of wage growth, as raising the likelihood that, barring some surprise in coming weeks, Fed officials would feel more comfortable about increasing short-term interest rates when they hold their next policy meeting in mid-December.                Fed officials have said for months they would start lifting their benchmark rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, after they saw more improvement in the labor market and felt “reasonably confident” annual inflation would rise toward their 2% target.        
More Jobs Coverage        “This is the kind of employment report that even the most diehard doves on the [Fed] cannot ignore,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Employers have had the upper hand since the crisis, and that’s starting to swing a little bit. Workers are starting to get more leverage. Firms have a lot of job openings and they’re having trouble filling them.”     In financial markets, investors began adjusting to the possibility of a December rate increase.      The probability of a hike rose to about 70% Friday from 58% a day earlier, based on trading in fed-funds futures tracked by         CME Group.         The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.90 points to 17910.33, boosted by bank stocks. The dollar gained sharply against the euro and the yen. Yields on Treasurys rose, with the rate-sensitive two-year note at 0.889%, the highest close since May 2010.      Should the central bank raise rates in December, the focus would then shift to a subject that Fed officials have said is even more important: the pace of tightening.           The central bank’s message, reinforced this past week by Chairwoman         Janet Yellen    and other officials, is that rates will likely be raised gradually as the Fed watches for confirmation that inflation is rising.      Policy makers have “unanimous” support for a gradual pace of rate increases once the process starts, St. Louis Fed President         James Bullard    said Friday. He added that the first move will be followed by a “healthy debate” about subsequent steps. The Fed’s next policy meetings after December are scheduled for the end of January and mid-March, giving policy makers a chance to survey the landscape as the new year gets under way.     The Fed, at one point moving toward a rate increase as early as September, held back due to worries including a strong dollar and weak growth in major overseas economies.     Many of the hires in October were in domestically oriented service sectors that are largely immune to overseas turbulence, including retail, food services, health care and construction.      Some of the latest hiring could reflect retailers getting an early jump on what they expect to be a strong holiday season. Retail jobs rose by 44,000 in October, and major retail chains like         Macy’s    and Target are offering more hours and higher pay to attract workers for the holidays. Even for nonsupervisory workers in the retail sector, average hourly pay rose 2.7% over the past year to $14.90 an hour, outpacing the overall annual wage growth.                                                                                                                                                     In another sign of the labor market’s gathering strength: A broad measure of unemployment that includes Americans stuck in part-time jobs or too discouraged to look for work fell to 9.8% in October, the lowest level since May 2008. This was largely due to a sharp drop in the number of involuntary part-time workers. About 269,000 fewer people described themselves as working “part-time for economic reasons” in October than September.     Still, despite the strong overall labor-market reading, some signs of slack linger. In October, 7.9 million workers who wanted a job couldn’t find one, a relatively elevated level six years after the expansion began.                                                                                                                                                     And some segments of the job market have shown distress from the overseas tumult, with steep losses in the mining and other export-oriented sectors. The mining and logging sector shed 4,000 jobs in October to bring its total losses this year to 108,000.      Cotta Transmission Co., a Beloit, Wis., firm that makes mining, drilling and industrial equipment for multinational firms including         Caterpillar Inc.,    cut about 20 of its 90 employees this year as orders fell.     Chief Executive Wayne Hanna said he’s hoping to maintain headcount by cutting hours, boosting productivity and raising his firm’s flexibility by training workers to operate a variety of machines. “I’m not sure that mining has hit bottom yet,” he said. “The commodities business is more world-economy dependent.”     At the higher-skilled end of the labor market,         Raanan Horowitz    has been raising pay to better compete for engineering talent at Elbit Systems of America LLC, a defense electronics company. In the past year, the Fort Worth, Texas, company has doubled the engineering staff at its medical-equipment division to 120, bringing total employment in that division to 250. “There’s definitely strong competition for the skilled, technical workforce, so we’ve had to adjust some of our expectations on pay and stuff in order to be competitive,” said Mr. Horowitz, the company’s chief executive.     —Ben Leubsdorf      and Michael S.
