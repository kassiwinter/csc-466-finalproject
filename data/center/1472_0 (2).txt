Republicans remain in a favorable position heading into the midterm election, but the outlook is unsettled amid unusually low voter interest, high dissatisfaction with leaders in Washington and a reordering of issues on voters’ minds, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.          Voters’ excitement about the campaign hasn’t increased as Election Day approaches, defying the trend in recent years. The share of voters who see the country on the wrong track has reached the highest level ever in a midterm-election year. And an election that once was thought to hinge on health care and other domestic issues is increasingly shadowed by international crises that weren’t on the radar just a few months ago.                                                                                                                                      Pollsters for both parties who conducted the survey predict Republican gains in the House and Senate, as the poll found that likely voters prefer a GOP-controlled Congress over a Democratic one, 46% to 44%. But they also said the unusually volatile environment, combined with the large number of close races for control of the Senate and governors’ offices, raised the potential for unexpected results.     “Something weird will happen on election night,” predicted         Bill McInturff,    the Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. “When you are sitting on top of an unstable, ticked-off electorate, there is a joker in the deck that ought to give us a little bit of caution.”               The slight preference for a GOP Congress comes amid continued low job-approval ratings for President         Barack Obama,    including a record-low 31% approval for his handling of foreign policy among registered voters, with 61% disapproving.     But the GOP advantage is narrower than the 50%-to-43% edge the Republicans enjoyed at this point before the 2010 wave that gave them a majority in the House. The poll finds that half of all voters have negative impressions of the GOP—a level substantially higher than in September and close to the record registered during last fall’s government shutdown.     One of the wild cards in the final weeks of the midterm campaign is the rise of foreign affairs as an issue on voters’ minds. The fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria ranked third among issues that voters said would be important in their vote for Congress, beyond job creation and breaking the partisan gridlock in Washington.      The poll also found support rising for the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic State. Some 35% in the new survey said military action against the group should be limited to air strikes, with 41% saying it should include combat troops, as well. A month earlier, some 40% called for airstrikes only, with 34% saying the U.S. should use combat troops as well as air strikes.     The outbreak of Ebola also is making an impression on voters, as 98% have heard or read about the deadly virus, a record level of awareness of major news events tracked by Journal/NBC polling.      The poll of 1,000 voters was taken Oct. 8-12, including the period when news was just emerging that a Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola.                                                                                                                                                     The emergence of ISIS and Ebola as attention-grabbing issues underscores the uncertainty surrounding which factors will shape the final three weeks of the campaign. “With all that is happening internationally, there can easily be an event that will redefine or define this election,” Mr. Yang said. ”This is a cake that’s not quite baked yet.”     Another wild card, and a symptom of voter discontent, is the growing appeal of third-party candidates. The poll found that voters are more likely than four years ago to say they would vote for Libertarian and Green party candidates if given a chance, with Libertarians drawing support from 9% of likely voters. The poll indicated that the presence of third-party candidates was a greater drag on the GOP than on Democratic prospects.     The poll comes as many Republicans are bullish about the prospects of gaining the net of six seats they need for a majority in the Senate, and of expanding their majority in the House. Fifty-two percent of Republicans said they were more enthusiastic about this election than past ones, compared with 40% of Democrats.     “I think that it’s very crucial this year that the conservative element takes back the Senate,” said Sam Hunter, a 68-year-old veterinarian from Sikeston, Mo. “We really do have a chance to move forward with a conservative agenda.”     But asked to rate their interest in the midterms on a scale of 1-to-10, only half rated their interest level as 9 or 10—about the same as in a June poll. In 2010, those showing a high level of interest rose sharply from 51% in June to 61% in October.     That is just one indicator of voter disillusionment. Approval of Congress matched its record low of 12%. One in eight said they would vote for a third-party candidate if they had a chance.Amid Mr. Obama’s low approval ratings, one-third of registered voters said their vote for Congress was intended to send a signal of opposition to the president. One-quarter said it was to send a signal of support to Mr. Obama.     Several voters said they were unlikely to cast ballots this year. “I am not interested anymore,” said Angela Teague, a Republican in San Diego. “I’ve always voted since I turned 18, but now I don’t think our votes count. I will still stay with my Republican Party, but they haven’t been doing much, either, just fighting.”     Ashley Jones, a nurse in Blytheville, Ark., also says she won’t vote, even though her state is hosting one of the year’s most competitive Senate races.     “Politics are politics,’’ said Ms. Jones. ”Everyone just puts on a face, and everyone is telling a lie."                                                 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko waves while getting a standing ovation after delivering remarks to a joint meeting of Congress on Sept. 18.          European Pressphoto Agency                                                                                                             The Washington establishment of both parties came in for scorn. Asked who is most responsible for Congress’s ineffectiveness, 26% named Republican House Speaker         John Boehner,    while 21% named Senate Majority Leader         Harry Reid,    with about the same share citing his fellow Democrat      Nancy Pelosi,        the House minority leader.     Some 30% of registered voters said their representative deserves to be re-elected, while 57% said it was time to give a new person a chance. But half of voters said their own representative was “part of the solution” to problems facing the country, while one-third said they were “part of the problem.”     That underscores the phenomenon of voters often disparaging Congress but liking their own representatives, and it suggests the 2014 election could produce less change than the anti-incumbent sentiment would indicate.     “They have told us they would lash out against the system, but it sure looks like more of the same,” said         Peter Hart,    a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey. “The voters roar like lions, but they vote like lambs.”                    WSJ/NBC News Poll Methodology                                                                                                                    The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 registered voters, including 350 respondents who use only a cellphone. It was conducted from Oct. 8-12, 2014, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff at Public Opinion Strategies and Fred Yang at Hart Research Associates. The sample was drawn in the following manner: Individuals were selected proportionate to the nation’s population in accordance with a probability sample design that gives all landline telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance to be included. Adults age 18 or over were selected by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. The cellphone sample was drawn from a list of cellphone users nationally. Of those interviewed, 350 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 41 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline. The data’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for registered voters and 3.8 percentage points for likely voters. Sample tolerances for subgroups are larger.     —Reid J.
