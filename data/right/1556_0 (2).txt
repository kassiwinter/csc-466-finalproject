Earlier today in Brooklyn, two New York City police officers were shot execution style in broad daylight by a gang member from Baltimore. The officers were killed while sitting in their patrol car. They were in the area working overtime and participating in an anti-terrorism exercise. They didn't have the chance to pull their weapons in defense. Their names were Officer Wenjian Liu and Officer Rafael Ramos. Officer Liu was recently married and is survived by his wife. Officer Ramos turned 40 on December 12 and leaves behind his wife and 13-year old son. Rest in peace PO Rafael Ramos and PO Wenjin Liu. Rest in peace PO Rafael Ramos and PO Wenjin Liu. #RIP #ThinBlueLine #fopstrong #NYPD @GLFOP pic.twitter.com/6UTIt0DucR— New York State FOP (@NYS_FOP) December 20, 2014
