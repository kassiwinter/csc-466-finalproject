U.S. stocks resumed their tumble after a brief upturn on Tuesday, as actions by China to shore up its economy failed to soothe investors rattled by the weeklong rout.After Monday’s tumultuous session, during which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,000 points intraday, trading was calmer. But worries about the pace of global growth persisted, and an early rally presented investors with an opportunity to sell shares at prices higher than in previous days. The blue-chip index surged by as much as 442 points before paring gains the rest of the day. Selling accelerated ahead of market close, with the Dow industrials ending down 204.91, or 1.3%, lower at 15666.44. The index has shed 11% after six straight days of losses.     The late-day selloff shattered a veneer of stability that had supported global markets after China’s central bank cut interest rates and flooded its banking system with liquidity. The announcement from the PBOC, which came after many Asian markets had closed, helped buoy shares in Europe and spurred exits from havens such as Treasurys and the Japanese yen.               “It’s disappointing to see the market give these gains away,” said         Ed Cowart,    portfolio manager of equity income and value strategies at Eagle Asset Management. “People used the bounce to lower their exposure to equities. There is still a lot of concern out there.”     Commodities such as crude oil and copper posted modest rebounds, and moves in emerging markets were subdued.     Tuesday’s moves are likely to intensify the debate over whether China’s economic slowdown will spill over into the U.S. and whether the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off on raising interest rates in response to the market turmoil. Fed officials have said they believe the U.S. recovery has picked up enough speed to warrant the first rate increase in nearly a decade.                                               An interest-rate cut by China’s central bank added fuel to a rally in European stocks and U.S. stock futures despite another sharp drop in Chinese shares. Charles Forelle reports.

What’s that doing to confidence in China’s leadership? WSJ’s Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer.                                                                                                         Today’s Markets        Before the latest gyrations, many economists and investors expected the Fed to tighten at their next policy-making meeting in September. Fed-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed Tuesday that investors and traders see a 21% likelihood of a rate increase in September, according to data from the         CME Group.    A couple of weeks ago, the odds were around 50%.     “It is this tug of war between those who see good opportunities [developed markets’ equities] and those who remain fearful that China’s slowdown will continue to worsen,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.     A reading of U.S. consumer confidence for August rose to the highest level since January. However, the survey was conducted this month through Aug. 13, meaning responses don’t reflect sentiment following the recent financial markets plunge.     Earlier Tuesday, there was no letup in the selling in Chinese markets. Shares in Shanghai closed 7.6% lower as the index fell below 3000 for the first time since December, following the worst one-day loss in more than eight years on Monday.      Japan’s Nikkei closed 4% lower after staging a short-lived recovery.     European shares rebounded sharply from the previous session’s slump. The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed 4.2% higher, its biggest one-day gain since September 2011.     Germany’s DAX rose 5%, France’s CAC 40 climbed 4.1%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was 3.1% higher.     “I suspect things will calm down in the short term,” said Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager         Brewin Dolphin.         Some investors went bargain hunting in the wreckage of the stock-market selloff. Some stocks that had suffered big declines in recent weeks were able to eke out gains on Tuesday. Among the Dow industrials, Apple and Walt Disney both closed 0.6% higher. In the past week, Apple shares are off 11% while Disney’s are off 10%.     All sectors in the S&P 500 500 ended lower, with utilities companies and telecom shares down the most, coinciding with a bounce back in Treasury yields. The S&P 500 fell 25.60, or 1.4%, to 1867.61, the lowest since October 2014. The         Nasdaq    Composite Index declined 19.76, or 0.4%, to 4506.49.      The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped back above 2% after piercing that level early Monday. In late-afternoon trading in New York, the yield closed at 2.133%, marking the biggest one-day increase since July 2013. Later, the yield crept back down as stocks sold off.     “There seems to be a more rational, calm environment today, whereas yesterday was more panicky,” said         Jim McDonald,    chief Investment strategist at Northern Trust.     Investors are realizing that growth in the U.S. and Europe is driven more by domestic factors, rather than a reliance on exports to China, Mr. McDonald said.      Because of that, “there is an increased confidence that China’s crisis won’t contaminate developed markets,” he said.     Oil prices also steadied, with Brent crude 1.2% higher at $43.21 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 2.8% to $39.31.     “Is this the bottom? We don’t know. But risk assets are much better priced than they were three weeks ago,” said Colin Harte, a multiasset portfolio manager at         BNP Paribas Investment Partners,    which manages €532 billion ($611.4 billion). Mr. Harte said he has bought global stocks and emerging-market bonds after Monday’s selloff.     Some investors were skeptical that global growth could persevere against the double whammy of a sharp deterioration in the outlook for China and higher rates in the U.S.     “The world economy isn’t robust enough to deal with that uncertainty,” said         Scott Jamieson,    head of multiasset investing at Kames Capital, which manages £52 billion ($81.7 billion) of assets. “I don’t think we are out of the woods yet.”     —Tommy Stubbington contributed to this article.
