         The White House and congressional Republicans remained at loggerheads—in both public and private—over how to design a deficit-reduction package, with just a few weeks remaining before the nation hits the fiscal cliff.     Leading figures on both sides doubled down on their positions in interviews that aired Sunday, and they blamed each other for the current standoff, reflecting the talks that House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) told "Fox News Sunday" have gone "nowhere."      Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, speaking on the same program for the Obama administration, suggested Republicans needed to take a breather from negotiations but would ultimately agree to raise tax rates—a key White House demand that is part of its push to raise $1.6 trillion in taxes over 10 years.                                                 Treasury Secretary Geithner thinks a deal will include tax increases.          CBS News/Reuters                                                                                                             "It's obviously a little hard for them now, and they're trying to figure out where they go next, and we might need to give them a little time to figure out where they go next," Mr. Geithner said.               Mr. Boehner told the television program that Republicans were willing to agree to about $800 billion in tax increases over 10 years, but only by closing tax breaks, not by raising rates.           Falling Over the Fiscal CliffSee some scenarios for how different groups of people may be affected by the tax changes that will take place if the fiscal cliff isn't resolved by the Jan. 1., 2013, deadline.           "When you go and increase tax rates, you make it more difficult for our economy to grow," Mr. Boehner said. "Half of that income is the small-business income."     The public posturing is a familiar element of negotiations that by any measure still have a long way to go. How political leaders talk in public isn't always a good indication of their private discussions. This time, both sides acknowledge they are running short on time before $500 billion in scheduled tax increases and spending cuts begin in January.     Congressional aides for both parties say current back-channel talks are just as unproductive as those taking place in front of the TV cameras.     Policy makers are aiming to secure a two-step deal by year-end. The first would lock in an initial round of spending cuts and potentially make changes to the tax code that would take effect in January. The second would require policy makers to pursue an overhaul of the tax code and entitlement programs, with the White House setting August as its target date for the negotiations to end.           More Fiscal Cliff           Despite the current brinkmanship, Messrs. Geithner and Boehner, as well as other negotiators, are leaving themselves room to negotiate and cut a deal by the end of the year. Mr. Geithner said Sunday the White House was open to making changes to Medicare and Medicaid beyond what it proposed in February, but he wanted Republicans to offer specific proposals first.     Senate Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.) has said a deal could include raising the eligibility age for Medicare above 65, requiring wealthier Americans to contribute more to the cost of their care, and slowing disbursement increases for Social Security benefits.     Mr. Boehner said Sunday that such changes to Medicare had been on the table during his 2011 talks with President Barack Obama about raising the debt ceiling.     Regarding Social Security, which pays benefits for the retired and disabled, Mr. Geithner said the White House would pursue talks to change the program, but he said any modifications couldn't be used to reduce the deficit.     "We think you have to do that in a separate process so that our seniors don't face the concern that we're somehow going to find savings in Social Security benefits to help reduce the other deficits," Mr. Geithner said on ABC.
