Supreme Court nominee         Brett Kavanaugh    and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, testified for more than eight hours in an often-wrenching hearing Thursday that highlighted and exposed many of the nation’s raw divisions.The hearing, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, laid bare the enormous stakes as the GOP tries to advance a nomination that would tilt the high court to the right and Democrats push for a thorough investigation into sexual-misconduct allegations in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Hovering over the proceedings were the coming November elections, which will determine control of Congress and the Trump administration’s ability to advance its agenda. Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, President Trump, who has forcefully defended his nominee, described the judge’s testimony as “powerful, honest and riveting” in a tweet. He also called for the Senate to vote on his nomination and criticized the process as a “total sham.”     The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Friday on the nomination. Republican senators said they expected the full chamber would hold its first procedural vote Saturday, and a final vote is expected early next week.               Judge Kavanaugh, fired up with indignation and frequently fighting back tears, defended his personal reputation against the assault allegations, while taking partisan swipes at the panel’s Democrats. “This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” he told the committee. “You have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.”     Earlier in the day, Dr. Ford, a California college professor, her voice halting at times, told lawmakers she had been “haunted by memories” since the alleged attack at a house party in the summer of 1982, which she said had left her struggling academically and coping with panic and anxiety for decades.     She said she was “100%” certain it was Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge who pushed her into a room, and that it was the judge who groped her and tried to remove her clothes. Mr. Judge has said he has no memory of the incident. Dr. Ford, 51 years old, said her memory of “the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense” was “indelible.”     Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has denied the allegations.     Hearing Brings Nation to StandstillSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, give hours of testimony to the Senate Judiciary CommitteeSupreme Court nominee Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh prepares to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to sexual-assault allegations against him.Erin Schaff/Press Pool1 of 17•••••     All eyes now will be on three Republican senators who have said they are concerned by the allegations and haven’t committed to backing Mr. Kavanaugh: Jeff Flake of Arizona,         Lisa Murkowski    of Alaska and         Susan Collins    of Maine.     Mr. Flake said late Thursday he was still undecided on the Kavanaugh vote. His position is of more immediate import because he is on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans have an 11-10 advantage on the panel, so a single “no” vote means the panel would send Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate with a negative recommendation. In the full Senate, Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage, so Judge Kavanaugh can afford no more than one GOP defection if all Democrats vote against him.                                         The Kavanaugh confirmation process has put an even greater focus on the concerns of women voters in the midterm elections of 2018. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

And it wasn’t just inside the Beltway: Images shared on social media showed people watching on airplanes, and stock brokers froze to attention at the New York Stock Exchange.     Mr. Trump watched the start of the hearings on Air Force One as he flew back to Washington from United Nations meetings in New York. He watched Judge Kavanaugh in the White House residence.     The two central figures in the showdown, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, didn’t watch each other’s testimony, according to their representatives.     The hearing came just short of one year since the #MeToo movement was launched with the New York Times’s first revelations about Hollywood mogul         Harvey Weinstein.    The movement has cut a swath through the political world, as at least a dozen politicians at the federal level have resigned, lost elections or announced they were retiring in the face of allegations of sexual misconduct.     Republicans avoided attacking Dr. Ford directly and set their aim on Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of withholding information about her allegations until the near-final stages of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. In response, Democrats repeatedly pressed Judge Kavanaugh to ask for a full Federal Bureau of Investigation look into the matter. The judge didn’t commit to pursuing a further investigation.              Sen. Lindsey Graham    (R., S.C.) at one point blasted Democrats and suggested the accusations against the judge were part of a power grab, telling fellow Republicans that if they voted down Judge Kavanaugh, “You're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.”     In later questioning,         Sen. Cory Booker    (D., N.J.) cited Mr. Graham’s comments in asking Judge Kavanaugh: “Do you think that people who would believe Dr. Ford are legitimizing despicable things?” Judge Kavanaugh replied by saying, “Listen to both sides before you make a bottom-line conclusion.”        
More        At stake in the hearing was the fate of a Supreme Court pick who could deliver a conservative tilt to the court for decades. The near-term political stakes were also high, as Republicans battle to keep their majorities in the House and Senate this fall.     The confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the top priority for many GOP voters, with filling the federal bench with conservatives a key reason that even those with reservations about Mr. Trump backed him in 2016. Republicans worry that if they can’t deliver confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh, it would demoralize GOP voters and depress turnout in a midterm election where their majority hinges on multiple tossup races.     But Republicans also run the risk of seeming insensitive to women voters who are already defecting in droves to the Democratic Party’s candidates. To limit that risk, they delegated the job of questioning Dr. Ford to an outside counsel, Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, while the Republicans on the panel mostly questioned Judge Kavanaugh themselves.     In his opening statement, the judge noted that the other people who were alleged to be at the 1982 party all said they didn’t recall Dr. Ford’s accounting of it; earlier, she had refuted that suggestion by saying they weren’t the ones attacked.     He also pointed to calendars that he kept as an adolescent that he said showed he was mostly out of town on weekends or had other engagements that would have left him no time for such a party.     “I am innocent of this charge,” he declared.     Some Republicans were unsettled by the hearing.     Jennifer Horn, former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said she believed Dr. Ford’s testimony was credible and should give Republicans pause.     “This is a come-to-Jesus moment for the Republican Party,” said Ms. Horn, who serves on the board of the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. “They have to decide who they are and what do they stand for.”     Ed Rollins, a GOP strategist with the pro-Trump Great America PAC, called Dr. Ford “a very powerful witness” and said the “Republican strategy to not participate but be represented by a prosecutor was a serious blunder.”     Judge Kavanaugh, though, “did what he needed to do. Any Republican who votes against him will pay a political price,” Mr. Rollins added.     Several Republicans watching the hearing, the majority of whom support Judge Kavanaugh, said Dr. Ford appeared credible, but they wouldn’t say whether or how that might affect their vote on the nomination.                                                 Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh each testified Thursday.

Shelley Moore Capito    (R., W.Va.) said she has “great empathy and sympathy” for Dr. Ford. “I think she’s giving very compelling testimony,” Ms. Capito said during a short break in the hearing. “I think something very bad has happened to her.”     Inside the White House, officials were watching the hearing with some trepidation, aware of the stakes. At the lunch break, one official said viewers would find Dr. Ford “emotional and sympathetic,” but said she had given varying numbers of people present at the party on the night in question.     Mr. Flake may have aptly predicted the inconclusive outcome of the hearing in a speech he gave Wednesday, when he quoted Simon & Garfunkel and said “people will hear what they want to hear and disregard the rest.”     Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
