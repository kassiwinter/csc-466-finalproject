UNITED NATIONS—President Trump criticized international organizations and alliances as unaccountable and defended his administration’s hard-line trade policies, urging fellow world leaders on Tuesday to chart their own paths toward sovereignty.Mr. Trump, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, offered a more subdued, but equally defiant performance to his first U.N. address last year, saying that he won’t entertain trade deals that aren’t fair and reciprocal, and don’t stand to benefit the American people. “We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred,” he said. “America will never apologize for protecting our citizens.”     Since his last appearance here, Mr. Trump has revised several global pacts and severed others. His unconventional attitude toward international treaties and multilateral alliances has rattled many countries, provoking questions on how a globalized world can cope with a protectionist U.S.          A stream of world leaders who spoke after Mr. Trump drew a contrast with the U.S. leader’s vision.     Iranian President         Hassan Rouhani,    whose government Mr. Trump attacked repeatedly during his speech, said the Islamic Republic was a peaceful nation committed to its international obligations, while the U.S. has disregarded global norms and used its power to bully others.                                         President Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, outlining his administration's hard-line stance on trade, foreign aid and more. Here are the highlights from his speech.

The U.N. is not in the hands of the U.S. administration,” Mr. Rouhani said.     He lashed out against Mr. Trump’s decision earlier this year to withdraw the U.S. from a 2015 international nuclear pact and said new American sanctions on Iran amounted to “economic terrorism.”     Mr. Trump broadly outlined his efforts to crack down on Iran to both deny the country nuclear weapons and curb its adversarial power in the region. The U.S. leader will further address nonproliferation when he chairs the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.                                         Following another round of tariffs between China and the U.S., the business community is pushing back. The WSJ’s Gerald F. Seib explains.

On Monday, as the U.S. leader met with French President         Emmanuel Macron    and other world leaders at a New York reception, the European Union announced that it would establish a special payment channel to allow companies to legally make financial transactions with Iran while avoiding exposure to U.S. sanctions.     Iran, which is allied with Syria’s government, also has been central to the Trump administration’s policy on Syria. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser,         John Bolton,    told the Associated Press on Monday that U.S. troops will remain in Syria so long as Iranian troops are deployed outside of Iran.     Asked after his speech whether he’d consider entering into talks with Iran, Mr. Trump said it may happen at some point. “Otherwise they’re going to be in the worst economic trouble of any country,” he added.     Mr. Macron, in his speech, denounced the rise of nationalist forces that he said had plunged the system of international cooperation into crisis. He warned of a “certain nationalism we’re seeing today, brandishing sovereignty as a way of attacking others.”     He defended a host of multilateral agreements—including the Paris Climate agreement, which Mr. Trump also withdrew from—as forms of cooperation that ensured world peace.        
Related        In an apparent reference to the U.S., he criticized the rise of trade disputes that he said would lead to isolationism and greater inequality. “The law of the strongest will only exacerbate tensions and violence…I don’t believe in this law of the strongest. Regardless of what type of legitimacy it masks itself behind,” Mr. Macron said.     Turkish President         Recep Tayyip Erdogan    said that “some countries are persistently trying to create chaos,” an apparent reference to the tariffs and sanctions the U.S. imposed on Turkey this year.      The Turkish leader said his country favored free trade. “Every regression will have negative repercussions for generations,” Mr. Erdogan said, minutes after Mr. Trump criticized multilateralism and free trade. “Trade wars have harmed humanity in every age. We are on the brink of another such period,” Mr. Erdogan added.     Mexican President         Enrique Peña Nieto    countered many of Mr. Trump’s views on international relations.                                         With the U.S out of the Iran nuclear agreement, the Trump administration is clamping down on the Iranian regime. The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib explains the sources of pressure.

Moments into his speech, Mr. Trump was met with an eruption of laughter from the General Assembly hall when he said his administration had “accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.”     Looking around the room, Mr. Trump said, “I didn’t expect that reaction.” He added, “But that’s OK,” a line that was met with applause.     His return to the U.N. focused broadly on how his “America First” foreign-policy vision offers a path toward mutual prosperity for the U.S. and its allies, urging them to pursue their own independent paths.      “I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and traditions,” Mr. Trump said. “The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.”     Mr. Trump took aim at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, saying that it is “ripping off the rest of the world” and he scolded World Trade Organization countries that “violate every single principle on which the organization is based.”     Mr. Trump signed a revised trade deal with South Korea on Monday. Some trade experts said the pact made only modest changes to the status quo.     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      He showcased his administration’s ongoing trade dispute with China, which abruptly canceled talks planned for this week, as the Trump administration imposed new 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports starting Monday. Mr. Trump has vowed additional tariffs if China targets U.S. farmers. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods.     “I have great respect and affection for my friend, President Xi, but I have made clear our trade imbalance is just not acceptable,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president, who didn’t plan to attend the gathering. “China’s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated.”     —Valentina Pop, Farnaz Fassihi, Stacy Meichtry and Chris Gordon contributed to this article.
