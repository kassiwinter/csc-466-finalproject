                                                  Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after his federal convictions on bank and tax fraud, among other crimes.

Mr. Manafort, 70 years old, is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after his federal convictions on bank and tax fraud, among other crimes. Mr. Manafort didn’t appear in court Wednesday because of health issues, the judge said.      The state indictment, brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, had accused the former Trump campaign chairman of submitting false documents to banks in order to obtain more than $20 million in loans. Mr. Manafort had faced 16 state charges, including residential-mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records.     In his ruling, Justice         Maxwell Wiley    said that the legal issues in question were relatively new ones for New York courts. “Given the rather unique set of facts pertaining to the defendant’s previous prosecution in federal court, and given New York’s law on this subject, defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment as barred by state double jeopardy law must be granted,” he wrote.                Lawyers for Mr. Manafort had asked the judge to toss the charges. “The indictment before this Court—charges brought by the New York County District Attorney based on alleged conduct identical to that for which Mr. Manafort was previously charged, tried, and sentenced—violates this black-letter New York law,” they wrote in court documents.        
Related Coverage        The state indictment was viewed as an apparent effort by the district attorney’s office to ensure Mr. Manafort served prison time if he were to be pardoned by President         Trump.    Mr. Trump has previously said he feels “very badly” for his former campaign chairman but a pardon wasn’t “right now on my mind.”     Prosecutors had said the indictment was valid because while the underlying actions were the same as those in a federal case, the state and federal crimes had different legal requirements.     After the ruling,         Todd Blanche,    a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, said the indictment was brought for political reasons. “This indictment should never have been brought, and today’s decision is a stark reminder that the law and justice should always prevail over politically-motivated actions,” he said.     A spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney         Cyrus Vance Jr.    said, “We will appeal today’s decision and will continue working to ensure that Mr. Manafort is held accountable for the criminal conduct against the People of New York that is alleged in the indictment.”     Mr. Manafort was previously convicted in two different federal courts.     The state indictment was unsealed in March, just minutes after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., sentenced Mr. Manafort to 43 months in prison. He had previously been sentenced by a different federal judge to 47 months in prison for bank and tax fraud, leaving him a total sentence of more than seven years.      Mr. Manafort is serving his sentence at a low-security federal prison in Loretto, Pa. He is scheduled to be released on Dec. 25, 2024, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
