                                          The Kremlin has taken steps to prepare Russians for deeper international isolation as Europe moves toward more sweeping sanctions against Moscow, with the U.S. vowing to follow suit, over Russia's involvement in Ukraine. WSJ's Anton Troianovski joins the News Hub to discuss.

The new U.S. measures, which target three state-controlled banks and Russian shipping firms, follow an agreement by the European Union Tuesday to adopt its strictest sanctions yet on broad sectors of the Russian economy.      "Today is a reminder that the United States means what it says," Mr. Obama said in a statement at the White House. "The sanctions we're announcing today will have an even bigger bite," because they are matched by sanctions from the Europeans.     The U.S. sanctions place restrictions on         VTB    Group,       Bank of Moscow,    and Russian Agricultural Bank, among other entities.               Mr. Obama said the U.S. has evidence that Russia is arming separatists in eastern Ukraine and has launched artillery attacks over the border. Asked whether the U.S. is considering military assistance to Ukraine, Mr. Obama said Ukraine's military is better armed than the separatists.      "The issue is how to prevent bloodshed in eastern Ukraine…and the main tool we have to influence Russian behavior is influence over its economy," he said.     He said he would continue to engage Mr. Putin on a diplomatic solution to the crisis, while insisting that Moscow's standoff with the West doesn't mark the beginning of a new Cold War.     "It does not have to be this way. This is a choice that Russia, and President Putin in particular, has made," Mr. Obama said.      "It's not a new Cold War," he added. "What it is is a very specific issue related to Russia's unwillingness to recognize that Ukraine can chart its own path."                                                 U.S. President Barack Obama speaks to reporters about new sanctions imposed on Russia in Washington on Tuesday.
