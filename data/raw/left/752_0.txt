  Even as China boasts of getting the coronavirus outbreak under control, the number of asymptomatic cases has risen, according to health officials where the pandemic began late last year.  The National Health Commission reported Monday that 78 new asymptomatic cases have been recorded in China in the past 24 hours, up from 47 a day earlier.  More than 1,000 asymptomatic cases are still under “medical observation,” the NHC said.  NHC spokesman Mi Feng warned of the spread of coronavirus from outsiders as well.   “The risk of imported cases from our neighboring countries keeps rising,” he said at a press conference Monday, according to Reuters.  Health officials have warned of the dangers of asymptomatic patients who may be unaware they are spreading coronavirus.   Wuhan, China, where the harshest global lockdowns were implemented in an attempt to stop coronavirus, normal life has started to return as people are allowed out for the first time in months.  As of Monday, more than 82,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in China. Of those, more than 3,300 have died.
