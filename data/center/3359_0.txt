U.S., U.K. and French forces launched airstrikes targeting sites associated with Syria’s chemical-weapons capabilities, a reprisal for an attack last week that killed at least 43 civilians and injured hundreds more.The decision to strike was aimed at cutting off the production and use of chemical weapons in the country, President      Donald Trump        said at the White House on Friday night.          Mr. Trump blamed “Russia’s failure” for the suspected chemical attack in Syria, saying Moscow had vowed to stop the use of such weapons in the country. He said Russia needs to decide whether it will continue down a “dark path” in Syria or become a force for “stability and peace.”     “Hopefully, someday, we’ll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran—but maybe not,” Mr. Trump said.               The strikes were a culmination of a weeklong international push to punish the regime of President         Bashar al-Assad    after images and videos emerged last Saturday from the Syrian city of Douma suggesting civilians—including children—had suffered in the attack.     Syria and its chief patron, Russia, have denied that chemical weapons were used in Douma.     Mr. Trump said the operation would be “sustained” until the Syrian regime stopped using chemical weapons. Defense Secretary         Jim Mattis    and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,         Gen. Joe Dunford,    said at a Pentagon briefing it was a single wave of strikes that is complete, for now.     “This is a one-time shot,” Mr. Mattis said. “Right now, we have no additional strikes planned.”                                          U.S., British and French forces struck sites associated with Syria’s chemical-weapons capabilities on Friday.

Dunford said manned aircraft were used in the attack on targets including a Damascus scientific research center and a storage facility for chemical weapons. He said the strikes would set back Syria’s chemical-weapons program for years.      The U.S. didn’t give advance notice to Russia, which has forces in Syria, Gen. Dunford said. He said the only communication with the Russians leading up to the strike campaign was via a phone line designed for the two nations to communicate during the war against Islamic State, but those communications weren’t intended as formal notification.     U.S. and U.K. submarines armed with missiles moved within strike range of Syria. A U.S. destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, and the French frigate Aquitaine were in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, while three more American cruisers and destroyers are currently deployed in the Middle East.      The U.S. took pains to avoid civilian casualties and any targets with foreign personnel, Mr. Mattis said. He has expressed concerns that any airstrike operation not escalate the conflict in Syria with Russia or Iran.      The coalition used twice the number of weapons in the attack than were used last year in Mr. Trump’s first airstrike against a Syrian air base, Mr. Mattis said.         Related        The 2017 strike was intended to be a one-time action to dissuade Syrian forces from using chemical weapons. Mr. Trump has said nearly 20% of the Syrian air force was destroyed in that strike. But the airfield was quickly back in operation and Mr. Assad returned to using less-lethal chlorine gas.     Syrian state media reported that 13 rockets were intercepted early Saturday. It posted a photo showing red tracers in the sky.     “The American, British and French enemies have targeted more than one area around Damascus and the air defenses thwarted several of these targetings,” one report said.     In a statement early Saturday, British Prime Minister         Theresa May    said world powers sought to avoid military action, but Russia had thwarted diplomatic efforts at the United Nations.     “This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,” Ms. May said. “It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.”     French President         Emmanuel Macron    said, “The red line declared by France in May 2017 had been crossed.” He also emphasized the targeted goals of the strikes.     “Our response has been limited to the Syrian regime’s facilities enabling the production and employment of chemical weapons,” Mr. Macron said in a statement. “We cannot tolerate the normalization of the employment of chemical weapons, which is an immediate danger to the Syrian people and to our collective security.”     Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., warned that Moscow would respond to Mr. Trump.          “We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences,” he said in a statement. “All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.” Mr. Antonov said “insulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible.”     Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes, saying there would be unspecified “consequences and repercussions for this adventurism,” according to state news agency IRNA. Iran said the chemical-weapons allegations against Syria were unsubstantiated and criticized the U.S. and its allies for assuming the role of “judge and global police.”     The course of Mr. Trump’s Syria policy has shifted over time. Just last week, he said the U.S. would be leaving Syria as soon as the coalition had defeated Islamic State, pockets of which remain in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. Within days, the chemical attack occurred.      He returned to the issue of the U.S. troops in Syria on Friday but didn’t call for their quick removal.     “America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances,” Mr. Trump said. “As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home.”     As Mr. Trump delivered his remarks, his new national security adviser         John Bolton    and press secretary         Sarah Sanders    watched from a corner in the room. Mr. Bolton rarely looked up from a paper as Mr. Trump spoke.      In Lima, Peru, Vice President      Mike Pence,        attending a summit of Western Hemisphere leaders, abruptly rushed to his hotel instead of attending a reception and banquet hosted by hosting leaders.      Leading up to the strikes, the U.S. and France engaged in a series of talks beginning within a day of the suspected chemical-weapons attack. They were later joined by the U.K.      Mr. Assad had sought to limit the impact of an expected attack by moving warplanes under the protection of Russian air defenses.     Unlike last year’s chemical attack in Syria, evidence that the regime was behind the most recent incident wasn’t immediately evident.     Independent observers couldn’t easily reach the affected area, which is surrounded by the regime. Moreover, the U.S. believed the weapons this time were delivered by helicopters, which are harder to track than the fixed-wing airplanes that carried out last year’s attack.     U.S. officials concluded that the regime dropped barrel bombs but struggled to independently determine what chemicals were in those bombs, a U.S. official said.     —Gordon Lubold and Louise Radnofsky in Washington, Sune Engel Rasmussen and Raja Abdulrahim in Beirut and Aresu Eqbali in Tehran contributed to this article.
