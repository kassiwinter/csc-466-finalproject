St. Louis, MO - In the first half hour of the second 2016 presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump said several things conservative voters have always wanted to say - both to Hillary Clinton and to the media. Trump walked right over to Clinton in the first minutes of the presidential town hall and confronted her with questions about her missing 30,000 emails that were deleted after her work in the State Department.Then, Trump questioned Anderson Cooper, who moderated along with Martha Raddatz as to why he hasn't done his job as a journalist and mentioned the Democratic nominee's email scandal. Cooper said he had, but that didn't convince Trump, who mumbled that he was in a "three-on-one" debate.Trump says the debate is "One-on-three" pic.twitter.com/NoNjkbx12t— Washington PostVideo (@PostVideo) October 10, 2016
Trump has statistics on his side, too. After 50 minutes of the debate, the RNC tallied that Cooper and Raddatz had interrupted Trump 14 times, and Clinton just three times.
