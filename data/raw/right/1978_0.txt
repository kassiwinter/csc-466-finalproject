           Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Sunday she will be voting for the Iran nuclear deal despite reservations she still has about it.
Appearing Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union," Wasserman Schultz said that she has gone through a "gut-wrenching, thought-provoking process" before making her decision.

Wasserman Schultz represents a Florida district with a large Jewish population, and also is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
She said she still has reservations that the International Atomic Energy Agency may wane over time in its vigilance in enforcement and that Iran still might be able to divert money to terrorist groups.
But she said she was assured by intelligence officials that the story that Iran will be able to inspect itself is not true. If it were, she said, it would have been a deal-breaker.
"There's nothing more important as a Jew to ensure Israel's existence is there throughout our generations," Wasserman Shultz said, tearing up. "I'm confident the process I've gone through to reach this decision is one to ensure Israel will be there forever. It's the homeland of my people."           Â© 2022 Newsmax.
