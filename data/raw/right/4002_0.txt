In the daily headlines, the government shutdown—now the longest in American history—is reported as a clash between two uncompromising forces: President Trump and Speaker      Nancy Pelosi.        In this battle, however, the most important general may be the one who’s escaped almost all notice. Senate Majority Leader         Mitch McConnell    has put on full display his penchant for knowing when the best course is to do nothing. In the received wisdom, because Mr. Trump infamously welcomed a shutdown in December’s televised and contentious Oval Office meeting with Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader         Chuck Schumer,    he gets all the blame for it. It’s only a matter of time, it follows, before skittish Republicans abandon him and he is forced to cry uncle. Naturally this is feeding regular news stories about “cracks” in the GOP coalition.     Enter Mr. McConnell. By making clear he won’t send up a bill the president won’t sign, the Kentucky Republican has empowered Mr. Trump while sparing his Senate GOP caucus the pressure that would come from the meaningless votes to reopen government that his Democratic counterpart, Mr. Schumer, is so desperate to have. It works even better because Mr. McConnell isn’t a grandstander.     Nor is it his first time around this block. In February 2016, Justice         Antonin Scalia    died while on a hunting trip in West Texas. That same day Mr. McConnell released a statement about what would happen next. “The American people,” he wrote “should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.”                        Barack Obama    had a different idea. A month after Scalia’s death he nominated         Merrick Garland,    chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the seat. But Mr. McConnell soon schooled Mr. Obama in constitutional powers. While the president has the power to nominate, the Senate is under no obligation to consent.     Not only did Mr. McConnell’s decision to defer any hearings until after the election ultimately result in         Neil Gorsuch    being seated instead of Judge Garland, it likely helped make Mr. Trump president. Many Republicans who had grave doubts about Mr. Trump ended up pulling the lever for him anyway because they didn’t want         Hillary Clinton    deciding the composition of the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump further obliged by producing an impressive list of qualified jurists from which he said he would choose.     Now Mr. McConnell’s do-nothing approach is again confounding Democrats. House Republicans don’t matter much because Mrs. Pelosi has a Democratic majority, and so long as she can keep her caucus together she doesn’t need Republicans. The battle is for the Senate. But so long as Mr. McConnell refuses to hold votes on any bill without funding for the wall, Republican senators are unlikely to feel much pressure to split from the president.     Recent polls confirm as much. Two of them—one by YouGov/Economist and the other by Survey USA—report that between half and two-thirds of Americans blame the shutdown on Mr. Trump. These same polls show a third to a quarter blaming Mrs. Pelosi. But only 4% or 5% are blaming Republicans in Congress.     Think about that. News reports envision defecting Senate Republicans forcing a vote for a bill that wouldn’t include wall funding, but if Mr. McConnell holds the line it will never even get to that point. What incentive is there for him to change?     Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is coming to own the issue of border security. Not everyone is for a wall. But how tenable, over the long haul, is Mrs. Pelosi’s position that there isn’t a single thing the president could give her that would lead her to agree to offer even a dollar more in wall funding?     Not only is the speaker throwing away the best opportunity she will have these next two years to get the president to sign off on some Democratic priorities, but with each day her intransigence conveys to more Americans it isn’t only the wall Democrats oppose. It’s any genuine border security.     So where does it end? Those expecting an epic capitulation on either side are unrealistic; it would be too humiliating given the positions they’ve staked out. But sooner or later the Democrats are likely to feel pressure to give Mr. Trump more wall funding—less, certainly, than the $5.7 billion he’s seeking but more than the $1.3 billion they’ve offered—to get out of this impasse.     Going forward, most attention will continue to rest on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, who are all holding meetings, issuing statements before the TV cameras, and trying to make their respective cases to the public. Meanwhile, it may be Mr. McConnell who holds the key.      Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8
