All eyes are on Wisconsin Tuesday where this could be a game-changing primary day. For Republicans, the day's final vote count could determine whether the candidates are headed towards a contested convention.
Donald Trump's front-runner status could be in jeopardy, with the latest polls showing Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ahead by five to 10 points.
"Your vote is going to be very important tomorrow because the world is watching Wisconsin. The world is watching," Trump told his supporters.
A win for Cruz in Wisconsin would make it harder for Trump to secure the Republican nomination outright in the party's primaries by the time voting ends in June, increasing the likelihood of a contested convention.
"I think the energy, the enthusiasm, the momentum we are seeing is a result of the fact that the people of this state, the people of this country, are looking for real positive solutions, not simply someone to yell and scream and curse," Cruz said.
Meanwhile, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton isn't leading in Wisconsin either.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, is currently ahead by four points, according to the latest Marquette University poll.
"We have won six out of the last seven primary and caucus contests," the Vermont lawmaker said. 
A loss for Clinton in Wisconsin wouldn't likely cost her the nomination, but it would help Sanders keep up his momentum.
Speaking at rallies in her home state of New York, Clinton touted her delegate lead and vowed to increase minimum wage nationally.
"This is something else Americans deserve across our country..." she told supporters. "And I again will proudly take what's happening here in New York and go to Washington!"
But both Clinton and Trump face tough roadblocks in Wisconsin on the path to the nominations of their parties -- and ahead of Tuesday's voting, it doesn't look like either one of them will win in the Badger State.
