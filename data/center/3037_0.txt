WASHINGTON—As President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas following Sunday’s mass shooting, some congressional Republicans said Wednesday they were willing to consider legislation banning a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon.Mr. Trump spoke to patients in their hospital rooms, extending invitations to visit him in the White House, before meeting separately with law-enforcement officials and commending them for a rapid response that limited the number of casualties. “America is truly a nation in mourning,” Mr. Trump said at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. “Many families tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty.”     After his hospital visit, the GOP president sidestepped a question about gun policy. “We’re not going to talk about that today,” he said.                Republicans traditionally have resisted restrictions around gun sales. But senior GOP lawmakers in both chambers said this week that they wanted to look at legislation introduced Wednesday by Sen.         Dianne Feinstein    (D., Calif.) that would ban the sale, transfer, manufacture or possession of “bump stocks” and other accessories that accelerate a semiautomatic weapon’s rate of firing.

The rampage killed 58 people and left more than 500 injured.     “If somebody can essentially convert a semiautomatic to an automatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in Las Vegas, that’s something of obvious concern that we ought to explore,” Senate Majority Whip         John Cornyn    (R., Texas) said.     Mr. Cornyn said he had urged Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to hold a hearing on the issue. Mr. Grassley said in a statement Wednesday that he needed more information about the Las Vegas massacre before making a decision about a hearing.     At least one Senate Republican, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said he supported banning bump stocks, noting he viewed them in the same category as automatic weapons. “I have no problem in banning those,” he said.     In the House, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R., Fla.) is working on bipartisan legislation to ban bump stocks that he hopes to introduce soon, his spokeswoman said.

The device allows the firearm to slide back and forth rapidly, as the shooter leans into it, harnessing the energy in the recoil. The trigger “bumps” into the finger, faster than it can be pulled.              Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,    one of the largest firearms retailers in the U.S., said it removed on Tuesday several listings for bump stocks that were listed on its website by third-party sellers. A spokeswoman said Wednesday the items “violate our prohibited items policy and never should have been sold on our site.     Various efforts to tighten gun laws have failed after a string of mass shootings in recent years, most notably after the massacres at a Connecticut elementary school in late 2012 and at a nightclub in Florida in June 2016.                                         Police released video recorded by officers' body cameras as they responded to Sunday's mass shooting at a concert near the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

The National Rifle Association, which has opposed many gun-related measures in the past, didn’t return a request for comment on Ms. Feinstein’s legislation.     The White House has signaled that Mr. Trump isn’t likely to soften the pro-gun rights position he staked out during last year’s presidential campaign. Talking points sent by the White House to political allies played down the need for new gun-control laws.     “And when it comes to gun control,” the talking points read, “let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people. They will curtail the freedoms of law-abiding citizens.”     The measure would also meet an influential opponent in House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R.,La.), who recently returned to the Capitol after suffering a near-fatal gunshot wound in June during a practice for an annual congressional baseball game.     “The country has debated it,” Mr. Scalise said of gun control. “It was a major issue in the presidential election. It’s a major issue in a lot of congressional races. If the country wanted more gun control, I think you would see different makeups in Congress.”     Semiautomatic firearms shoot one bullet for each trigger pull, while automatic weapons fire bullets continuously with one pull of the trigger. Federal law bars civilians from owning an automatic weapon made after 1986.     “Automatic weapons have been illegal for more than 30 years, but there’s a loophole in the law that can be exploited to allow killers to fire at rates of between 400 and 800 rounds-per-minute,” Ms. Feinstein said Wednesday, when she introduced legislation supported by 24 other members of the Senate Democratic caucus.     Ms. Feinstein had included a ban on bump stocks in her 2013 proposal to ban the manufacture and sale of certain semiautomatic rifles, as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines. The measure was defeated with a 40-60 vote in 2013 when the Democratic-controlled Senate didn’t pass gun-control legislation after the elementary school shooting in Connecticut.     Republicans have generally been wary of Democratic efforts to tighten gun-control laws after mass shootings, but GOP lawmakers said the bump stock and its role in Sunday night’s shooting raised new questions for them.     “Automatic weapons are not legal unless you have a very specialized permit, a license, which requires a lot more than going through a background check,” Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said Wednesday. “So if it effectively converts it to an automatic, we need to look at it,” he said of bump stocks.     On Tuesday, Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a gun owner, said he would consider Ms. Feinstein’s legislation if it cleared the Senate.     “I’d look at it, for sure,” Sen.         David Perdue    (R., Ga.) said. “You can’t buy a chain-fed machine gun in the U.S. today. There’s a reason for that and I’d want to make sure nobody had access to that if that’s the law of the land.”     Many Republicans said they had never heard of bump stocks before this week and wanted to do more research on how they work.     “I’m interested in learning more about it,” Sen.         Jeff Flake    (R., Ariz.) said. “I grew up on a farm and a ranch and this is a new one.”     House Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) hasn’t weighed in on the legislation, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Tuesday it was “premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.”     Some Senate Democrats running for re-election in conservative-leaning states said they supported Ms. Feinstein’s bill.     “It’s a loophole in the law,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) said of bump stocks’ legality. “The notion that we’re allowing an add-on that allows people to convert any semiautomatic to an automatic weapon, we ought to address that.”     Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat running for re-election in Montana next year, said he didn’t yet know enough about bump stocks to weigh in.     “The first time I heard the word bump stock was yesterday. I need to get more information,” Mr. Tester said. “We’ll find out what the hell they are.”     —Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.
