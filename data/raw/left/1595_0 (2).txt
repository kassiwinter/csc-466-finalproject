Seventeen people were killed in three days of violence last week that started with a shooting attack on the Charlie Hebdo weekly.The Paris march was attended by the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and the U.S. ambassador to France. "We have offered, from the first moment, our intel, our law enforcement and all of our efforts, and I really think that, you know, this is sort of quibbling a little bit," Kerry said, in response to a reporter's question.The U.S. relationship with France was "not about one day, or one particular moment."IN-DEPTHHero Who Saved 15 in France Attack: 'It's Nothing'Arsonists Attack Paper That Republished Charlie Hebdo CartoonsParis Grocery Gunman Claims Allegiance to ISIS in Video— Reuters
