                             Updated July 6, 2021 1:01 pm ET                            Champlain Towers South fell in the predawn hours of June 24, leaving a pile of rubble and scores of people missing in Surfside, Fla. After 14 days of searching for survivors, crews transitioned to a recovery effort. They continue to comb through the debris looking for the remains of those missing, as investigators probe the cause of the building’s collapse.     Here’s what we know about the disaster.     What happened? The northeast part of a condo tower in the Miami-area beachfront town of Surfside collapsed about 1:30 a.m. on June 24.           What caused the collapse? Federal, state and local officials are working to determine the cause of the collapse.               A 2018 engineering report on the building, released by the town, warned the condo association that there was a “major error” in its design that allowed water to pool near its base. But another report by the same engineering firm cited an inspection that gave the building its top grade on several measures, yielding a seemingly conflicting message. A 2018 email showed the engineering firm estimated that the cost of needed major repairs exceeded $9.1 million.

The death toll stood at 60 Thursday, Miami Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said. Officials said 80 people were unaccounted for.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology opened an investigation into the cause of the condo collapse. NIST is a part of the U.S. Commerce Department that has the authority to establish special teams to investigate building failures. The team will have access to the site, power to subpoena evidence and access to records and documents. The work will include analyzing how the building was designed, built, modified and maintained. The probe could take years to complete.     State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle has said she would impanel a grand jury to investigate the condo disaster. She said she wouldn’t wait for NIST to finish its investigation. “I will not do anything to jeopardize their investigative findings,” she said. “However, this is a matter of extreme public importance.”             Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
