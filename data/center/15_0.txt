Iran said it was taking steps to increase uranium enrichment that would break limits set in a 2015 nuclear deal by Monday morning, violating for the second time elements of the multiparty accord and putting it at risk of collapse.Sunday’s move marks the end of a 60-day deadline Iran issued in May for European nations to do more to offset the economic impact of sanctions by the U.S., which pulled out of the pact last year. Iran said it had sent a letter to the European Union issuing another two-month deadline to take further action, but didn’t disclose what those measures would be.     The EU is extremely concerned by Iran’s announcement, a spokeswoman for the bloc’s foreign-policy chief,         Federica Mogherini,    said. In comments coordinated with France, Germany and Britain, the spokeswoman said the EU would discuss next steps with Russia and China, the other participants in the nuclear deal.               “We had called upon Iran not to take further measures that undermine the nuclear deal,” the spokeswoman,         Maja Kocijancic,    said. “We strongly urge Iran to stop and reverse all activities inconsistent with its commitments under the” nuclear deal.     “Iran better be careful,” President Trump told reporters in New Jersey on Sunday.      Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo    on Sunday threatened further steps against Iran in response to its plans to accelerate uranium enrichment.     “Iran’s latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions,” he said on Twitter. “Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s regime, armed with nuclear weapons, would pose an even greater danger to the world.”     European officials have said they may trigger a dispute procedure in the accord if Iran continues to breach its obligations. That would start a weekslong process that could end with international sanctions being reimposed on Tehran, effectively killing the accord. The EU spokeswoman said the bloc, which chairs the body that is supposed to resolve conflicts over the deal, could call a meeting of this commission in coming days.     Russia and China have more economic and political leverage with Iran, as Chinese efforts to continue oil imports provide a critical lifeline to the nuclear deal. But while Russian officials have expressed regret over Iran’s step, neither country has given any indication it would seek to isolate Iran. Both have laid the blame for Iran’s moves firmly with Washington’s decision to quit the deal and ratchet up sanctions.      Since Mr. Trump pulled out of the pact, Tehran has warned it would step up nuclear activities in a bid to raise the pressure on Europe, China and Russia to provide relief from crippling U.S. economic sanctions and to raise costs on Washington for continuing its pressure campaign.      Iran said it would begin making technical changes at its nuclear facilities to start enriching uranium above the 3.67% allowed under the nuclear deal, surpassing the limit by Monday morning. That move would bring Iran a small step closer to having fissile material that could be used in an atomic weapon. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched.     “Tomorrow early morning we will have passed over 3.67%,” said         Behrouz Kamalvandi,    spokesman for Iran’s atomic agency.     He didn’t say to what level Iran would enrich uranium, but said it was to supply fuel to power plants, indicating Iran will initially only enrich at 5% purity.      “If the 3.67% becomes 3.68%, or 4% or 5%, it is not important. This has a political strategic significance,” said         Abbas Araghchi,    Iran’s deputy foreign minister and a key player in the nuclear negotiations.     Iranian officials said the latest decision wasn’t meant to undermine the nuclear accord, but that it was up to the remaining parties to live up to their commitments.     Iran, which has produced uranium enriched to as much as 20% in the past, maintains it isn’t violating the nuclear agreement but merely invoking a clause in the deal that allows for one side to cease partly or in full its commitments if another party isn’t fulfilling its commitments. European countries say Iran hasn’t gone through the necessary process to take that step.          Iran’s brinkmanship could present Mr. Trump, who has spoken out against U.S. involvement in Middle East conflicts, with difficult questions as he prepares for the 2020 elections.      The U.S. on Friday summoned a special session of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency to consider Iran’s actions, which will take place on July 10. The Vienna-based agency oversees Iran’s obligations under the 2015 deal.     “The international community must hold Iran’s regime accountable,” the U.S. said.     A spokesman for the United Nations agency said inspectors will be checking to see if Iran goes over the 3.67% limit.      Iran’s apparent decision to enrich at 5% purity, instead of moving to enrich at a higher level, reflects a political strategy of incrementally increasing pressure on Europe and the U.S., said         Behnam Ben Taleblu    of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank that has supported tough sanctions on Tehran.      Some European diplomats had hoped Iran would take months to move clearly in violation of the agreement. Still, with Iran only increasing its uranium stockpile and enrichment levels gradually, it is likely to strengthen voices in Europe saying there is still time for diplomacy.      French President         Emmanuel Macron    spoke with Iranian President         Hassan Rouhani    on Saturday and said he was deeply concerned about Tehran’s weakening of the accord, and “the consequences that would necessarily follow.”      Messrs. Macron and Rouhani also agreed to explore by July 15 the conditions for a resumption of talks between the remaining parties to the agreement, Mr. Macron said.      Asked about the prospect of the U.S. joining the talks, Mr. Araghchi said that is possible on the condition that the U.S. lifts sanctions.      Tightened American sanctions have reduced Iranian oil exports by about 90%, causing severe ripple effects across the economy and driving Tehran to adopt a more confrontational stance.     In addition to the nuclear activities, the U.S. has accused Iran of attacking tankers and Saudi oil facilities—charges Iran denies. In June, Iran shot down an American spy drone.     The steps Iran has taken don’t significantly impact on Iran’s breakout time—how long it would take Tehran to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear bomb. The nuclear deal was crafted to ensure Iran’s breakout time was at least a year.     Iran has steered clear of actions or threats to other key parts of the deal. Western diplomats say Iran has, for the most part, allowed timely inspections of nuclear-related facilities by the IAEA’s monitors.     It also hasn’t threatened to disregard limits on the number and type of centrifuges it deploys to enrich uranium, a critical component of maintaining the one-year breakout time.     Under the deal, Iran was required to remove and place in storage two-thirds of its close-to-20,000 centrifuges, most of which were basic machines of a type used decades ago in Western countries. Iran also placed in storage around 1,000 somewhat more advanced machines.     Were Iran to speedily reinstall all its centrifuges or add more advanced ones, it could significantly reduce the time needed to produce a nuclear weapon to below one year, a threshold Trump administration officials say they are closely monitoring.        
Related        Iranian officials on Sunday said increasing the number of centrifuges wasn’t necessary for now.      “We don’t need to increase centrifuges,” Mr. Kamalvandi said. “Adding centrifuges is an option the country’s senior officials can choose.”     Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    called the Iranian move a “dangerous step” and asked European leaders to fulfill their commitments to apply sanctions on Iran should it break the nuclear deal.     —Dov Lieber in Tel Aviv and Michael R.
