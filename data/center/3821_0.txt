WASHINGTON—President Trump amplified his anti-immigration message ahead of next week’s midterm elections, saying he was now prepared to deploy as many as 15,000 troops to the Mexican border in anticipation of a migrant caravan and would press ahead with his planned executive order to end birthright citizenship.“We’re going to be prepared. They are not coming into our country,” Mr. Trump said of the caravan of Central Americans now many hundreds of miles away and moving through Mexico. The president spoke to reporters before departing for Florida for the latest in a series of campaign rallies before Tuesday’s vote.     Mr. Trump, a Republican, has made immigration and secure borders a priority issue in the final days before the election, an effort to motivate his core supporters in tight House and Senate races, including contests in border states key to continued Republican control of the House and Senate.               Mr. Trump’s promise to deploy “anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel” to the Mexican border caught the Pentagon by surprise, according to officials there. The figure was a marked increase from Monday, when the planned strength stood at 5,239 active-duty troops deployed this week and another 2,000 National Guard troops sent earlier this year.                                                 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s remarks marked his first public comments since the U.S. military announced the troop deployment.

Great,” Mr. Trump said at his Wednesday evening rally in Estero, Fla. “People didn’t want to bring it up. I said, ‘We have to bring it up.’ ”     Birthright citizenship is afforded under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has the backing of more than a century of legal precedent. Legal scholars called Mr. Trump’s plan for an executive order unconstitutional, and critics decried it as an election-season gambit designed to excite GOP voters. Several Republican lawmakers have also criticized the idea.     Despite the legal consensus, Mr. Trump said he had met with “some very talented legal scholars” and believes he could use executive action.     “I’d rather do it through Congress because that’s permanent,” Mr. Trump said. “But we can certainly do it through—I really believe we can do it through—executive order.”        
More        He made a comparison to the executive action President Obama took to shield hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation, a move that Republicans have called unconstitutional and that is the subject of continuing court action.     “Certainly, if he can do DACA, we can do this by executive order,” Mr. Trump said, using the shorthand for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. “With that being said, I think Congress will ultimately act, but I may very well do it by executive order.”     Republican lawmakers have periodically introduced legislation to limit birthright citizenship without success.         Rep. Steve King    (R., Iowa) has repeatedly done so, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Tuesday morning that he would push for another legislative effort.     House Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) said Tuesday birthright citizenship couldn’t be ended by executive order. “We didn’t like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action, and obviously as conservatives, we believe in the Constitution,” he said in a radio interview.     Mr. Trump, who believes that birthright citizenship encourages illegal immigration, fired back Wednesday on         Twitter    : “Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!”     The troops being deployed to the border are expected to be in place ahead of the caravan of about 4,000 would-be asylum seekers and migrants from Central America walking toward the U.S. border.                                         President Trump said the U.S. will end Central American aid as thousands of migrants march toward the U.S. border. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why this might be counterproductive.

A second, smaller caravan crossed the Guatemalan-Mexican border Tuesday and also is expected to make its way to the U.S. border.     It isn’t clear where members of either caravan would attempt to cross the border.     Supporters of the military response have said the caravans are increasingly organized and violent.     “Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!” Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday.     The White House has provided no evidence that criminals or gang members are hiding among the migrants. Many of the migrants have said they are fleeing violence and oppression back home in crime-ridden Central America.     U.S. troops aren’t legally allowed to enforce U.S. laws inside the country. The Pentagon has said their mission is to provide logistics, medical and transport support for Customs and Border Protection officials. In addition, military commanders have said that the troops will be tasked to “harden” ports of entry.     The Pentagon announced Wednesday that nine engineer units, three aviation units, military police units, 13 logistics units and five media units would deploy to the southwest border.     Minutes after Mr. Trump said that up to 15,000 could be at the border, the Pentagon released a statement saying the “initial estimate is that the [Department of Defense] will have more than 7,000 troops” at the border.     If the Pentagon does ultimately deploy 15,000 troops to the Mexican border, as Mr. Trump suggested, it would roughly equal the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.     The troops are scheduled to be in place until mid-December. Unless the first caravan accelerates its pace by taking buses or trucks to the border, it is not expected to arrive until after that time.     Write to Nancy A.
