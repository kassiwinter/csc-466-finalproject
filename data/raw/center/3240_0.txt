Media caption, Top Democratic Nancy Pelosi breaks record in eight-hour speechUS politician Nancy Pelosi is thought to have set a new record for the longest speech ever made in the House of Representatives, after telling the stories of immigrants for eight hours.Ms Pelosi was advocating on behalf of undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children, known as "Dreamers".She wants them protected as part of a budget deal being agreed this week.The House minority leader began her speech at 10:04 local time (15:04 GMT) - and did not finish until the evening.Dreamers were previously protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals scheme - something which was ended by President Donald Trump last year."Every day, courageous patriotic Dreamers lose their status, every day the American Dream slips further out of reach," Ms Pelosi told assembled lawmakers."As members of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect Dreamers who are the pride of our nation and are American in every way but on paper."She then shared dozens of personal stories from the immigrants facing deportation, effectively halting business in the House of Representatives in protest.On social media, many users pointed out that Ms Pelosi had not only spoken for many hours, but had done so while consuming only a little water - and wearing four-inch high heels.Democrat supporters and Ms Pelosi's own party members contributed to a wave of congratulatory tweets using the hashtag #GoNancyGo. Republicans, however, used the same tag to criticise the stunt as a waste of time. Pelosi is wearing four-inch heels and has only been sipping water these last five hours.— Daniella Diaz (@DaniellaMicaela) February 7, 2018

The move was not technically a filibuster. The House has different rules from the Senate that limit speaking time to prevent use of the technique.But as minority leader, Ms Pelosi had the right to speak for as long as she wished.Just seeing all of these #GoNancyGo messages. Truly very moving. But let's not lose focus of who really matters here. Thank you to our #Dreamers. And thank you to your parents for allowing us all the pleasure of having you be a part of our American family every day. #DREAMActNow— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 7, 2018

The controversy comes as Republican and Senate leaders managed to agree a two-year budget deal which they hope will avoid another government shutdown.You might also be interested in:The US government was left devoid of funding for a weekend as both sides argued over funding for specific measures - including immigration.The latest deal does not contain specific protections for Dreamers - something which many Democrats like Ms Pelosi are expected to oppose.Many fiscal conservatives on the Republican side are equally unhappy with the increased spending the new funding deal proposes.More on this story
