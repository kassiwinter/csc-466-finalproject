A White House official confirms Biden plans to announce that every adult in the U.S. will be eligible to be vaccinated by April 19. Biden will make the announcement at the White House on Tuesday following a visit to a vaccination site in Virginia.                                                                                                                                                      States have been gradually expanding eligibility beyond such priority groups as seniors and essential front-line workers.                                                                                                                                                                    Biden announced just last week that 90% of adults would be eligible for one of three approved vaccines by April 19, in addition to having a vaccination site within 5 miles (8 kilometers) of where they live.                                                                                                                    The White House official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden‘s plans before the formal announcement. CNN was first to report on Biden‘s planned announcement.
