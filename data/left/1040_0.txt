The sale price was $1,070,750.The previous owner did not know the identity of the buyer, and neither did the previous owner’s agent, according to people familiar with the transaction.“The buyer was anonymous,” a person familiar with the deal told NBC News.“It was always this mystery woman,” the person added. “I was like, ‘Is she an actress?’”The whereabouts of Maxwell, a British socialite who went into hiding after Epstein, the disgraced financier, was charged with sex trafficking last year, had remained a mystery until her Thursday arrest in the tiny rural town of about 1,600 people.The property where Ghislaine Maxwell may have been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Bradford, N.H., on July 2, 2020.NBC NewsMaxwell was charged with recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial.The 4,300-square-foot timber frame house sits on 156 acres of land, at the top of a half-mile driveway, making it an ideal location for someone looking to stay out of view.“If you’re looking for a place to hide, boy, you can’t find a better one,” a person familiar with the deal said. “It’s a lovely house on a lot of turf and it’s up a driveway that’s a little bit more than half a mile long.
