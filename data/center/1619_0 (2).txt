New Jersey Gov.         Chris Christie    and his supporters have formed a political-action committee ahead of a likely bid for president, adding a third well-known Republican figure to the fight for campaign funds among the party’s core donor class.The launch of the PAC, called Leadership Matters for America, is the clearest sign yet that Mr. Christie is running. It allows Mr. Christie to assemble a team of about a dozen staffers and fundraisers who could support a potential run for president, as well as to raise money that can be used to contribute to like-minded political candidates.          The PAC signals increased competition for the same set of large-dollar donors who have been taking calls recently from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 GOP nominee         Mitt Romney,    both of whom are considering presidential campaigns.     Like Mr. Christie, Messrs. Bush and Romney in recent years have been favorites of party leaders and the big-dollar bundlers and donors who are important in Republican campaigns. Mr. Bush recently formed two PACs aimed at tapping these donors, which instigated a flurry of fundraising activity and commitments of support.                                                 Gov. Christie has been at a financial disadvantage to other potential 2016 rivals who have newly formed or pre-existing PACs.

Saturday in Iowa, at a forum that marked the unofficial kickoff of the Republican presidential campaign, Mr. Christie obliquely referred to himself as “a candidate.”     Paperwork for the so-called leadership PAC—which can fund a potential candidate’s travel and campaign-like activities but can’t promote a specific candidate for a specific office—was filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, said Mike DuHaime, a longtime Christie political aide who will serve as the group’s senior adviser. Supporters will begin fundraising immediately, with events planned across 10 states in the next several months, Mr. DuHaime said. Mr. Christie will serve as its honorary chairman.     “We believe there’s a void right now in leadership throughout the country,” Mr. DuHaime said. “We aim to support candidates who are willing to take on tough problems and make tough decisions.”     Mr. Christie has been at a financial disadvantage to other potential 2016 rivals who have newly formed or pre-existing PACs. Mr. Bush launched both a so-called leadership PAC and an unlimited-contribution super PAC this month. Allies of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal formed a super PAC last week.     Christie supporters have discussed also forming a super PAC, though advisers said there is no immediate plan to start one. Unlike the leadership group, which has a $5,000 donation ceiling for individuals, a super PAC can take donations of unlimited size.     Mr. Christie has been relying on New Jersey’s state Republican Party to fund his political travel in January, though Mr. DuHaime said the new PAC covered expenses associated with Mr. Christie’s attendance at Saturday’s event in Des Moines, which was called the Iowa Freedom Summit.     At that forum, at least seven other potential presidential candidates tried to appeal to the activists who would be key to successful campaigns in the state’s first-in-the-nation nomination contest. Mr. Christie said he didn’t expect Iowa voters to always agree with his stances, even as he sought to prove his conservative credentials on issues such as abortion. Social conservatives have faulted the governor on issues including his record selecting judges.     “I’m sure you’ll not agree with me or any other candidate on every single issue,” Mr. Christie said. “If you want a candidate who agrees with you 100% of the time, I’ll give you one suggestion: Go home and look in the mirror.”     Still, Iowa Republicans said Mr. Christie’s Saturday appearance—his 11th trip to the state since becoming governor, he noted—shows he aims to compete for votes in the state. Messrs. Romney and Bush both skipped the Iowa event, as did Sens.         Marco Rubio    of Florida and         Rand Paul    of Kentucky.     “His presence alone demonstrated a commitment to Iowa that hasn’t been made yet by candidates who are competing in his lane,” said former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn. “He’s taking Iowa seriously, and I believe that’s appreciated.”     Mr. Christie still faces plenty of challenges, including his state’s lagging economy and his administration’s bridge lane-closure scandal that gained wide notice a year ago. But while attending inaugurations for governors this month that he supported as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, he has tacked on meetings with donors, strategists and activists in key GOP states such as Iowa and South Carolina.     “There is buzz about him,” said Connie Schmett, an Iowa lobbyist, who attended one of Mr. Christie’s private meetings in the state earlier this month.     Some attendees of the private sessions said they walked away with a fresh perspective of Mr. Christie after believing he wasn’t sufficiently conservative. “It’s a very different message than generally these people hear,” said         Matt Moore,    chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, about Mr. Christie’s meetings in the state. “With Christie, it’s about winning the election and then winning the argument.”     Mr. DuHaime declined to discuss financial targets for the PAC or any competition over donors. “We’re certainly confident on the fundraising side that there is more than enough support for this PAC,” he said. Mr. Bush’s PAC is asking for commitments to raise $500,000 to join its “national executive committee.”     Relationships that Mr. Christie cemented during his work with the governors’ group have now translated into hires for the PAC.         Phil Cox,    the RGA’s outgoing executive director, is serving as the PAC’s senior adviser. Phil Valenziano, former political director for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, will focus on its operations in that state. The RGA’s outgoing finance director, Paige Hahn, will be on the PAC’s finance team.     Ray Washburne, the Republican National Committee’s outgoing finance chairman and a major donor, will serve as the PAC’s finance chairman. James Garcia, Mr. Romney’s former field director in 2012, will be a political director there.     Some of Mr. Christie’s inner circle will have leadership roles with the PAC, including fundraisers Bill Palatucci and Cam Henderson. Matt Mowers, a former Christie aide who is the New Hampshire Republican State Committee’s outgoing director, will continue on his work in that key GOP state for the PAC.     The PAC’s mission statement says it will support those who work to overhaul entitlement spending and ensure children have access to quality education “no matter their Zip code.” Mr. Christie earned national attention for requiring public-sector workers in New Jersey pay more for their benefits, but his move to cut promised payments into the state’s pension system has faced court challenges.     “America has been a nation that has always controlled events and yet today events control us. Why? Because leadership matters,” says the PAC’s mission statement, a copy of which was made available to The Wall Street Journal. The Christie PAC was expected to have an online presence as soon as Monday.      Mr. Christie is expected to return to Iowa next month to speak at a Republican dinner near Des Moines, and he will travel to local GOP events in Illinois and New Hampshire.     —Josh Dawsey contributed to this article.
