Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Tuesday on "Tucker Carlson Tonight" that attorney Michael Cohen's set of guilty pleas may cause some trouble for President Trump, but that they are not "lethal" to his presidency.
Tucker Carlson said the fact Cohen "moved [money] apparently from Trump's accounts" to women the then-mogul allegedly had extramarital sex with is "very common" among famous people.
He asked Dershowitz if it is additionally illegal.
Dershowitz said that it is a "bad day" for Trump, but that the proceedings have not been as "deadly lethal" as some critics are portraying them.
