                                                  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the president had ‘excessive expectations.’                  Photo:            Reuters                                                                                                                                  Updated Aug. 10, 2017 11:47 am ET                      WASHINGTON—Tensions flared publicly between President      Donald Trump        and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with the president criticizing his party’s Senate leader for the failure to advance a health-care bill through the Republican-led chamber.      “Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ‘excessive expectations,’ but I don’t think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. He was referring to the GOP effort to roll back and replace parts of the former President         Barack Obama’s    2010 Affordable Care Act.      And on Thursday morning, the president wrote, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!”     The president’s tweets followed criticism from Dan Scavino Jr., Mr. Trump’s social-media director and a senior aide, who wrote on Twitter earlier Wednesday that Mr. McConnell “must have needed another 4 years—in addition to the 7 years—to repeal and replace Obamacare.”               The president’s remarks came after Mr. McConnell at an event in Kentucky this week critiqued the “artificial deadlines” set by the president in the monthslong debate over health care that were “unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating.”     “Our new president has of course not been in this line of work before and, I think, had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,” Mr. McConnell said.                     The House passed a bill to overhaul the ACA in May. But the health-care repeal push was stymied in the Senate in a dramatic, late-night vote in July, when three Republicans joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. That effectively ended the GOP’s repeal effort and dealt a blow to a longstanding campaign promise of the Republican Party.     It also led to recriminations among Republican lawmakers over the failure to advance the repeal bill—a pillar of the GOP agenda since the ACA was enacted in 2010.     Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said Wednesday that his GOP colleague Sen.         John McCain’s    recent brain-tumor diagnosis might have played a role in his decision to cast the third GOP vote against the Senate bill.     “He has a brain tumor right now. That vote occurred at 1:30 in the morning. Some of that might have factored in,” Mr. Johnson said on a radio program. A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain called those comments ”bizarre and deeply unfortunate.”     Separately, other Senate Republicans are increasingly becoming potential targets for Mr. Trump. He wrote in a tweet last month that Alaska Republican Sen.         Lisa Murkowski    “really let the Republicans, and our country, down.” She was one of the three who voted against the health-care measure.        
Related        Mr. Trump’s allies have also begun targeting Sen.         Jeff Flake    of Arizona, one of the most vulnerable Republicans of the 2018 cycle. Mr. Flake voted in favor of the health-care bill but has been critical of the president on other issues.     A group supporting Kelli Ward, who is running as a Republican to unseat Mr. Flake, announced Wednesday that it had received a $300,000 donation from         Robert Mercer,    a major donor and ally of Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Mercer didn’t respond to a request to comment.     Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
