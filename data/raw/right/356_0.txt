 Rattled by recent polling showing Mitt Romney drawing roughly even with President Obama among female voters, Democrats are making yet another hard play over "ladyparts." American Crossroads is answering back with an ad blitz of their own, also targeting women. It seems conservatives view women as more than just uteruses. Weird, right?  
This spot -- which focuses on spending and debt -- has $11 million behind it, and will air in swing states:  The ad will air on network TV stations and cable systems in eight states, with additional advertising on Pandora (internet radio) and the Big 10 and SEC networks. The state TV buys include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. According to Monday's blockbuster USA Today/Gallup poll, women have begun to gravitate toward the GOP ticket, largely due to the bread-and-butter fiscal issues highlighted in the American Crossroads ad:  As the presidential campaign heads into its final weeks, the survey of voters in 12 crucial swing states finds female voters much more engaged in the election and increasingly concerned about the deficit and debt issues that favor Romney. Democrats are targeting women with misleading scare tactics on birth control and rape. Republicans are pointing to the issues of national solvency, wage growth, jobs, and spending restraint. Which argument will prevail?
