         WASHINGTON—Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman         Chuck Grassley    (R., Iowa) on Thursday referred attorney         Michael Avenatti    and one of his clients to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, alleging that they made false statements about Justice         Brett Kavanaugh    during his Supreme Court confirmation proceedings.     Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed earlier this month after facing several allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied. Last month, in a sworn declaration published on         Twitter    and sent to the committee by Mr. Avenatti,         Julie Swetnick    alleged that Justice Kavanaugh was at a party in the early 1980s when she was gang-raped and that he tried to get women drunk at several gatherings.      Ms. Swetnick’s allegations weren’t investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the subsequent background probe requested by senators. In his referral to the Justice Department, Mr. Grassley said that committee staff interviewed 10 associates of Ms. Swetnick and sought to interview Ms. Swetnick, but that Mr. Avenatti turned down the request. The allegations haven’t been independently confirmed.          “It is ironic that Senator Grassley now is interested in investigations. He didn’t care when it came to putting a man on the SCOTUS for life,” Mr. Avenatti tweeted Thursday. “We welcome the investigation as now we can finally get to the bottom of Judge Kavanaugh’s lies and conduct. Let the truth be known.”               Mr. Avenatti has raised his profile this year as a frequent critic of President         Trump.    He also represents         Stephanie Clifford,    the former adult-film star known as Stormy Daniels, who was paid by a lawyer for Mr. Trump in October 2016 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump.     The allegations from Ms. Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti came as the Senate was investigating two separate accusations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee and preparing to hear from Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged Mr. Kavanaugh, now 53 years old, assaulted her when the two were both teenagers.      At the time, Justice Kavanaugh said he had never met Ms. Swetnick and told committee aides her allegations were a “smear campaign” against him. He was confirmed following the additional FBI investigation.                                                  Last month, Julie Swetnick alleged that Judge Kavanaugh was at a party in the early 1980s when she was gang-raped and that he tried to get women drunk at several gatherings.

Ms. Swetnick maintained that she was assaulted at a party.      It is a crime to make a false statement to committee investigators. Mr. Grassley referred the case to Justice investigators, saying that Ms. Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti provided materially false statements to Congress and obstructed a congressional committee investigation.     “For the law to work, we can’t just brush aside potential violations,” Mr. Grassley said in a statement. “I don’t take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.”     This is the second and third referral to investigators that stemmed from the Kavanaugh confirmation process. A man who told the staff of         Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse    (D., R.I.) that Justice Kavanaugh got into a fight on a boat was referred to the Justice Department when the man later recanted the allegations on social media.     —Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.
