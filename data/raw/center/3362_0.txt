WASHINGTON—Friction between President      Donald Trump        and         James Comey    resurfaced this weekend after details from the former FBI director’s book reopened the debate over Mr. Comey’s firing.In an interview with ABC News that aired Sunday night, Mr. Comey said his decision to tell Congress 11 days before the 2016 presidential election that the FBI was again examining Hillary Clinton’s emails was influenced by his belief the Democratic nominee would defeat Mr. Trump. “I don’t remember consciously thinking about that, but it must have been because I was operating in a world where         Hillary Clinton    was going to beat Donald Trump, and so I’m sure that it was a factor,” Mr. Comey told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in the exclusive interview, according to excerpts released by the network.     Mr. Comey, who is promoting the book due in stores Tuesday, also called Mr. Trump “morally unfit” to be president.          “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds,” Mr. Comey said, according to a transcript of the entire interview released by ABC.        
Related        Mr. Comey’s memoir, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” is critical of Mr. Trump, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He writes that the president is a “deeply flawed person and leader,” compares him to a Mafia boss and characterizes his presidency as a “forest fire.”     In a series of tweets Sunday morning, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey of telling lies in a “badly reviewed” book.     Mr. Trump denied seeking a personal commitment of loyalty from Mr. Comey, whom he fired in May 2017 over what he said were concerns the FBI director was doing a poor job. Democrats have said the firing amounted to an attempt to impede investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign and business associates, and Russian interference in the 2016 election.     “I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His ‘memos’ are self serving and FAKE!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.     Mr. Comey had previously testified to Congress that he had left a meeting with Mr. Trump with that impression. At the time, Mr. Trump’s supporters, including his then-personal lawyer         Marc Kasowitz,    denied that the president demanded loyalty of Mr. Comey, “in form or substance.“     In his tweets Sunday, the president also indicated he believed Mr. Comey deserved to be imprisoned for allegedly giving up classified information and lying to Congress.                                         On Monday President Trump called the raids at the office of his lawyer, Michael Cohen, a "disgrace" and a "witch hunt" and discussed the possibility of firing special counsel Robert Mueller.

The president Sunday also repeated complaints about an FBI raid on his personal lawyer,         Michael Cohen,    whose office, home and hotel room were searched Monday for records, including those related to a payment to Stephanie Clifford, a former adult-film actress known professionally as Stormy Daniels.     “Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!”     Newsletter Sign-up Notes on the News Today’s headlines, news in context, and good reads you may have missed.      Mr. Trump’s legal team has shrunk in recent weeks.         John Dowd,    the lead lawyer representing Mr. Trump in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, left the legal team partly because of the hiring of a new attorney who had been expected to take a more confrontational approach. The plan to hire that attorney, former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova, was scrapped. Mr. Trump’s team cited a conflict of interest.     Preet Bharara, who was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan until he was fired last year, said in an interview Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “I don’t think that Donald Trump has a decent understanding of what the attorney-client privilege is and how it can be pierced.”     The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office said in a Friday filing that prosecutors had undertaken a months-long investigation of Mr. Cohen for “criminal conduct” and that the seized materials largely focused on his “personal business dealings.” The case followed a referral by Special Counsel         Robert Mueller’s    office.     Ms. Daniels plans to attend a Monday court hearing on the matter, her lawyer.
