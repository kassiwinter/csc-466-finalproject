 (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) Sen. Rand Paul's Twitter feed is on fire today. On this day of Festivus, Paul is airing grievances on all things ranging from his colleague Sen. Cory Booker to the Senate cafeteria to his pesky staff who refuse to let him wear his turtleneck sweaters.
What is Festivus, you ask?
Its a holiday made up on the popular TV show "Seinfeld" by George Constanza's father, Frank, who hated the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas so much that he made up his own holiday: Festivus.
It begins with an airing of grievances. It can also include feats of strength, and of course you must also have the Festivus pole. It's a Festivus for the rest of us.
In the words of Frank Costanza (played memorably by Jerry Stiller), "I got a lot of problems with you people. Now you're gonna hear about it!"
Paul even aired a little dirty family laundry with a dig at his dad, former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, for auctioning off a vintage 1979 Chevy instead of giving it to him. 
My Dad auctioned off this car instead of giving it to me. http://t.co/WcJKiJbAcf pic.twitter.com/sArpHLKmhW — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  Read more of Paul's airing of grievances from earlier today:
Let us begin: Airing of Grievances begins …
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  Rand Paul is not a fan of "bipartisanship." In Washington, "bipartisan deal" is a synonym for "increasing our debt"
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  Oh, and by the way, there's isn't enough defense of the Constitution going on in Washington these days. One party seems to like some of the Bill of Rights. The other party, some more. Few willing to stand up for the whole thing.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  He's got beef with the Senate, starting with the cafeteria: The Senate cafeteria never has burgoo.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
Let's move on to the Senate. If you want more bipartisan cooperation, talk more not less.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
Allow more debate and amendments. Don't change the rules to run it with an iron fist.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  Rand Paul's friends don't retweet him enough: One more Festivus grievance about bipartisanship. @CoryBooker doesn't RT me enough.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  But somewhere out there, Cory Booker is listening: U, me & "feats of strength": Senate floor, name the time MT @SenRandPaul A Festivus grievance re bipartisanship. Booker doesn't RT me enough
- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013 
He's not a fan of the budget deal, or the Federal Reserve. The recent "bipartisan deal" will add 7 trillion more debt. And was hailed as an example of Washington "getting something done."
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
Fed policies make you poorer, and hurt the poor and middle class the most. Ridiculous monetary policies increase the costs of goods.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
So you can thank the Fed for your grocery and gas bills getting out or control.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  In case anyone was wondering, no feats of strength today: In response to some of your tweets, there will be no feats of strength, and I have no plans to end Festivus by wrestling with Sen. Reid.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  But let the man wear his turtlenecks! Grievance with my otherwise wonderful staff: Leave the turtleneck alone. I like it and so do viewers.
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
Too many people wearing ties on TV as it is
- Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  And a Festivus miracle may have occurred: Booker and Paul may take on the "war on drugs" in 2014. Bipartisanship! @CoryBooker how about mandatory minimum sentencing reform instead?
— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
@CoryBooker I am the Senate author of Hemp bill!
— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013  
I know. U told me last week. Here is to a 2014 where we take on the failed war on drugs RT @SenRandPaul: I'm the Senate author of Hemp bill!
— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013  Stay tuned, more to come… I still have a lot more problems with you people (Washington). I will be back later with more.
