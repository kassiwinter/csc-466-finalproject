                 | November 19, 2021 06:56 PM                 Ghislaine Maxwell, a known associate of Jeffrey Epstein, is attempting to gain access to documents in a settlement fund for the convicted pedophile's victims.       Jordana Feldman, the administrator of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, filed a letter in court Friday obtained by the Daily Beast that said she intends to "quash defendant Maxwell’s subpoena directed to her.”             The document request comes two weeks before Maxwell's criminal trial which aims to shed light on the role she allegedly played in Epstein's sex-trafficking scheme. According to her accusers, she was the procurer of the victims.

According to the documents, the fund was made available to victims who provided documentation, were interviewed by Feldman, accepted a settlement, then waived the right to any civil case against the Epstein estate and related entities. This waiver included Maxwell.       A civil case is ongoing between Maxwell, the Epstein estate, and a victim in the criminal case, Annie Farmer, who wanted to dismiss her civil case when accepting an offer from the estate.       In a letter to the court in December, Maxwell's legal team asked to see how much money was offered to Farmer, stating that the amount Farmer received from the settlement fund would be important in establishing her credibility in the trial.
