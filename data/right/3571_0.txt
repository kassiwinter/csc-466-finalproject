                                                 The Washington Times - August 27, 2012, 05:36PM                                                               	*UPDATE 8/29/12 - MSNBC’s Chris Matthews Responded to Chairman Priebus:                                                          “Nobody’s asked me to apologize,” said MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. “I was telling the truth…those ads are aimed at racial purpose,” he later added.

“That cheap shot about ‘I don’t have a problem with my birth certificate’ was awful. You are playing that little ethnic card there. You can play your games and giggle about it, but the fact is your side is playing that card.”                                                          I spoke with Chairman Priebus who responded, “I didn’t even know that this was that big of a deal. Chris…he wants to be the biggest jerk in the room. That’s fine. He can take that mantle.”                                                                                                          Priebus added, “The fact the matter is it’s only hurting his own candidate, Barack Obama, by acting like that. It just highlights the fact that these guys have no message other than being nasty. I don’t really care what he thinks or what he says. He has about ten viewers on his show. He can have them.”
