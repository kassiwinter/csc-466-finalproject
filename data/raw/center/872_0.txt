McConnell said in a Trump campaign livestream that the Obama administration didn't leave Trump "any kind of game plan for something like this." Obama administration officials quickly refuted McConnell's claim. Former Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said,"The maddening thing is Obama left them a WH office for pandemics, a literal playbook, a cabinet-level exercise, and a global infrastructure to deal with 'something like this.'" Ronald Klein, Joe Biden's former chief of staff, said, "We literally left them a 69-page Pandemic Playbook.... that they ignored And an office called the Pandemic Preparedness Office... that they abolished. And a global monitoring system called PREDICT .. that they cut by 75%." â€”Ronald Klain (@RonaldKlain) May 12, 2020"I was wrong," McConnell said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday.
