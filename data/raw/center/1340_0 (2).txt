FERGUSON, Mo.â€”Missouri National Guard soldiers sent by the governor began to arrive on a hot and humid Monday afternoon, hours after earlier policing efforts failed to quell violence related to ongoing protests.At a news briefing Monday, police and Missouri National Guard officials emphasized the limited role for the Guard. They declined to say how many soldiers had been deployed to Ferguson or say how long they would stay. A few were spotted on Ferguson's streets, but officials said their primary mission was to help secure the police command center at a nearby mall. President         Barack Obama,    commenting for the second time in a week on the shooting, said he spoke with Mr. Nixon Monday about ensuring that the National Guard will be used in a limited way. He also said that Attorney General         Eric Holder    would travel to Ferguson on Wednesday.

Jay Nixon    lifted the nighttime curfew here Monday, hours after the worst violence related to protests over the Aug. 9 police shooting of         Michael Brown,    an unarmed, 18-year-old African-American man.               The curfew was in effect between midnight and 5 a.m. on Sunday and Monday following looting and other vandalism on Friday night. But the past two nights saw violent clashes between protesters and police in the hours just before the curfew took effect.     "Last night, Ferguson, Mo., experienced a very difficult and dangerous night as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community. As long as there are vandals and looters and threats to the people and property of Ferguson, we must take action to protect our citizens," Mr. Nixon said.      He added that the National Guard's responsibilities were to provide protection and ensure the safety of the unified command center used by police and other authorities, which was the target of attacks late Sunday.

More on Ferguson Unrest           The guard will work under the direction of Col. Ron Replogle of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which still has command of the overall security operation, the governor said.     By mid-afternoon Monday, the scene along the main stretch of Ferguson remained calm into the sweltering afternoon, as temperatures neared 90 degrees.     A few hundred protesters held signs in pockets along West Florissant Avenue and on nearby streets. A handful of National Guard members could be seen in fatigues on the streets. Police confirmed that a few people were arrested outside the local McDonald's restaurant around 2:30 p.m.     Uniformed officers on foot patrol, with bunches of plastic zip ties attached to their belts, walked the sidewalks breaking up the groups, telling them to "keep moving."     At one point, a couple protesters began yelling at a group of police, but a peaceful protester whisked them away, telling them to "keep it peaceful."     One of the officers thanked her.      Having the Guard in Ferguson may appear to some to be more aggressive, but it actually allows the authorities to use less force to disrupt unrest, said Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a defense and national-security think tank.      "There's a tipping point where if you have enough troops, if you have a patrol on every corner, you can restore order very quickly," he said. "The Guard is the governor's last line of defense for civil unrest."      Governors typically use police forces for civil disturbances because they are usually better trained for such events, and they are cheaper and faster to deploy, Mr. Carter said. Police departments often have standing agreements to mutually support each other in the event of a large disturbance.      But there are also far fewer instances of rioting than of natural disaster in the U.S., so there are fewer chances for the Guard to be deployed in this way.     Meanwhile, Mr. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said on ABC's "Good Morning America" that she believes order would be restored in her city when there is justice for her son. When asked what justice looked like, Ms. McSpadden said the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot and killed her son, should be arrested and held "accountable for his actions."     The shooting is under local and federal investigation. No charges have been filed and accounts of the officer and some witnesses differ, according to police officials and representatives of Mr. Brown's family.     Downtown residents and business owners expressed skepticism Monday morning that the arrival of the National Guard would quell days of protests that repeatedly have turned violent. "If they come, the more stuff that's going to happen," said Michael Smith, a 22-years-old resident.     The city of 21,000 is about two-thirds African-American, a marked shift in recent decades from being almost exclusively white in 1970. The six-member City Council has one black representative, and the police force of 53 includes three black officers.     Many businesses remained boarded up Monday, and there was a light police presence. A McDonald's was reopened despite damage by vandals who smashed at least two plate-glass windows and prompted employees to flee to a store room for their safety, according to a police account early Monday.                                         One person was shot and seven were arrested for failing to disperse early Sunday morning in Ferguson, when an encounter between police and protesters became violent.

"I'm moving to Atlanta or Houston," she said Monday morning, walking a toddler across West Florissant to the Family Dollar store that authorities said was damaged by vandals Sunday night.     Charles and Kizzie Davis live on the avenue and opened their new business, Ferguson Burger Bar, the day before Mr. Brown's death.     "People not even from here are taking advantage of the opportunity for knucklehead kids to go out and make some foolishness," Mr. Davis, 47, said Monday.     Next door, barbershop owner Antonio Henley said three of his female employees have been staying away, worried about the violence. "But you do have to go through some rough times to get change," Mr. Henley said.     Traffic opened again in downtown Ferguson along West Florissant Avenue, the center of an hourslong running battle between heavily armed police and hundreds of protesters Sunday evening.      Police said Molotov cocktails thrown at them, and shootings throughout the neighborhood, forced them to respond with smoke devices and tear-gas canisters. Some protesters and witnesses said the police gave little chance for peaceful demonstrators at the front of the march to escape the tear gas. Police countered that they warned all protesters that any march, even peaceful, would be stopped.     Tear gas canisters also rained down on a media staging area designed to allow reporters to witness activities downtown after the start of a midnight curfew.     Reporters witnessed officers battling with crowds, including at a gas station where police may have come under gunfire. The officers apparently responded with a device that gave off a loud boom. It wasn't clear if there were injuries.     The police action began at about 8:30 p.m., shortly before hundreds of marchers reached a roadblock near a mall that housed the police command center.     At about 1 a.m. Monday, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said at press briefing that conditions at the protest site in Ferguson started to spiral out of control hours before the state-imposed midnight curfew with a shooting reported around 8:30. The shooting was followed by additional reports of shootings; he said eight people were seen with guns.     Capt. Johnson said his forces, stationed at a nearby mall, came under assault from Molotov cocktails when a protest march approached a law enforcement command center. Later, looting took place at at least four stores, according to Capt. Johnson.     He described antipolice actions as planned. "We needed to protect the good citizens of Ferguson," he told reporters.

He and other law-enforcement officials will consider new steps to promote public safety, Capt. Johnson said.     As of 1 a.m. Monday, as many as three people had been shot, but no officers reported injuries, Capt. Johnson said. There were seven or eight arrests, he added. Those arrested will face charges including "failure to disperse," Capt. Johnson said.     On Monday afternoon, Capt. Johnson told reporters the National Guard soldiers were coming "to bring peace" to Ferguson.     The city of Ferguson closed its public schools Monday on what was supposed to be the first day of class for the fall, district officials said.     The continuing unrest has become of global interest with international news crews covering it. Human-rights watchdog Amnesty International dispatched what it called a "human rights delegation" of 12 people to Ferguson from late Thursday night through Sunday to observe police and protesters, gather testimony and request meetings with officials on site, said Natalie Butz, a spokeswoman for the group.     It is not the first time Amnesty has deployed teams of observers and investigators to sites in the U.S., she said. As of Monday morning, Amnesty had only one person left on the ground. The group is planning on redeploying 10 people to Ferguson, including at least one street medic, said Jasmine Heiss, a senior Amnesty campaigner.       â€”Joe Barrett contributed to this article.
