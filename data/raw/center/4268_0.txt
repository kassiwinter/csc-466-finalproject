FUKUOKA, Japan—The Group of 20 major economies decried worsening trade tensions and their impact on global growth, with the U.S. and China locked in a protracted trade battle since negotiations fell apart a month ago.Finance ministers and central bankers fretted about the trade and geopolitical tensions and agreed to stand ready with action in case those risks intensify, according to a statement released Sunday after a weekend meeting in Japan. Their statement didn’t mention the tariffs the U.S. and China have used, though the measures and their effect weighed on the officials’ closed-door discussions. Over the weekend, the U.S. offered a prospective break in trade hostilities with China. Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    said Saturday that President         Trump    and Chinese President         Xi Jinping    would meet at the G-20 summit in Japan at the end of this month. Separately, Mr. Trump said the U.S. struck a deal with Mexico over immigration and that he would suspend punitive tariffs there.     On Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin met with China central bank chief         Yi Gang,    the first high-level meeting to discuss trade issues since the breakdown in talks. Mr. Mnuchin called the exchange candid and constructive. Mr. Yi, in a statement, urged G-20 countries to cooperate to resolve trade frictions, but made no mention of the meeting with Mr. Mnuchin.               Those announcements and actions did little to ease the worries of the officials from most of the other G-20 countries, who expressed increasing concern that the U.S. tariffs are taking a toll on the global economy.     “It is high time that we put an end to trade tensions that today are weighing on growth,” French Finance Minister         Bruno Le Maire    said in closing remarks to reporters Sunday. “All of our debates made clear the very big preoccupation on the risk of a trade war linked to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.”     Japanese Finance Minister         Taro Aso    called on countries to consider how their trade policies impact a wider web of trade relations, instead of targeting any one country. ”It is difficult to talk about trade unless we see it multilaterally,” he said in a press conference.     The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have all cut global growth forecasts and flagged weakening investment in recent months. The IMF estimates that tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China alone could reduce the size of the global economy next year by about $455 billion, or 0.5%. It expects the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2020.     Tensions between the U.S. and China have ticked up since their talks foundered in early May over Trump administration accusations that Beijing was backsliding. Since then, both governments have raised tariffs on each country’s goods, the U.S. has restricted technology transfers and Beijing has warned of doing something similar.     For most of the weekend in the southern city of Fukuoka, finance and central bank leaders wrangled over how to describe trade tensions for their public statement.     A Japanese finance official said the countries took a long time before agreeing to describe trade tensions as having “intensified.” He said that Japan fought successfully to include a call for countries to consider services in addition to goods, a veiled message for the U.S. to focus less on its trade deficit.     Agreeing on a communiqué wasn’t a given—members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization failed to issue a communiqué late last year for the first time in its nearly three-decade history.     The U.S. was at odds with most countries on how tariffs have impacted global growth and how to resolve trade conflicts between countries, according to officials. In a briefing Saturday, Mr. Mnuchin echoed President Trump and denied that trade tensions were causing a global slowdown. Instead he said some countries would enjoy a “big boom,” as firms moved production out of China.     U.S. officials had to check with Washington overnight Saturday on what language would be acceptable for the statement, according to a person familiar with the matter, and then discussions picked up midday Sunday.     “All the other parties really wish to go back to multilateral negotiations,” instead of having to weather U.S. tariffs, the person said. “There’s this unanimous feeling that this is derailing global growth.”     The final communiqué, released at the end of the two-day meeting, made vague reference to those complaints, avoiding any direct mention of “tariffs” and of the U.S. and China.     “Growth remains low” and “trade and geopolitical tensions have intensified,” said the statement. “We will continue to address these risks, and stand ready to take further action.”     The statement didn’t elaborate on how governments would respond if conditions get worse.     IMF Managing Director         Christine Lagarde,    who attended the meeting, urged countries to eliminate tariffs and avoid new ones. “The first priority should be to resolve the current trade tensions,” she said in a statement Sunday.     —Alastair Gale contributed to this article.
