Police in Seattle said one person was wounded in a second shooting in the city’s protest zone in less than 48 hours.The shooting happened late on Sunday night in the area near Seattle’s downtown area known as Chaz, for “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone”, and involved a 17 year old, who later declined to speak with detectives.Police tweeted that one person was at a hospital with a gunshot wound. The person arrived in a private vehicle and was in serious condition, Harborview Medical Center spokesperson Susan Gregg said in a statement.A pre-dawn shooting on Saturday had left a 19-year-old man dead and a 33-year-old man critically injured. Both victims, whose identities had not yet been released, were transported to the same hospital via private car. The suspect or suspects in that first shooting fled the scene, and no arrests had been made as of Sunday, Detective Mark Jamieson said.According to a police blog, officers responding to the shooting said they “were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers’ safe access to the victims”.Video released by police appeared to show officers arriving at the protest zone saying they wanted to get to the victim and entering as people yelled that the victim was already gone. Police mostly retreated from the zone after clashes with protesters, KIRO-TV reported.Chaz is a several-block area cordoned off by protesters near a police station in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, which evolved after weeks of protests in the city over police brutality and racism, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.0Inside Chaz, Seattle's police-free zone: 'We're proving the world can change' – videoDonald Trump, a Republican, has criticized Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington governor Jay Inslee, both Democrats, for allowing the zone.It wasn’t immediately clear where within the zone Sunday night’s shooting took place. The Seattle fire department arrived at the scene at 10.46pm and went to a staging area near the zone’s perimeter, fire department spokesperson David Cuerpo told the Seattle Times.The fire department was soon notified that the injured person has already been taken away.Volunteer medics inside the zone brought the victim to the hospital rather than waiting for the police and fire departments.“To ensure the safety of medical personnel, police staged with Seattle Fire at the edge of the CHOP area and were gathering information about where the shooting victim was located when they learned he had been transported in a private vehicle to Harborview Medical Center,” police said in a blog post Monday.The 17-year-old was treated and released, the department said. Investigators asked anyone with information about the shooting to come forward.Further details about what transpired Sunday night weren’t immediately available. It wasn’t clear whether anyone was in custody.
