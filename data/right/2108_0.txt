                                                                                                                                         Somalia-based terrorist group al-Shabab, an al Qaeda offshoot, released a recruitment video Saturday showing what it calls racial injustice in the U.S. and featuring clips of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.                                                                                                                                                      The 51-minute video shows a clip of Mr. Trump at a rally in December where he called for the U.S. to ban all Muslims from entering the country as his supporters cheered, according to reports from the SITE Intelligence Group.                                                                                                                                                      The image of the real estate mogul was sandwiched between two clips of al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in 2011, saying Muslims in the U.S. would have to choose between leaving for other Islamic countries or staying at home to fight Western forces, Business Insider reported.                                                                                                                                                                    The video was distributed on Twitter on Friday by Islamist militant organization al-Kataib, SITE reported.                                                                                                                              Mr. Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. has prompted harsh criticism worldwide.                                                                                                                                                       Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton claimed that clips of Mr. Trump spouting his anti-Muslim rhetoric were used in Islamic State propaganda videos. However, that claim has never been proved and the video was created by an offshoot of the Islamic State group’s rival, al Qaeda.
