Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who says he has "credible information" about more sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said Monday that he expects his new client will appear for an on-camera interview within the next 48 hours.Avenatti told The Hill that he anticipates his client will go public with her accusation against Kavanaugh in a television interview within the next two days."We anticipate that that is what is going to occur," Avenatti said, confirming an earlier report from Politico.He said he does not know which media outlet she will appear on, adding, "We have not finalized the details."Avenatti is representing adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump and his former lawyer Michael Cohen. Now, Avenatti is entering the fray surrounding Kavanaugh's roiled Supreme Court nomination with a tweet announcing he is representing "a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh." Avenatti on Sunday tweeted a screenshot of an email he sent to Mike Davis, the chief counsel for nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the email, Avenatti said he is "aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the early 1980s, during which Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge and others would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol/drugs to allow a 'train' of men to subsequently gang rape them.""There are multiple witnesses that will corroborate these facts and each of them must be called to testify publicly," Avenatti wrote.Avenatti has declined to disclose most of the details about his client, though he told Politico that "she's had multiple security clearances over the years, including public trust and secret security clearance."Avenatti's client would be the third woman to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Christine Blasey Ford last week went public with her allegation that Kavanaugh pinned her down during a high school party in 1982 and attempted to forcibly remove her clothes. She named Judge as the other person in the room during the alleged assault.Judge has denied his presence during the alleged incident.Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, told The New Yorker in an article published Sunday that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a dorm-room party without her consent when the two were college students at Yale University in the 1980s.Kavanaugh has forcefully denied both accusations.Ford and Kavanaugh are set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
