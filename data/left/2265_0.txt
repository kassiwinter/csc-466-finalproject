“The legislation did not come up in the bilateral meeting," Ben Rhodes said during a press briefing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The White House has recently threatened to veto the bill, which it said would jeopardize already strained relations with the U.S.' strategic regional ally and put Americans at "significant risk" if other countries pass similar laws. Saudi officials warned that the country would sell off millions in American assets if the bill is signed into law. Rhodes reiterated those concerns Thursday.
"My sense is that the Saudis are aware of the position that we’re taking on the legislation, so it’s not as if they needed to spend a lot of time addressing with us," he said. "So it wasn’t a subject at the bilat even as obviously there have been many statements about it over the last several days.”
At the center of the issue are 28 pages of the Joint Congressional Inquiry that remain classified and could shed light on the role of foreign governments in the plot that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
"The president has asked for this declassification review," Rhodes said. "We have been deferential to the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] in leading that review, and when that's done, we'd expect there'll be some degree of declassification that provides some information."
