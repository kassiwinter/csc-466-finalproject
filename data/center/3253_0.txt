Even more — 77 percent — place blame on Congress.But most Americans fault a failure to identify and treat mental illness as the primary driver for such shootings. Fifty-seven percent said so, compared to just 28 percent who blame inadequate gun control laws. The poll results came days after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., about 25 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale, left 17 people dead and 14 others injured. The shooting reignited the national debate over gun control and mental health screening and treatment. In the wake of the attack, students from the school have become some of the most vocal advocates for restricting gun access.According to the new Washington Post–ABC News poll, 77 percent of respondents believe that the attack could have been prevented by more effective mental health screening and treatment.The poll also found that Americans remain starkly divided on whether to implement a new ban on assault weapons. About 50 percent said that they would support a ban, while 46 percent would oppose one.The accused shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the high school, allegedly carried out the attack with an AR-15, an assault-style rifle that he bought legally from a dealer in nearby Coral Springs roughly a year ago.The Washington Post–ABC News poll of 808 adults was conducted from Feb. 15 to 18. Its margin of error is 4 percentage points.
