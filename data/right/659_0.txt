                                                                                                                                         Seizing on one of the  biggest shopping days of the year, the White House tried to exert  pressure on Republican lawmakers Monday by warning that  consumer  spending could drop by nearly $200 billion in 2013 if Congress  fails  to approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class by the  end of  next month.                                                                                                                                                      The White House released a report from the National  Economic Council and the Council of Economic Advisers analyzing the  impact on retailers if taxes go up on Jan. 1 for families earning less  than $250,000 per year. The report said that allowing middle-class tax  rates to rise and failing to pay for a short-term “patch” of the  Alternative Minimum Tax could cut the growth of consumer spending by  1.7 percentage points in 2013.                                                                                                                                                      “The president believes  Democrats and  Republicans should come together to renew middle-class  tax cuts so  families and businesses have more certainty at this  critical time for  our economy,” the White House said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                    The  CEA  estimated that consumers could spend nearly $200 billion less  next  year just because of higher taxes, about four times the amount that   shoppers spent during the “Black Friday” weekend in 2011. The   administration timed the release of the report for “Cyber Monday,” the   biggest online shopping day of the year, when retailers offer heavy   discounts for shoppers on the Web, particularly on electronics.                                                                                                                              The  administration’s release of the report seemed a calculated effort to   build support for President Obama’s position in negotiations with   Congress to avert the so-called “fiscal cliff,” a mix of tax increases   and automatic spending cuts due to take effect in January. Mr. Obama is  urging lawmakers first to approve an extension of tax cuts for the   middle class and to address tax rates for wealthier families later.   That approach could mean an automatic tax increase on Jan. 1 for   households earning more than $250,000.                                                                                                                                                                 “While the president is  committed to working with Congress to reach  compromises on areas of  disagreement, there is no reason to delay acting where everyone agrees:  extending tax cuts for the middle-class,” said a statement from the  office of White House press secretary Jay Carney. “There is no reason  to hold the middle-class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the  highest income earners.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lawmakers in both parties said Sunday that  they expect to reach at least a stopgap deal with the White House  before the end of the year.                                                                                                                   “I think it’s likely that there will be a  solution — not a final  solution by any means, and not a big solution —  but will get us through the end of the year into next year with a  plan for trying to deal with these issues long-term over the course of the next Congress,” Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN.  “That will require compromise.”
