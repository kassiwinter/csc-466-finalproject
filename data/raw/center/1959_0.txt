Global stocks and commodity prices plunged Monday, as last week’s meltdown in financial markets intensified.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly fell more than 1000 points—its biggest ever one-day point decline on an intraday basis—before recovering to trade 194 points lower, or 1.3%, at 16265. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, while the         Nasdaq    Composite Index was down 0.9%. The Dow entered a correction on Friday, falling 10% from its recent peak, following its worst week since 2011.     Monday’s moves came after a sharp selloff in Chinese shares accelerated, wiping out gains for the year. Oil prices fell by around 4%, while investors headed for relatively safe assets such as U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note recently was 2.025%, having dipped below 2% for the first time since April.               Fears that China’s economy is slowing dramatically sparked the heavy selling around the globe in recent days. Beijing’s unexpected move to devalue its currency two weeks ago raised the alarm that the world’s second-largest economy may be in worse shape than many had thought. Since then, weak economic data have fueled worries that a drop-off in Chinese growth could cause a global slowdown.     The Shanghai Composite sank 8.5%, entering negative territory for 2015, having risen as much as 60% to its June peak. Japan’s Nikkei benchmark tumbled 4.6%.        
Related        Investors were further rattled Monday by the lack of fresh steps to stem the selloff over the weekend from Chinese authorities. The Wall Street Journal reported that the central bank was preparing to flood the banking system with liquidity to increase lending, the latest in a series of measures designed to boost the economy.          The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 closed 5.3% lower, the biggest one-day decline since December 2008. The index is now sightly lower so far in 2015, after a massive rally sparked by the European Central Bank’s stimulus program melted away.      Germany’s DAX fell 4.7% and has now lost more than 20% since its April peak, meaning the index has entered a so-called bear market. Germany’s stock market, which contains many car makers and industrial firms with a big chunk of their sales in China, has been among the worst-hit by the recent selloff.      The U.K.’s FTSE fell 4.7% to its lowest close since late 2012.                                                 Investors monitor stock data on an electronic board at a securities brokerage house in Beijing on Monday.

Basic resources companies on the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 9.3%.     The speed of the recent selloff has left investors nervous.     “Most obviously this is about China and the risk of a financial system crisis there. But sometimes the market organism takes over and develops a logic of its own,” said         Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen,    head of multiasset strategy at NN Investment Partners, which has about €184 billion ($209.5 billion) in assets under management.     The firm is more cautiously positioned, with more cash in its portfolios, than at any time in the past four years, Mr. van Nieuwenhuijzen said.     Investors are increasingly skeptical that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting next month, amid growing turmoil in global markets and falling inflation expectations.          Fed-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central bank policy, showed Monday that they see a 28% likelihood of a rate increase in September, according to data from the         CME Group.    The probability was nearly halved from a week ago.     “We’ve got intense weakness in commodities and emerging markets as well as general concerns about global growth,” said Nick Gartside, head of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which manages $1.8 trillion of assets.      A Fed rate rise in September would be “a very courageous call,” he said.     The steep drops in European and Japanese stock markets helped fuel a dollar selloff against other major currencies.     Many U.S. investors who held equities in those markets made negative euro and yen trades against the dollar to shield themselves against swings in those currencies. As they sell their Japanese and eurozone stocks they unwind these trades, effectively buying the euro or yen against the dollar.     “Every time markets drop, investors must rebalance, and the dollar is being dragged down as a result,” said         Paresh Upadhyaya,    director of currencies at Pioneer Investments.     The euro was recently up 1.7% against the dollar at $1.1579, having hit its highest level since January. The dollar was down 2.8% against the yen at ¥118.65, after reaching the lowest point for the currency pair since February.     However, commodity-linked currencies fell sharply against the dollar despite the buck’s broader weakness.     The Australian dollar slid more than 2% against the U.S. dollar to levels last seen in 2009, before rebounding slightly. Russia’s ruble slumped 2.5% to trade at around 71 against the dollar. South Africa’s rand fell nearly 3% during the European trading session, briefly hitting a record low of 14.48 against the dollar.     Worries over China continued to hit commodities. Brent crude oil dropped 4.9% to $43.25 a barrel, below the $45 a barrel mark for the first time since March 2009. The U.S. benchmark fell 3.8% to $38.90.     Copper prices fell to the lowest level since July 2009. Aluminum also hit a six-year low, while zinc and lead prices both hit five-year lows.     —Josie Cox in London and Min Zeng and Ira Iosebashvili in New York contributed to this article.
