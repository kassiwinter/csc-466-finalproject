         DUBAI—Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah         Ali Khamenei    declared Thursday there was no guarantee of a final deal over Tehran’s nuclear program, saying world powers led by the U.S. couldn’t be trusted to negotiate in good faith.     “There has been nothing done and there is nothing binding,” Mr. Khamenei said in his eagerly awaited response to the framework nuclear agreement struck in Switzerland last week between Iran and world powers led by the U.S. “I neither agree nor disagree.”      Mr. Khamenei, who has the final say on most matters of state in Iran, didn’t rule the possibility an accord would be reached by June 30, the deadline set by negotiators to work out the details of an agreement under which the Islamic republic would limit its nuclear activities in exchange for an easing of international sanctions.      At the same time, he stopped short of endorsing a deal in remarks that reflected the wariness he and other Iranian hard-liners have over the complex negotiations yet to come and skepticism about any deal with the U.S.               “Everything done so far neither guarantees an agreement in principle nor its contents, nor does it guarantee that the negotiations will continue to the end,” Mr. Khamenei said in a speech broadcast on state television and in remarks published on his website.                                          Softer relations between Iran and the U.S. could mean a cloudy future for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Iranian hard-liners opposed to any rapprochement with the West could jeopardize a final deal, as could members of U.S. Congress who doubt Iran would adhere to an agreement.      Mr. Khamenei’s comments on Thursday appeared carefully parsed. While his skepticism was seen by some Iranians as an attempt to appease the hard-liners, he was also careful not to undermine moderate President         Hasan Rouhani    and his team of nuclear negotiators led by Foreign Minister         Javad Zarif.         “I have never doubted the executors of the nuclear talks, but I have serious concerns about the nuclear talks,” he said.     With an eye on the hard bargaining yet ahead, Mr. Khamenei said Iran wouldn’t agree to inspections of its military facilities and declared that all economic sanctions on Iran had to be removed “on the day of the deal.”     The White House said Monday that the U.S. position was for sanctions to be removed gradually.     Mr. Khamenei also said Iran’s support for its regional allies wasn’t negotiable. Tehran currently backs the Shiite Lebanese movement Hezbollah and Syrian President         Bashar al-Assad    and his embattled government.     “Our support for our resisting brothers in different places should not be disturbed throughout the talks,” he said.              Ray Takeyh,    a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there has been more agreement than disagreement in Iran with the framework deal, with most of country’s political elite favoring it.      But Mr. Khamenei’s negative comments could give political cover to skeptics who have so far been restrained, he said.     “We will see if this [support] lasts given Khamenei’s expressions today,” he said.
