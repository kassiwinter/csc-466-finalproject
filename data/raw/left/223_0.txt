  ThomasRomney came out as the aggressor and it paid off in perception. On the other hand, he reversed his positions from the last 8 months, he dragged out debunked lies about 718billion, he still didn't provide more detail on his tax plan, he still didn't provide more detail on his healthcare reform post repealing obamacare and every factual rebuttal Obama had was a lie because he just hadn't released the details yet.
Jim, you are a terrible moderator. You are. You let Mitt continue on talking while having a meltdown at the end of the first section. 'Now onto the next top..."..."NO NO NO I NEED TO RESPOND NOW". Then he threatened to defund your lively hood and you sat there like a wimp. Then CNN's fact checking? Well, if we take Romney at his work from tonight on his tax plan as opposed to what he said last night and for his earlier campaign and what he says on his website, then Obama is completely wrong. Really? Shut off the TV at that point. Romney surprised a lot, he was the aggressor and it will pay dividends for him. Obama looked like he was falling asleep most of the time though.
