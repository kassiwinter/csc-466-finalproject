Fox News has issued an apology to teen climate activist Greta Thunberg after a guest on one of the network’s shows called her “mentally ill.”Conservative political commentator and podcast host Michael Knowles was on “The Story” Monday night in a segment about meatless diets and its impact on the environment.“None of that matters because the climate hysteria movement is not about science,” Knowles said in a viral clip. “If it were about science, it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.”Fox News confirmed to USA TODAY Tuesday that the network doesn’t plan on booking Knowles in the future.Viral video:Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg sets stare on Donald Trump at UN“The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful – we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers,” a spokesperson for Fox News said in a statement.Knowles is the host of the podcast “The Michael Knowles Show” on The Daily Wire.
