Cornell University is one of 10 schools being investigated by the the Education Department and Trump administration.(Getty Stock Images)Colleges and universities previously failed to report upward of $6.5 billion in gifts from China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other foreign countries, an ongoing investigation by the Trump administration uncovered. Ten schools, including Cornell University, Yale University, the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Boston University, Texas A&M University, and Carnegie Mellon University, accounted for half of that figure, disclosing $3.6 billion in previously unreported foreign gifts."This is about transparency," Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. "If colleges and universities are accepting foreign money and gifts, their students, donors, and taxpayers deserve to know how much and from whom. Moreover, it's what the law requires."Editorial Cartoons on EducationDepartment officials announced Wednesday that they're initiating new investigations into both Harvard University and Yale University after the Ivy League schools appear to have failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign gifts and contracts.Yale may have failed to report at least $375 million, department officials said, choosing not to report any gifts and contracts over the last four years. And in the case of Harvard, department officials said they're concerned it lacks the ability to provide rigorous oversight and tracking of foreign money – this in the wake of the indictment of the school's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department chair for lying about his involvement with the Thousand Talents Plan, the Chinese government's overseas recruitment mission of high-level researchers and scientists.Section 117 of the Higher Education Act requires colleges and universities that receive federal aid to report gifts from, and contracts with, any foreign source that exceed $250,000 in value and to disclose any foreign ownership or control twice each year. Fewer than 300 of the approximately 6,000 U.S. colleges and universities report receiving foreign money each year, according to the Education Department. While the majority of that money is funneled to 50 large institutions, a 2019 report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said those schools "routinely" fail to comply with the law, describing foreign spending on U.S. colleges and universities as "a black hole.""Unfortunately, the more we dig, the more we find that too many are underreporting or not reporting at all," DeVos said. "We will continue to hold colleges and universities accountable and work with them to ensure their reporting is full, accurate, and transparent, as required by the law."For example, from January 2012 to June 2018, 15 colleges and universities reported receiving $15.5 million from Hanban, the headquarters of Confucius Institutes, which are schools and programs funded by the Chinese government that commonly teach language and culture but are controlled by high-ranking officials in Beijing and widely considered a propaganda machine.But when Senate investigators requested financial records from 100 U.S. schools, it found that Hanban had actually contributed $113 million to U.S. schools during that time period – more than seven times the amount originally reported."The largest colleges and universities are multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue that is intermingled with domestic sources of funding from tuition, grants, and the like," Education Department officials told Congress in a preliminary report on the agency's investigation."These colleges and universities actively solicit foreign governments, corporations, and nationals for funds although some donors are known to be hostile to the United States and may be seeking to project 'soft power,' steal sensitive and proprietary research and development data and other intellectual property, and spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments," they said.
