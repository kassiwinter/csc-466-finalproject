           President Donald Trump called on lawmakers Monday to pass legislation requiring strong background checks for firearm purchases in the wake of mass shooting in Texas and Ohio over the weekend that killed 29 people.
Trump, who was scheduled to deliver remarks at the White House later Monday morning, tweeted that "we cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them, and those many who came before them."
He said Republicans and Democrats "must come together and get strong background checks" for gun buyers, and linked his plea to his push for "desperately needed immigration reform. "
"We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!" he concluded.
The Democrat-led House has passed a gun control bill that includes fixes to the nation's firearm background check system, but it has languished in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Trump later Monday morning took aim at the media, blaming "fake news" for fueling "anger and rage" in the nation: "The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!
