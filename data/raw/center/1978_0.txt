Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said Sunday she would vote to support the Iran nuclear deal.Although she said she still has some concerns, Ms. Wasserman Schultz told CNN’s "State of the Union" that the deal’s opponents had provided no evidence that an alternative plan, such as applying economic pressure to force Iran back to the negotiating table, would work. “In weighing all the information that I had in front of me, I concluded that the best thing to do is to vote in support of the Iran deal,” she said, “and make sure that we can put Iran years away from being a threshold nuclear state and make sure that we can more closely concentrate on their terrorist activities.”     She said intelligence officials have assured her “in no uncertain terms” Iran will not be allowed to use its own inspectors to certify compliance with the deal.          Last week, Mr. Obama secured enough votes in the Senate to allow him to implement the pact.                                                 Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D., Fla.) speaks with Vice President Joe Biden at the David Posnack Jewish Community Center in Davie, Fla., Thursday.

I am confident that the process I’ve gone through to reach this decision is one that will ensure that Israel will be there forever.”     The White House was closely watching the decision of Ms. Wasserman Schultz. As a leading Jewish lawmaker and head of the DNC, her vote is seen as influential with other Democrats.     Ms. Wasserman Schultz said she spoke with President Barack Obama Saturday night and he assured her she would be part of a group of members in Congress working with the administration to develop an enhanced security package for Israel, as well as “tightening our ability to enforce this deal.”     “That’s critical for me,” she said.     Many Jewish lawmakers have struggled in recent weeks over whether or not to support the deal. Vice President Joe Biden met with Jewish leaders in South Florida last week urging them to support the deal, which he said would put the U.S. in a stronger position to address concerns from Israel and the Arab states about Iran’s behavior in the region.     Former Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking on Fox News Sunday, attacked the Iran agreement as a “major, major defeat in my mind in terms of our position in the region.”     Mr. Cheney in a new book compares the deal to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the leadup to World War II. Asked by host Chris Wallace if that was an appropriate comparison, Mr. Cheney said “yes.”     “If you look at what happened, with respect to the Iranian deal, the only winner are the Iranians, and they got everything they asked for,” he said. “The overall outcome I think will be to shift significantly the balance of power in that part of the world. The Iranians, I think, they’ll end up dominating... because of the nuclear deal but also because of the lifting of the embargo on ballistic missiles and on conventional weapons.”     Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Colin Powell called the Iran agreement “a pretty good deal” on NBC’s "Meet the Press" Sunday.     Though opponents of the deal argue it would be “leaving open a lane” for Iran to rev up its nuclear program in the future, Mr. Powell said, “we’re forgetting the reality that they have been on a superhighway for the last 10 years to create a nuclear weapon…with no speed limit.”     He called the changes agreed to under the deal “remarkable.”     “We have stopped this highway race that they were going down, and I think that’s very, very important,” he said.

Here are three ways the continuing spat could lead to more tensions with Iran.
