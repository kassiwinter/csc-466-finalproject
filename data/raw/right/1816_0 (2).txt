Jeb Bush blasted the Obama administration on Saturday for limiting religious freedom. He added that “the Christian voice” isn’t heard enough in the world during his commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.                                                                                                                                                      The likely 2016 GOP candidate condemned President Obama during his commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia for using “coercive federal power” to squash religious freedom and accused the administration of “demanding obedience in complete disregard of religious conscience,” The Associated Press reported.                                                                                                                                                      “Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,” Mr. Bush said to an estimated 34,000 gathered for the graduation ceremony at the university’s football stadium.                                                                                                                                                                    “How strange, in our own time, to hear Christianity spoken as some sort of backward and oppressive force,” Mr. Bush said, AP reported. “Your generation is bringing the Christian voice to where it always is needed, and sometimes isn’t heard enough.”                                                                                                                              Mr. Bush, a converted Catholic, will face tough competition in a crowd of GOP hopefuls that hold more sway with the Christian community.                                                                                                                                                                 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz formally announced his candidacy at Liberty University last month and Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist pastor, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have all made their Christian faith a centerpiece of prospective campaigns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr. Bush also tried to appeal to non-Christians as well.                                                                                                                   “In my experience, at least, you generally find the same good instincts, fair-mindedness, and easygoing spirit among Americans of every type — including, of course, the many who belong to no church at all,” Mr. Bush said, AP reported.
