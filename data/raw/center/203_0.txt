Political Wisdom’s morning edition rounds up the most important reads from the Journal and other publications, plus runs down early headlines. Follow our coverage on Twitter @WSJwashington. President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney meet in Denver for their first debate starting at 9 p.m. ET. In a preview, Mr. Romney releases his second face-the-camera television ad. "We should measure our compassion by how many Americans are able to get good paying jobs," he says. And Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, tries to shoot down the Republican's attacks ahead of time. "Romney can use tonight's debate to fill in those details and finally, for the first time, explain his proposals or readjust his positions," she says in a memo. "Or he can spend 90 minutes doing what he does best: attacking the president."     Key Reads:           President Barack Obama heads into tonight's debate with a 49% to 46% lead nationally among likely voters, Neil King Jr. and I write in dissecting the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. "Mr. Romney's challenge as he prepares for the first of three debates is whether he can chip into Mr. Obama's strongholds, particularly women," the story says. "The question for Mr. Obama is whether he can translate his support among Hispanics, the young and African-Americans into actual votes, while minimizing the erosion of support for him among white voters."     Meantime, Mr. Romney has narrowed the race since early September in Virginia and Florida, but continues to lose ground in Ohio, one of the biggest battlegrounds on the map, Sara Murray writes in today's Journal on the latest round of WSJ/NBC News/Marist Poll surveys of swing states. Mr. Obama leads 47% to 46% in Florida, 48% to 46% in Virginia and 51% to 43% in Ohio, up slightly from a seven-point lead last month. Mr. Romney can put together 270 electoral votes without Ohio, but the path is narrow. "A major challenge there: More than half of likely Ohio voters—some 51%—had an unfavorable impression of Mr. Romney, compared with 42% who viewed him positively," Ms. Murray writes. "It was roughly the opposite for the president: 52% viewed Mr. Obama favorably, while 44% had a negative impression of him."     Despite having a cash-on-hand advantage, Mr. Romney and his allies are still being outspent on TV by the president and his backers, Jim Rutenberg and Jeremy W. Peters write in the New York Times. That may not hold for long, as the Republican is in the midst of upping his ad buys in several key states, ad trackers have said this week. Still, some Republicans this year have worried that its partly because of the way the Romney campaign purchases ads -- using a small in-house team and often by purchasing ads at the last minute. Mr. Obama, by contrast, has bough ads well ahead of time and uses an outside firm to reserve time. In Florida during the last two weeks of September, "The number of pro-Obama ads outnumbered pro-Romney ads by almost 50 percent — some 13,000 of them accusing Mr. Romney of outsourcing jobs to China, trying to gut Medicare and hiding his tax returns from the public," the two write.     And Mr. Romney got a little more specific with his tax plan, suggesting to a Denver TV station that he would cap "the total number of deductions available to a middle-class family at $17,000. He also said the cap on deductions for wealthier Americans could be less than that figure," Damian Paletta writes in the Journal. The suggested revenue-raiser appears to be part of an effort to explain to voters how Mr. Romney would pay for big cuts to marginal tax rates.     Top Opinion and Op-Eds:     Mr. Romney would be wise not to play it safe tonight, and should instead go bold and embrace conservative principles, Fred Barnes writes in a Journal op-ed. "Mr. Romney should do in the debate what he hasn't done in his speeches, media appearances or TV ads—in other words, in his entire campaign. He must make a forceful case that America's survival as a prosperous and respected nation is at stake," writes the executive editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. "The Republican challenger needs to go where Mr. Obama cannot go. What's required are ideas, initiatives and policies commensurate with America's moment of peril. This means, first of all, embracing the conservative reform agenda: entitlement reform, overhaul of the tax code, curbs on spending, an unhampered economy, regulatory relief, consumer-driven health care, a welfare state that doesn't promote dependency, a revitalized civil society." Conservatives have been making similar arguments since Mr. Romney has been running for president, and the advice is likely to continue as long as Mr. Romney trails in the polls.     If USA Today's editorial board moderated tonight's debate, its top question for the president would be: "Shortly before you took office, your economic advisers projected that if Congress passed a major stimulus bill, the unemployment rate would stay below 8%. The bill passed, but the jobless rate quickly topped 8% and peaked at 10%. In fact, it hasn't been below 8% during your presidency. Did you underestimate the problem, or did you oversell the stimulus?     And for Mr. Romney: "You want to extend the Bush tax cuts and reduce rates an additional 20%, while ending the estate tax, lowering corporate taxes and more. You say you'd make up the revenue loss by closing loopholes, but you and your running mate, Paul Ryan, have repeatedly refused to say which ones. The tax breaks big enough to do the trick include those for employer-paid health insurance, mortgage interest, state and local taxes, dividends and interest, and charitable donations. Don't you owe it to voters to tell them what they stand to lose, not just what they'd gain?     House race expert Stuart Rothenberg writes in Roll Call that pundits may be hyperventilating when they suggest that control of the House of Representatives is now "in play." Democrats and Republicans who have suggested Democrats could retake the lower chamber point to Mr. Romney's standing in the polls and Democratic gains in key Senate races. "After looking at all of the individual district polls, those made public as well as dozens that have not been released for public consumption, and talking with both Democratic and Republican insiders whose main interest is understanding exactly what is happening rather than regurgitating the party line, I see little evidence that Democrats are close to gaining the 25 seats they need to win control of the House," Mr. Rothenberg writes.     Last Word:     Some officials in San Francisco think residents are seeing too much skin, Geoffrey A. Fowler and Vauhini Vara write on the front page of the Journal. "A city supervisor here proposed a law Tuesday that would ban nudity in most public places across the city," they say. "For years, the city has held an 'equilibrium' with nudity at public events and occasionally in neighborhoods, said the supervisor, Scott Wiener, but the nudity recently 'has just gotten extreme.'"
