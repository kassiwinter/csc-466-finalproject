The economic recovery has downshifted, with job growth slowing and layoffs persisting at a high level amid rising coronavirus cases and related restrictions. The level of applications was the highest since September, but still well down from a peak of nearly seven million in late March. The number of applications for a separate federal pandemic program also rose sharply last week.          The claims figures add to signs the recovery continues, but at a cooler pace. Job growth eased in November and the number of job openings edged down in early December. The labor market’s partial rebound has been a key component in the overall economic recovery from a pandemic-related downturn in the spring.               Consumer spending rose in October for the sixth straight month, though at a slower pace, according to the Commerce Department. The manufacturing and services sectors expanded in November, according to the Institute for Supply Management.     U.S. stocks fell Thursday after the unemployment-claims figures were released.     Jobless claims have mostly trended down since the spring, when the pandemic caused widespread business restrictions. Since falling below 1 million claims a week in August, the pace of improvement slowed.      Claims had held between 700,000 and 800,000 a week since mid-October, before jumping up last week. Economists caution that week-to-week data can be volatile around holiday periods.     “We’re seeing a cooling trend in the labor market, with rising layoffs,” said         Nela Richardson,    chief economist at human-resources software firm         Automatic Data Processing Inc.              Ms. Richardson said a return to net monthly jobs losses this winter “can’t be ruled out if we’re seeing a surging pandemic causing states to take steps to roll back the reopening process.” However, she added that increased federal stimulus and an expedient rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine could support job growth.     Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this month cut their projections for economic growth and job creation in the first quarter of 2021, but they expect the expansion to accelerate later in the year after coronavirus vaccines are more widely available.     Thursday’s unemployment-claims report showed jobless applications increased in most states, led by populous places such as California, Illinois, Texas and Virginia.     Jobless-claims data have been viewed as a bellwether for economists and policy makers for a half-century. However, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, last month said jobless claims data was flawed.     The GAO said states have provided inconsistent data to the Labor Department and incidents of fraud have distorted the numbers. The Labor Department on Thursday said the measurement of ongoing benefits, known as continuing claims, reflects “a good approximation” of the number of insured unemployed workers receiving benefits.     That number rose by 230,000 to 5.8 million in the week ended Nov. 28. State programs provide unemployment insurance to most U.S. workers.     Just more than 19 million continuing claims were filed for all programs for the week ended Nov. 21, including two pandemic-relief programs Congress established earlier this year. That measure, which isn’t adjusted for seasonality, fell by 1.1 million from the prior week.     Those pandemic programs—one for gig workers and others not typically eligible for jobless benefits, and another for those who have exhausted eligibility for other programs—are set to expire at the end of the year. People in the pandemic programs accounted for most of those receiving benefits last month.        
The U.S. Economy        Separately, the net worth of U.S. households hit a record $123.52 trillion in the third quarter, up 3.2% from the prior quarter, as the value of stock portfolios and real-estate holdings grew over the summer, the Federal Reserve said in a report released Thursday. Household net worth consists of the difference between assets—such as bank accounts, stock investments and real estate—minus liabilities, such as mortgage balances and consumer debt.     The report showed household debt also rose 5.6% to $16.4 trillion, its fastest pace in at least two years.     U.S. consumer prices increased last month, and wages rose slightly, the Labor Department said Wednesday in a separate report. The consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for household items such as lawn mowers and services such as eye care, grew a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in November compared with October.     Price increases were broad-based, with no one component accounting for more than a quarter of the CPI’s overall rise, according to the Labor Department.     Apparel and transportation services saw some of the biggest price increases in November, rising 0.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Prices for used cars, which rose sharply earlier this year, declined 1.3%. Grocery prices fell 0.3%.                                         Employment data showed the pace of hiring slowing substantially in November.

While total job loss this year was much higher than in the 2007-09 recession, the finance sector has been less affected, and many firms are hiring, Mr. McDonald said, to keep up with demand for mortgage refinancing and home and auto loans.     Still, recent layoffs have occurred in the entertainment and leisure industry, including at restaurants, as well as at retailers and in the transportation sector, at employers including airlines and transit authorities, said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas Inc.     Many workers laid off this spring expected to return to their jobs fairly quickly. Those laid off in recent weeks are more likely to have seen their position eliminated, he said.                  “‘When someone is let go today, that means the company doesn’t see that job existing for a while.’”                — Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray and Christmas             “When someone is let go today, that means the company doesn’t see that job existing for a while,” Mr. Challenger said.              Grace Keros    last month laid off all but four staff members from American Coney Island, a downtown Detroit diner that employed more than 20 workers before the pandemic, after the state of Michigan imposed new restrictions on in-person dining. Ms. Keros, the owner, is now limited to carryout orders and closes the former 24-hour joint as early as 4 p.m.     “In March, I had to call the locksmith to help me lock up because I couldn’t find the key,” she said.     When spring restrictions were lifted, Ms. Keros said she was able to bring back about half her staff, but sales were down with fewer office workers in the area and no crowds from baseball games or events. Now with winter approaching and unable to serve diners inside, she said she is worried about her future and that of her employees, especially because they won’t receive an extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits. Those enhanced benefits ended in July and other federal programs are set to expire this month.     “If we’re going to be told we can’t operate, the government needs to get its act together and help these workers,” she said.
