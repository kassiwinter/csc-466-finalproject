DES MOINES, Iowa—At 62 years old, Jeb Bush is still willing to test his fastball. While gripping a baseball at the Iowa State Fair, the former Florida governor announced a goal of 50 mph. As he whizzed the ball through a canyon of inflated prizes, the radar gun spoke the truth: 44 mph. He tried again: 47.Whether Mr. Bush can bring the heat to his Republican presidential campaign is a nagging question that now hangs over his candidacy. In Iowa, recent polls show him lagging behind in the low single-digits; a CNN survey showed him at 4% support, good for seventh place.

John Kasich, is encroaching on his space; the Real Clear Politics average of polls in the Granite State has Mr. Bush in second place after      Donald Trump        with 11%, and Mr. Kasich at 10%. A month ago, Mr. Bush led in New Hampshire with 16% support, and Mr. Kasich wasn’t yet in the race.     “It doesn’t look good right now,” said Dennis Albaugh, a billionaire herbicide magnate regarded as Iowa’s wealthiest man and a Bush campaign donor who hosted a campaign event Thursday night in nearby Ankeny. “I think that he’s got to get on track. I think that you’ll see him get real aggressive later on.”               During the four hours Mr. Bush spent Friday at the state fair here, he ate the requisite pork chop-on-a-stick and a deep-fried Snickers bar (cheating on his paleo diet, he said) and posed for countless selfies. He described his progress as incremental and said he is not concerned about his standing in the latest polls.     “Look, polls are irrelevant,” Mr. Bush said. “A majority of Iowans haven’t even considered who they are going to support. So you have to identify people, make them ambassadors to your campaign, be organized and work hard. And over the long haul, make slow steady progress.”     Decades of Politicking by GOP and Democratic Hopefuls at Iowa State FairA long line of candidates have rubbed shoulders and eaten with voters at the state fair grounds in Des Moines, IowaRepublican presidential candidate John McCain, left, accompanied by his wife Cindy, waves to the crowd while holding a pork chop on a stick on Aug. 8, 2008, at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines.Mary Altaffer/Associated Press1 of 12•••••     David Kochel, an Iowa native serving as Mr. Bush’s early-state strategist, stressed that the campaign is building its organization and won’t be focused on its standing in polls here until after the winter holiday season.     Indeed, Mr. Bush’s operation, leveraging his financial advantage over the rest of the GOP field, showcased its organization here. He took his questions from the press before a phalanx of cameras alongside the state’s two GOP senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. Both Iowans said the joint appearance didn’t amount to an endorsement, but couldn’t say when they would appear together with other GOP presidential contenders.     The Bush campaign’s money buys other perks. Other candidates traverse Iowa in SUVs or buses—except the front-runner Mr. Trump, who plans to arrive Saturday by helicopter. Mr. Bush flew a chartered plane between events Thursday in Davenport and suburban Des Moines.     Although he made it through four hours of greeting people at the state fair without any significant gaffe—no small feat at the setting where 2012 GOP nominee         Mitt Romney    uttered his infamous “corporations are people, too, my friend” remark—there are concerns about Mr. Bush’s performance on bigger stages. Chris McLinden, Mr. Bush’s campaign chairman for Dallas County, Iowa, said he appeared lackluster during the first GOP debate last week in Cleveland.     “Jeb needs to step it up a notch, especially after that debate,” Mr. McLinden said at the fair here. “I think you’ll see a better performance at the next debate.”     While clearly enjoying the interaction with people at the fair, Mr. Bush showed exasperation at the repeated questions about his family legacy, particularly in regard to the Iraq war. Asked by reporters how he can declare himself an “outsider” candidate given his father and brother were president, Mr. Bush exhaled deeply and replied, “Hey, I got that, I got the family thing.”                                                 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush casts a vote for himself in a corn poll sponsored by a local television station during a visit to the Iowa State Fair on Friday in Des Moines.

Bush’s administration. “This parlor game that’s played where you have 25, 30 or 40 people who are helping you with foreign policy—if they have any executive experience, they’ve had to deal with two Republican administrations. Who were the people who were the last two Republican presidents? I mean, this is kind of a tough game for me to be playing, to be honest with you.”     His pedigree, while maybe a tiresome subject for the candidate, isn’t a negative with all voters. Sandy Hoenig, a retired school counselor from Winterset, Iowa, said the Bush family history in Republican politics is precisely what attracts her to him.     Ms. Hoenig approached Mr. Bush on the fair’s main concourse Friday and pronounced her love for his family. “If you are half the man your brother George is, you’ll be fantastic,” she said.     Although Mr. Bush declared himself “all in” for Iowa, political reality is that he needs only a respectable showing, not a victory, here. Zach Nunn, a state representative from suburban Des Moines who endorsed him in June, said it is more important that Mr. Bush keep such rivals as Sen.         Marco Rubio    of Florida from gaining momentum in Iowa than posting a strong finish himself.     “You want to be able to blunt a potential front-runner,” Mr. Nunn said. “What Iowa does is weed out the giant field of people going forward to the other states,” Mr. Nunn said.     After finishing his pitches—both strikes—Mr. Bush turned back to the waiting press with a big smile on his face. Here he was, the self-declared “joyful tortoise” on the campaign trail, having fun. But at the same time, he felt his age.     “My shoulder,” he said after completing his pitches, “it’s about to fall off.”     Write to Reid J.
