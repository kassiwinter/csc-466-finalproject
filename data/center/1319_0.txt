WASHINGTON—President Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the November election and predicted the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court, a reason he wants to quickly fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice         Ruth Bader Ginsburg.    “I think this will end up in the Supreme Court. And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday. During an event on social-media companies Wednesday, Mr. Trump amplified his long-running claim of widespread ballot fraud—which studies show is rare—and asserted without providing evidence the idea that Democrats plan to use mail-in voting to tilt the election in their favor.        
The High Court and the 2020 Election        Later, during a news conference, Mr. Trump was asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer whether he won or lost in November.               “Well, we’re going to have to see what happens,” he responded. “I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots.…The ballots are out of control.”     Pressed on the question, the president said, “Get rid of the ballots and…we’ll have a very peaceful. There won’t be a transfer. Frankly, there’ll be a continuation.”     Lawmakers from both parties called Mr. Trump’s comments unacceptable.     “President Trump: You are not a dictator, and America will not permit you to be one,” tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).     “Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power,” tweeted         Sen. Mitt Romney    (R., Utah). “Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable.”     Democratic nominee      Joe Biden,        who is leading Mr. Trump in national and swing-state polls responded to Mr. Trump’s comments Wednesday night: “What country are we in? I’m being facetious,” he told reporters. “I said, What country are we in? Look, he says the most irrational things. I don’t know what to say.”     Five states—Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah—routinely conduct elections primarily by mail. In response to the pandemic, at least four additional states—California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont—and the District of Columbia have pledged to mail out ballots to all properly registered voters for the November election.     Many other states allow voters to request a mail-in ballot without providing a specific reason, such as being away on Election Day. Some states restrict who can vote absentee.     Mr. Trump, who in 2016 frequently predicted a “rigged” election, contends the measures, many put in place because of the pandemic, would lead to fraud and prompt legal challenges that end up before the Supreme Court.        
More on Mail-In Ballots        Demand Justice, a liberal group that focuses on the courts, decried the remarks.     “Even though Republicans may claim to already have the votes to confirm Trump’s pick, Democrats cannot afford to compartmentalize this Supreme Court fight because the fate of the election itself may ride on it,” the group’s executive director, Brian Fallon, said in a statement.     Mr. Trump is set to name his court nominee Saturday, setting off what is expected to be an intensely partisan fight, even though Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm a successor to Justice Ginsburg, who died Friday.     His comments about voting by mail or absentee ballot—which is how the president casts his vote in Florida—have generated confusion and led to some concern among Republicans that it could hurt turnout. Mr. Trump in tweets lately has sought to draw a distinction between ballots people request and those that states are sending out automatically to properly registered voters.     State and local governments have various measures to protect mail-in ballots, though specifics vary. Election officials regularly have chain-of-custody processes to track how many ballots were mailed to voters. Other examples of safeguards include bar codes to track ballots through the mail, or requiring voters to provide personal information such as a signature.     Academic studies and election scholars say there is no evidence of widespread fraud linked to mailed ballots, though there have been isolated cases.     Research isn’t definitive on whether voting by mail benefits one party more than another. Past elections held primarily through mail-in voting have shown mixed party outcomes.     Procedures for verifying and counting ballots help insure against fraud. When election officials receive ballots, “they start a chain of custody,” said Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona elections officer who is now a senior adviser with the Democracy Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based foundation that works on democracy issues. “Every step of the way, we have the ability to know how many ballots are in any given place.”     In December 2000, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision decided the presidential race in favor of         George W. Bush    after it stopped a recount that was under way in Florida, where only 537 votes separated Mr. Bush and Democrat         Al Gore.    Florida’s 25 electoral votes put Mr. Bush over the top.          Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com and Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
