                 | July 27, 2020 09:15 AM                 | Updated Jul 27, 2020, 10:07 AM                National security adviser Robert O'Brien has tested positive for the coronavirus.      O’Brien "tested positive for COVID-19. He has mild symptoms and has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site. There is no risk of exposure to the President or the Vice President. The work of the National Security Council continues uninterrupted,” the White House said in a statement on Monday.            The White House official contracted the virus while attending a family event, sources told Bloomberg News.      O'Brien recently returned from Europe, where he and his top deputy met with officials from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, according to CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins.      People around President Trump are consistently tested for COVID-19.      Vice President Mike Pence's top spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus in May and has since returned to work.      O'Brien is the most senior level White House official to date to contract the coronavirus.
