However, it was unclear if all of the nation's Internet connections were back up. The blackout came less than a week after the FBI accused the country of being behind the hack that forced Sony Pictures to cancel the release of 'The Interview.' The Internet blackout began sometime Monday morning Eastern Time, a U.S. official confirmed to NBC News. Two U.S. officials denied any U.S. involvement in the outage. It was not immediately clear what had caused the outage, which came after President Barack Obama promised that the United States would "respond proportionally" to what he said on Sunday was an "act of cybervandalism."The hack of Sony Pictures by a group calling itself the "Guardians of Peace," or GOP, forced the studio to cancel the planned Christmas release of the action-comedy, which centers around a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. While North Korea's elite might be affected by the outage, most of the country's citizens don't have access to the Internet. DYN Research conducts Internet performance tests around the world.
