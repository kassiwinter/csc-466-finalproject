Cohen — who pleaded guilty earlier on Tuesday to helping President Trump pay hush money to two women — wants to tell Mueller that Trump knew of an infamous 2016 meeting at Trump Tower and the Russian hacking of Democratic institutions before they took place, Lanny Davis told MSNBC.
“Mr. Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest to the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows,” Davis told the network.
“Not just about the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election, which the Trump Tower meeting was all about, but also knowledge about the computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr. Trump knew ahead of time about that crime and even cheered it on.”
Last month a source told The Post that Cohen was present when Trump was informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. that Russians offered “dirt” on then-candidate Hillary Clinton.
Trump claimed he “didn’t know anything about the meeting” because “nobody told me” about it.
During the June 2016 meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
The four Russians in the room included a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist.
The Trump Tower meeting is being considered as evidence of the Trump campaign working along with Russians to defeat Clinton.
