Those countries, which include Poland and Sweden, are part of Europe’s visa-free Schengen area.Spencer said at the time that he would try to challenge the ban, which is in place for five years, according to the AP.“I’m being treated like a criminal by the Polish government. It’s just insane,” Spencer said at the time. “I haven’t done anything. What are they accusing me of?”Spencer, a leader within the “alt-right," is one of the more well-known white nationalists in the U.S.His website was reportedly taken down by the hosting service GoDaddy last month, and Facebook also removed two Spencer-affiliated pages earlier this year.
