                 | March 22, 2021 08:35 AM                New data from AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trial, which has yet to receive emergency authorization in the United States, is showing positive results.       The latest data from the company published on Monday showed that the vaccine has an efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic cases of the coronavirus while being 100% effective at stopping severe disease and hospitalization. The trial included 32,449 participants, and a fifth of them, approximately 8,000 people, were 65 years old or older. 60% of study participants have comorbidities that make them more at risk for a more severe bout with the virus.

Of the participants, less than half of 1%, 0.43% or 141 people, experienced a symptomatic case of the coronavirus.       Unlike other COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved already, the two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were administered four weeks apart, and “previous trials have shown that an extended interval of up to 12 weeks demonstrated greater efficacy, which was also supported by immunogenicity data.”       The Data Safety Monitoring Board found no safety concerns for “thrombotic events.”       “These results add to the growing body of evidence that shows this vaccine is well tolerated and highly effective against all severities of COVID-19 and across all age groups," Mene Pangalos, executive vice president, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said. "We are confident this vaccine can play an important role in protecting millions of people worldwide against this lethal virus. We are preparing to submit these findings to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and for the rollout of millions of doses across America should the vaccine be granted U.S. Emergency Use Authorization.”       The trial took place in the U.S., Peru, and Chile.

There have been about 30 cases of blood clots among 5 million people who received their vaccine. Denmark was the first nation to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine. Since then, several other countries have followed, including the Netherlands, Norway, Iceland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Congo, Bulgaria, and Thailand.       The European Medicines Agency said there is “no indication” that the vaccine causes blood clots.
