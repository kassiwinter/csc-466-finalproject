                                                  President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe committed to increasing pressure on North Korea, and to urging the international community to do the same, according to the White House.

The president’s statement came about 14 hours after the North Korean launch, which was considered one of the most provocative missile tests in years because it flew over Japanese territory, passing the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.                                               Emergency sirens blared in Japan on Tuesday as a North Korean missile flew over the northern island of Hokkaido before plunging into the Pacific ocean. Despite measures taken by the government, some residents say they feel unprepared for missile attacks.

Messers. Trump and Abe committed to increasing pressure on North Korea, and to urging the international community to do the same, according to the White House.     Mr. Trump’s statement omitted the administration’s earlier praise for apparent North Korean “restraint,” with Tuesday’s launch coming three days after a series of shorter range missile launches.     “Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world,” Mr. Trump said. “All options are on the table.”     The United Nations Security Council will hold a closed emergency consultation session on Tuesday afternoon to discuss North Korea’s latest firing of a missile over Japan. The U.S. together with South Korea and Japan asked for the meeting, but Security Council diplomats said its unlikely that any action or statement would be issued today.     U.S. Ambassador         Nikki Haley    told reporters that North Korea’s action was “unacceptable” and that the country “had violated every single U.N. Security Council resolution.”     “We are going to talk about what else is left to do. Something serious has to happen,” said Ms. Haley.     In early August, the U.S. successfully pushed the Council to adopt tougher economic sanctions on North Korea with China and Russia’s endorsement. But diplomats say that sanctions are a long-term strategy that takes a while to have impact. Shorter strategies range from military action to cutting diplomatic.     —Farnaz Fassihi contributed to this article.     Write to Michael C.
