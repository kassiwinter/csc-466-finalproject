Mr Macron and Mrs May - in one of her final engagements as Conservative leader - were in Ver-sur-Mer to see the first stone laid for a memorial to commemorate the 22,442 British troops who died there in the summer of 1944.The memorial, which overlooks Gold Beach, depicts three soldiers advancing across the sand.Media caption, Mrs May and Mr Macron say 'thank you' to D-Day veteransMrs May said she was humbled to be able to mark the moment with veterans, who belonged to a "very special generation"."A generation whose unconquerable spirit shaped the post-war world. They didn't boast. They didn't fuss. They served," she said.Media caption, "I don't think I should tell you what I saw because it was so horrible""And they laid down their lives so that we might have a better life and build a better world."If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was 6 June, 1944," she added.Image source, PAImage caption, D-Day veterans made the journey to Normandy to attend commemorationsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, D-Day Royal Navy veteran Ted Emmings, 94, passes a house in Arromanches decorated with a photo of himself and other veteransAlso paying tribute, Mr Macron said: "This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines."The French president also went on to say he was proud to have worked with Mrs May."Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain.
