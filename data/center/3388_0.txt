TIJUANA, Mexico—When a group of nearly 200 migrants from Central America reached the U.S. border crossing here Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the crossing was full and couldn’t process asylum seekers.The migrants are part of a caravan that has drawn the attention, and ire, of President      Donald Trump.        The president has said the group’s plan to ask for asylum is evidence that there is a crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico. The first 50 people who went through the gates and into the port were told they would have to wait until there is more capacity, said Alex Mensing, a caravan organizer.

The others were corralled just outside the gates into the U.S. Customs building. Volunteer lawyers and immigrant-rights activists sat with them, waiting.               The remaining migrants—more than 100 people—planned to spend the night in the plaza on the Mexican side of the border, Mr. Mensing said.     “We will stay here until every single asylum seeker is taken,” he said.     U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement Sunday evening, “At this time, we have reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry.”      “Depending upon port circumstances at the time of arrival, those individuals may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities,” the agency said.     On Saturday, San Diego Chief Patrol Agent         Rodney Scott    said several groups of people associated with the caravan had illegally crossed the border by climbing over a scrap-metal fence on either side of the port of entry. Those people were arrested and separated from the caravan group.     On Sunday, the remaining migrants left downtown Tijuana around 3:30 p.m. PDT to make the final walk to the border. Some of the migrants were crying.     Chanting “we are migrants, we are not criminals,” the caravan made its way to the Mexican side of the port and were greeted by Mexican immigration officials who told them they would have to separate into smaller groups before heading into the port to seek asylum on the American side.      Rudolfo Figueroa, a Mexican immigration official, said only U.S. officials could decide if the migrants would be allowed to make asylum requests Sunday night. He asked organizers to divide the migrants into smaller groups so they wouldn’t overwhelm the port.     When the group arrived at Friendship Park on the border with the U.S. on Sunday, they were greeted by supporters standing on the beach on the other side of a 20-foot fence that marks the border where it meets the Pacific Ocean.     Their march to the border brings to the end a nearly monthlong trip from Central America and across Mexico.     The migrants arrived in buses last week and took up residence in shelters around Tijuana, not far from the border. At the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter, more than 130 Central Americans stayed in tents inside the tin-roofed building within view of the border. Ana Suaso, a Honduran woman who was traveling with three of her children, said Thursday she was ready to make the final push to the U.S.     “I’m ready to go,” she said, standing outside the shelter.                                                 Migrants from Central America walk next to the border fence on Sunday.

The government is prohibited from jailing children, and the Department of Homeland Security doesn’t have a blanket policy about separating asylum seekers from their children, though officials have said a standard policy to separate families is being considered. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the government to stop the practice of separating some parents and children who are seeking asylum at the border.     Mr. Trump has urged Mexico to stop the caravan and has deployed the National Guard to the border to help the U.S. Customs and Border Protection secure the area. He has repeatedly tweeted about the group, at times praising Mexican authorities after the group seemed to slow and later pledging to stop them from crossing the border.     In a fundraising email sent to supporters recently, Mr. Trump said he has directed the Department of Homeland Security to “STOP the caravan of illegal immigrants trying to cross our WIDE-OPEN BORDER” and calling again for an “impenetrable WALL.”     Write to Alicia A.
