Edit StoryEditors' Pick|Jun 16, 2020,10:40am EDT|TOPLINE The Minnesota Freedom Fund pulled in more than $30 million in donations following the death of George Floyd, but the non-profit bailing out jailed protesters faced backlash on Tuesday after revealing it has paid out $200,000 so far, as calls grew for transparency about how the donations are being spent.

KEY FACTS   The non-profit, which pays criminal bail and immigration bonds, initially posted a couple of tweets on Tuesday addressing how the donations had been spent so far.  “Without jeopardizing the safety of the folks we bailed out we paid well over $200k in the weeks since the uprising alone. We are working on doing more,” the organization wrote.   The fund was established in 2016 and has seen a huge profile boost following the death of Floyd on May 25 in police custody, which sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.   Celebrities, campaigners and influencers were among figures to post links to donate to the fund in recent weeks. The fund became overwhelmed with donations to the point they stopped soliciting them and encouraged people to donate to other causes.  But critics questioned why more hadn’t been spent and suggested some of the funds could be redirected to other causes or small businesses in the community. Others defended the organization for trying to establish the infrastructure to deploy the millions of dollars.   The MFF later addressed critics in follow-up tweets, saying all protest-related bail sent their way had been paid.  The fund’s FAQs state that up until recent events, they would pay out a maximum of $1,000 in a given day.                 Tangent Critics also called out an apparent lack of diversity on the fund’s leadership, while its “Meet Our Team” page appears to have been taken down as of Tuesday afternoon. Key background Anti-racism charities and organizations received an unprecedented outpouring of financial support in the wake of Floyd’s death and corporations, celebrities and individuals moved to support their work. But questions are increasingly being raised about where the millions of dollars in donations are going, as well as who is behind some of the most publicized funds. BuzzFeed revealed this week that more than $4 million dollars were raised for the Black Lives Matter Foundation, a group that has no links to the Black Lives Matter movement.
