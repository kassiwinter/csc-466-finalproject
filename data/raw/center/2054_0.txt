An Islamic State operative suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks had been monitored in Syria by Western allies seeking to kill him in an airstrike, but they couldn’t locate him in the weeks before the plot was carried out, two Western security officials said.The operative, a Belgian citizen named Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was convicted in absentia in Brussels earlier this year of recruiting jihadists, was suspected of masterminding a foiled plot to behead police officers, escaped to Syria and was profiled in Islamic State’s online magazine mocking European authorities for their failure to catch him. A year ago, video emerged of him in Syria, smiling as he drove a truck dragging the dead bodies of Islamic State’s opponents tied to the bumper. Mr. Abaaoud is one of two people who have emerged at the center of a probe into the attacks that killed 129 people on Friday. Both are at large. French and Belgian authorities are also searching for a 26-year-old petty criminal named Salah Abdeslam, who they say rented a car used in the attacks on Friday and is suspected of driving some of the suicide bombers through Paris.      On Monday, dozens of masked Belgian police stormed a house in a predominantly Muslim district in Brussels in their hunt for Mr. Abdeslam.                                         French authorities have named some of the perpetrators of the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris. Officials believe the assailants carried out the atrocities on behalf of Islamic State. Here's what we know so far.                                                                                                     French prosecutors said police had stopped Mr. Abdeslam and two other men on their way to Brussels just hours after the Friday massacre. But a roadside background check failed to show that Mr. Abdeslam had rented a car in Belgium that was found outside the Bataclan night club, the site of one of the attacks, and police let him go.               The two men long resided a few blocks from each other in Brussels’ Molenbeek district, where police conducted the raid Monday, and spent time in the same prison, according to a Belgian official. “It is certain that they knew each other,” the official said.          Mr. Abaaoud—who escaped to Syria in January after Belgian police foiled another terrorist plot authorities say he masterminded—had been under surveillance there as part of an effort to track down and kill Islamic State militants believed to be directly involved in recruiting Westerners for the militant group, according to the officials.      Officials had no knowledge of the Paris plot when they sought to have Mr. Abaaoud killed by airstrike, and don’t know whether the killing of Mr. Abaaoud would have prevented the attacks in the French capital. The plotters may have been able to act independently or, in Mr. Abaaoud’s absence, another Islamic State militant could have stepped in, they said.        
The Attacks in Paris        Growing evidence that Islamic State operatives were able to plot the attacks from abroad—mobilizing a group of seven suicide bombers to carry them out, including one of Mr. Abdeslam’s brothers—suggests the extremist group has gained an unprecedented level of ability to coordinate a large-scale operation and hit Europe.     The emerging details about the plotters and their ability to elude authorities also have exposed the lack of cross-border coordination among European security officials.     Islamic State’s use of Belgium as a staging ground for the assault on Paris helped the militants to go undetected as they prepared their attack, European officials said.     As French and Belgian investigators sought to comprehend how Islamic State could have built a large terror cell in the heart of Europe, featuring the two men and others involved in the attacks, authorities scrambled to tighten the net on extremists.     French President         François Hollande    proposed extending France’s state of national emergency in the wake of the attacks for three months and called for international cooperation from Russia and the U.S. as he vowed to step up airstrikes against terrorist bastions.

People familiar with the probe said investigators were anxious to identify and neutralize whoever made the explosive vests the attackers used to blow up themselves at France’s largest sports arena, a concert hall and a restaurant.     In Belgium, a judge ordered two people, who were detained in Brussels, to remain held for allegedly providing support to the Paris attackers. Another brother of Mr. Abdeslam was also detained by police for questioning over the weekend but later let go.

The Belgian government investigated him when he returned and concluded he didn’t pose a risk.     Despite his effort to go to Syria, authorities didn’t view him as a terror threat, the official said. “The investigation showed no signs of him actively going to terrorism,” he said.     Police viewed Mr. Abaaoud as a much more dangerous man.                                          French police named a 29-year-old French national as one of the attackers who killed at least 129 people in Paris on Friday. Police are also investigating a car with firearms inside that was found on the edge of the city.

In July, Mr. Abaaoud, who is known in Belgium for having taken his 13-year-old brother with him to Syria in 2014, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in absentia by a Brussels court earlier this year on terrorism charges and for recruiting jihadists. Belgian courts don’t appoint lawyers when defendants are tried in absentia.     Raised in Belgium, he returned to Europe from Syria at some point under the radar of authorities with the aim of beheading Belgian police officers, officials say. Police foiled the plot in January, and in a shootout, killed two other suspected accomplices in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers. Officials believe Mr. Abaaoud escaped to Syria that same month.     In a purported interview with Mr. Abaaoud in February, Islamic State’s online magazine quoted the Belgian national of Moroccan descent mocking European law enforcement authorities.          “My name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland, plan operations against them, and leave safely when doing so became necessary,” he was quoted as saying.     According to a Western intelligence official, intelligence services have monitored Mr. Abaaoud’s communications from Syria to associates in Europe, but weren’t always sure whether it was the Islamic State operative or his teenage brother on the line. That complicated any plans to kill him with an airstrike, the official said.     After the planned attacks on Belgian police were thwarted, a core group of French-speaking Belgians in Syria started to plan and recruit for attacks on public places—including on a concert hall—in France, Spain, the Netherlands and the U.K., the official said.     The information comes from interrogations of French members of Islamic State who were arrested by Turkish police after leaving Syria and were extradited to France, the official said. The French militants said Mr. Abaaoud was leading plans to carry out attacks, the official said.      A surge in the number of such radicals traveling between France and Syria and other conflict zones has also hindered France’s surveillance effort. The number of people on France’s security watch list has reached 8,000, compared with about 5,000 three years ago. Officials say it is impossible to track even a fraction of these people full-time.                                          Belgian and French officials are investigating whether Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamic State member, was involved in Friday’s attacks in Paris. Meanwhile, French police on Monday conducted more than 150 raids, searching the homes of suspected radical Islamists.

One radical on the watch list was         Omar Ismail Mostefai,    a Frenchman who authorities say was part of a trio that attacked the Bataclan concert hall on Friday, killing 89 people, before detonating their suicide vests. The militant had been on a watch list for radicalization since 2010. Mr. Mostefai is believed to have later traveled to Syria, raising suspicions he fought alongside Islamic State. French officials declined to say whether Mr. Mostefai was monitored when he returned home in the spring of 2014.     On Monday, a senior Turkish official said Ankara had identified Mr. Mostefai as a terrorism suspect and twice notified French authorities to no avail.     “The case of Omar Ismail Mostefai clearly establishes that intelligence sharing and effective communication are crucial to counterterrorism efforts,” the Turkish official said.     Mr. Mostefai traveled to Turkey in 2013 and was flagged to French authorities as recently as June, the Turkish official said. There is no record of the 29-year-old French national leaving Turkey.     French Foreign Minister         Laurent Fabius    said he was unaware of Turkey’s warnings about Mr. Mostefai. “As far as information and intelligence are concerned, we really should exchange and share much more,” Mr. Fabius said at a news conference on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Antalya on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast.              Samy Amimour,    another Frenchman who investigators say took part in the Bataclan attack, had been facing an international arrest warrant for failing to check in with police on a regular basis. Mr. Amimour was required to report to police after prosecutors placed him under investigation in 2012 for attempting to travel to Yemen, a country rife with jihadist activity. He later traveled to Syria.                                         The recent terror attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people are just the latest of many attacks by Islamic State around the world.

German authorities said they had notified the French of the arrest at the time.      Militants have long hopscotched across the Continent’s national borders without facing internal border checks. But Friday’s attacks showed that even Europe’s external borders are dangerously porous, particularly as the region copes with the influx of refugees from Syria and elsewhere.     A fake Syrian passport was enough to secure one suicide bomber’s passage into Europe via Greece, officials say, allowing him to reach the Stade de France on Friday night and detonate an explosive vest lined with bolts.     —Adam Entous, Noemie Bisserbe and Emre Peker contributed to this article.
