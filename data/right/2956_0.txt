President Trump said Tuesday morning that “all options are on the table” after North Korea launched a missile that flew over Japan.“The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior,” Trump said in an early morning statement, hours after North Korea tested the missile. “Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.” Trump and Japanese President Shinzo Abe spoke shortly after the missile test, the fourth that North Korea has conducted in as many days. The latest salvo is North Korea’s first launch over Japanese terrority. Abe called the test an “unprecedented serious and grave threat to Japan” that “significantly undermines the peace and security of the region,” CNN reported. Follow Chuck on Twitter
