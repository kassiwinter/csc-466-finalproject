                                                                                                                                         President-elect Donald Trump is set to meet with The New York Times on Tuesday after all, after earlier saying he was calling off the meeting.                                                                                                                                                      “The meeting is taking place as planned,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a text message, according to a pool report.                                                                                                                                                      Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the paper, confirmed that Mr. Trump’s staff told them the meeting was on again.                                                                                                                                                                    “He will meet with our publisher off-the-record and that session will be followed by an on-the-record meeting with our journalists and editorial columnists,” Ms. Murphy said, according to another pool report.                                                                                                                              Mr. Trump had said on Twitter earlier Tuesday that he canceled the meeting when the terms and conditions were changed.                                                                                                                                                                 “I cancelled today’s meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice,” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The paper disputed this, saying it had always been pushing for an on-the-record session but that Mr. Trump’s team wanted it to be a private meeting.                                                                                                                   Mr. Trump held an off-the-record meeting with television news executives and anchors in New York on Monday.
