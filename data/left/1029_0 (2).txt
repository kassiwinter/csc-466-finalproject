"As far as the Affordable Care Act as I call it, the fact is that, yes, what has happened is unacceptable in terms of the glitches," the California Democrat said in an interview aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week." "They were overwhelmed to begin with. There is much that needs to be done to correct the situation."
While Pelosi said fixes were needed, she said the high traffic to the exchange websites in early days proved the law would eventually be successful.
"This has to be fixed but what doesn't have to be fixed is the fact that tens of millions more people will have access to affordable quality health care," she said.
