Investors Daniel Abraham and Donald Sussman each gave $3 million to Priorities USA Action. The super PAC's total haul was $9.9 million, down from $11.9 million in June. The group finished July with $38.7 million cash on hand. The super PAC has been spending aggressively on a torrent of ads attacking Republican nominee Donald Trump, including about a half-million on ads over the next two weeks. The latest gift makes Sussman, the founder of Paloma Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut, the group's biggest benefactor this cycle, with $11 million to date, overtaking Univision Chairman Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl. Abraham, who founded the company behind Slim-Fast, has given $6 million.
The next-biggest donors in July were the Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA) PAC, at $1 million, and Ann Doerr, wife of venture capitalist John Doerr, and medical technology heiress Pat Stryker, each with $500,000. Other repeat donors include Jay Robert and Mary Kathryn Pritzker, with $450,000 each, and billionaire investor George Soros, with $35,308.50.
Priorities USA transferred $1.9 million to the Women Vote super PAC, $655,000 to VoteVets, and $500,000 to the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee, which organized the Democratic National Convention.
