        The US Census Bureau is not expected to meet a year-end deadline for turning in figures used to apportion congressional seats, according to a report Wednesday. A bureau source told The Associated Press that the agency is set to announce that the Dec. 31 deadline will be blown for the first time since it was established by Congress more than four decades ago. Bureau documents obtained earlier this month by a House of Representatives committee indicate that officials don’t expect the count to be finished until after President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The Democrat could use the delay to rescind a memorandum issued by President Trump ordering the Census Bureau to not include illegal immigrants in their apportionment tally, a move that could shift the balance of power away from areas with substantial undocumented populations. The Supreme Court earlier this month swatted down a challenge to Trump’s memorandum, but said it was too soon to rule on the legality of the plan itself. New York, which leads the nation in population decline, is set to lose a House seat, early returns show.
