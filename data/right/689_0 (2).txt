"It is an attempt to trigger a migration crisis."       The Polish government will also offer humanitarian assistance to migrants stuck at the border for over two weeks.              Poland is one of four European Union nations accusing Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of sending the migrants, who are mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, across the EU's external border in a sort of "hybrid war."       "Using immigrants to destabilize neighboring countries constitutes a clear breach of the international law and qualifies as a hybrid attack against ... Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and thus against the entire European Union," the nations said in a joint statement Monday, urging the United Nations to look into the situation.       Estonia is among the countries flooded with immigrants.       The nation's deputy foreign minister, Pawel Jablonski, said the border situation tests how Poland will react to more severe acts of hybrid warfare.
