After some criticized a Republican National Committee Christmas message that appeared to compare Donald Trump to Jesus and call him "a new King," the group's spokesman struck back, saying the message had nothing to do with the president-elect.Part of the RNC holiday message, which was released on Christmas by co-chairs Reince Priebus and Sharon Day, reads as follows: "Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind. Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King."Some reacted forcefully to the message on social media.The @GOP is comparing Trump to Jesus and calls him our "new King" because delusion and terror don't take a break for Christmas— Like, a smart person (@RyanRosenblatt) December 25, 2016GOP Christmas message heralds a new "King". Trump our new king? R u as scared as I am of the next 4 years with our king #notmypresident— thanx_a_latte (@thanx_a_latte) December 25, 2016However, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer, who last week was tapped by Trump to serve as press secretary, both tweeted and told CNN that the message had nothing to do with the incoming president."Christ is the King. He was born today so we could be saved," Spicer tweeted. "Its sad & disappointing you are politicizing such a holy day."Spicer's message was sent in response to BuzzFeed reporter David Mack's tweet, which stated that when the reporter had asked Spicer whether there was an intentional comparison between Jesus Christ and Trump, Spicer replied, "I hope you are kidding." A screenshot showed a purported message from Spicer to Mack stating, "To ask this on Christmas is frankly offensive."Spicer also attacked both CNN and BuzzFeed on Twitter, demanding that BuzzFeed apologize and criticizing CNN for mocking the RNC for "acknowledging that Christ is the King of Christians."Boston Globe video
