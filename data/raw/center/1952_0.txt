Hillary Clinton on Tuesday again dismissed criticism of her use of a private email server as politically minded attacks, as a federal judge prepares for a hearing amid a host of lawsuits over her communications while she was secretary of state.On Thursday, government lawyers will spar with Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, over whether U.S. officials are making a good-faith effort to find government correspondence involving Mrs. Clinton and her senior staff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also probing the matter, after the inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies determined that a review of 40 emails on the server found four that contained classified information.

Earlier this week, government lawyers filed court papers indicating that a continuing review of Mrs. Clinton’s emails had found more than 300 documents that may contain classified information.     Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, has been under fire for months after revelations she exclusively used a private email account during her time at the State Department. Department rules discouraged though didn’t prohibit that setup, but use of such a server could make her emails more vulnerable to hackers and may have made it harder for citizens to request documents under the Freedom of Information Act.                Simply using a government email account wouldn’t be enough to protect classified information. Many government officials use a so-called low-side system for nonclassified discussions, and a high-side system for discussions of sensitive materials. But the definitions can get murky for people who deal with both classified and nonclassified information.     Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration, said the fight over Mrs. Clinton’s email is a high-profile, high-stakes version of a battle that has been waged for years between U.S. intelligence officials and those at other agencies.     “People in the intelligence community live in this hermetically sealed environment in which everything is classified and nothing ever crosses out of their world into the public,” said Mr. Miller. “People in other agencies have to work in both the classified environment and the real world, and sometimes they get information from both and synthesize information from both.”          The FBI is trying to determine whether there were security weaknesses in Mrs. Clinton’s server. That probe is examining who had access to her email system, how it operated and what type of information was kept there, according to people familiar with the matter.     The FBI has taken possession of thumb drives from Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer and a server from a computer company she used, these people said. The Justice Department has said the FBI probe isn’t a criminal investigation, but some prominent Republicans have urged them to make it one.     The FBI investigation has spawned other inquiries. This week, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) sought answers to how Mrs. Clinton’s private lawyer got a security clearance, how he secured the thumb drives that contained Clinton emails and whether anyone else in the lawyer’s office had access to that material.     On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton told reporters in Nevada that at the center of the inquiries is a disagreement between agencies over what should have been classified but wasn’t. “That’s what they are sorting out,” she said. “But, whether it was a personal account or a government account, I did not send classified material and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified.”     Mrs. Clinton also said that if she used a government server and released everything, Republicans would still be attacking her. Asked if computer servers that held her emails had since been wiped clean, she threw up her hands and said, “Like with a cloth? I don’t know how it works digitally at all.”     Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch’s director of investigations, said the Clinton team’s move to set up her own server is “unprecedented and extraordinary.”                                                 Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton told reporters in Las Vegas that at the center of inquiries over her use of a private email server while secretary of state is a disagreement between federal agencies about what should have been classified but wasn’t.

Last month, judge in this case, Emmet Sullivan, half-jokingly asked, “Is there a judge in this court who does not have one of these cases?”     Thomas Blanton, director of George Washington University’s National Security Archive, which uses Freedom of Information Act requests and reporting to uncover government secrets, said the debate over Mrs. Clinton’s emails has obscured an important fact about how the U.S. government works. Without Mrs. Clinton’s private server, many of her emails as secretary of state wouldn’t have been recovered at all because there was no obligation to preserve them electronically.     What Mrs. Clinton did “was still wrong in the sense she was the head of the agency and she’s supposed to enforce the records law,” Mr. Blanton argued, “but people have to realize that if she had used the state.gov system, likely very few of those emails would have survived today because state.gov does not e-archive its emails.”     Mr. Blanton noted that his office recently received transcripts of phone conversations of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in which Mr. Blanton said U.S. intelligence officials redacted “big chunks” of the conversations—even though the State Department had officially released those conversations in 2007.
