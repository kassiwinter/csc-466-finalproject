More than 1 million Americans will lose benefits Saturday because  Congress didn’t extend them. Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and  Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island have proposed extending the  benefits for three months.                                                                                                                              The White House says Obama called it an urgent economic priority.                                                                                                                                                                 — BEACH TIME: Before noon, the first family went to Bellows Air Force  Base in Waimanalo to spend some time at the beach. Waimanalo is a town  just south of Kailua along Oahu’s eastern shore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            __ DINNER: The first family dined in Waikiki at Nobu, a Japanese  restaurant known for its modern cuisine. As the president’s motorcade  left Kailua, about 25 protesters lined the street near the family  vacation home in protest of a multilateral trade pact being negotiated  between the United States and several countries in Asia and elsewhere.                                                                                                                   When the Obamas arrived in Waikiki, crowds of tourists on a busy street took photos and video of their motorcade.
