WASHINGTON -- Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) on Sunday announced that after some "emotional soul-searching," she had decided to support the pending Iran nuclear deal.In what she described as "the most difficult decision I have had to make in the nearly 23 years I have served in elected office," Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote in a lengthy Miami Herald op-ed that she had "come to the conclusion that the agreement promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits my vote of support."Wasserman Schultz, who is the first Jewish woman to be elected to U.S. Congress in Florida, explained that she wrestled with the decision because "Iran's leaders routinely call for the destruction of the United States, the nation to which I have dedicated my life to serving. Iran's leaders are also virulent anti-Semites and call for the destruction of Israel, the historic homeland for me and millions of other Jews."The congresswoman listed several concerns about the accord, including arguments opponents of the deal have made about compliance, inspections and Iran's trustworthiness. Ultimately, however, she said she reached her decision based on "the conclusion that we cannot now get a better deal, as I was unable to find a credible source to say otherwise."Read the whole op-ed at The Miami Herald.
