President      Donald Trump        on Wednesday sought to refute allegations that the Russian government tried to help his presidential campaign and damage that of         Hillary Clinton,    arguing that his policies run counter to the Kremlin’s interests.“There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite” of what Russian President      Vladimir Putin        would want, Mr. Trump said in a television interview. “So what I keep hearing about that he [Mr. Putin] would have rather had Trump, I think—probably not.”           The comments to the Christian Broadcasting Network came a day after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. released documents showing he accepted a meeting to discuss an alleged Russian government offer of help damaging Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign. Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was a waste of time and nothing came of it. He and two other senior campaign aides—his brother-in-law         Jared Kushner    and         Paul Manafort,    then the campaign chairman—met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York last June.      Mr. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he didn’t know of the meeting at the time and only learned about it in recent days. The president also defended his son: “I think many people would have held that meeting,” Mr. Trump said.          On Wednesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would be inviting Mr. Manafort to a hearing he is organizing on the issue of foreign lobbying and influence in the U.S. Mr. Grassley said Mr. Manafort’s attendance at the meeting with the Russian lawyer would be a topic of conversation.          Earlier in the day, the president, on Twitter, defended his son’s actions, praising an interview he did with Fox News. “He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad.”     In his comments to CBN, the president suggested that Mr. Putin would have preferred that Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the Democratic nominee, win the 2016 election. Mr. Trump alleged her stances on military and energy policy would have been more helpful to Moscow.     “If Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive,” Mr. Trump said, citing his plans to boost energy extraction and build up the military. “That’s what Putin doesn’t like about me.”     During the U.S. presidential campaign, Mr. Putin was seen as far warmer to Mr. Trump than to Mrs. Clinton, whom he sparred with during the Barack Obama administration. Following the election, Mrs. Clinton attributed the alleged cyberhacking by Russia to Mr. Putin’s “personal beef against me.”                                         WSJ's Gerald F.

The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the race, and was trying to tilt the election to favor Mr. Trump.      The Kremlin has denied meddling in the U.S. election, while Mr. Trump routinely dismisses the matter as a witch hunt and has suggested other countries besides Russia could have been behind the interference.

I have very little time for watching T.V.”     Some White House aides have said they fear the Russia email story will make it increasingly difficult to advance the president’s policy agenda.     “The president wants to be focused on his agenda,” said spokeswoman         Sarah Huckabee Sanders    during a White House briefing. “He’d much rather be talking about health care, tax reform, infrastructure, national security. That’s his focus.”          Mr. Trump has been quietly giving his son advice on managing the latest revelations involving his campaign’s dealings with Russians. Ms. Sanders said the two men had spoken in recent days.     On Tuesday, the younger Mr. Trump released a chain of emails that showed he had been told the Russian government possessed information damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy and that an individual described as a “Russian government attorney” wanted to pass the material to the Trump campaign.     “If it’s what you say,” the younger Mr. Trump wrote to the intermediary who arranged the meetings, a British publicist, “I love it.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting proved a waste of time and that the woman had no such information to provide.     The Russian lawyer,         Natalia Veselnitskaya,    told NBC News she didn’t have incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton and had no connection to the Russian government.     In his Fox News interview on Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. said he “probably would have done things a little differently” than agreeing to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya.      —Byron Tau contributed to this article.
