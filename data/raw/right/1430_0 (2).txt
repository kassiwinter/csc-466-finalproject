                                                                                                                                         Sen. Rand Paul is not confident the GOP will win enough seats to take control of the Senate next month, saying that while Republicans will win three seats being left open by Democratic retirements, others are tougher to predict.                                                                                                                                                      “There’s at least three states that we’re going to pick up, West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana. There’s five or six states that hang in the balance beyond that,” Mr. Paul said Tuesday during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Paul said Senate races in Iowa, Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana that seem to favor Republican candidates may be too close to call.                                                                                                                                                                    “This will be one of those elections were you have to count the votes and stay up late,” Mr. Paul said.                                                                                                                              The libertarian-leaning Republican, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, said President Obama’s decline in popularity would help Republicans at the polls and blasted Mr. Obama’s foreign policy leadership.                                                                                                                                                       Mr. Paul campaigned in North Carolina last week with GOP Senate candidate Thom Tillis and said he plans to travel to Kansas later in the month to stump with Sen. Pat Roberts who is facing a tough re-election race.
