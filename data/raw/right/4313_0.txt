 While pundits debate which candidate had a good showing and which had a bad showing at the first Democratic debates, Google analytics provided a technical measure that is a strong indicator of who won. 	The official Google Trends social media account tweeted that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had the greatest increase in searches on their online engine. Ten of the Democrats that met the qualifications for the debate battled it out in the first of two debates in Miami, Florida. The account posted a map of searches and indicated that although the Hawaiian congresswoman was the fourth most searched candidate ahead of the debate, but the top candidate searched during the debate.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had been the top candidate searched ahead of the debate. In second place was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and in third place was Beto O'Rourke. 	During the debate, Gabbard rocketed to the forefront, Booker maintained his second place status, while Warren slid to the third place spot. Many noted that the candidates of the debate did not attack the frontrunner in the primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), or the second place Warren, or even President Donald Trump. Trump followed through on his promise to live-tweet the debates, but he could only muster a one-word response: "BORING!"
