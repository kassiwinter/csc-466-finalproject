WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court extended its protection of student speech to social media on Wednesday, by an 8-1 ruling that a Pennsylvania school district overstepped its authority by punishing a high-school cheerleader who used a vulgar word on Snapchat when she didn’t make the varsity cheerleading team.The court said there are some occasions when schools can reach beyond campus to regulate student speech, mentioning bullying and cheating as subject to discipline whether they occur in the classroom or in cyberspace. But the court has long held that even on campus, students retain First Amendment rights to speak on controversial matters so long as they don’t cause a substantial disruption. Beyond school grounds, administrators’ power to punish students diminishes further still, Justice         Stephen Breyer    wrote for the court.     In this instance, “the school’s interest in teaching good manners is not sufficient, in this case, to overcome [the student’s] interest in free expression,” Justice Breyer wrote, joined by Chief Justice         John Roberts    and Justices         Samuel Alito,         Sonia Sotomayor,    Elena Kagan,         Neil Gorsuch,         Brett Kavanaugh    and Amy Coney Barrett.          The case stems from a May 2017 Snapchat post that Brandi Levy, then a high-school sophomore in Mahanoy City, Pa., sent to some 250 followers after failing to make the varsity cheerleading squad.     “F— school f— softball f— cheer f— everything,” the 14-year-old, frustrated at the prospect of another year on the junior-varsity team, wrote on her cellphone, posting a photo of herself and a friend extending middle fingers. The Snap automatically disappeared in 24 hours, but a screenshot of the message made its way to a cheerleading coach. Despite Ms. Levy’s apologies, the school then suspended her from the junior-varsity team for the school year, saying she had violated various rules including prohibitions of foul language, unsportsmanlike conduct and disrespect of the school.          “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy,” Justice Breyer wrote, something that requires a free exchange of ideas that ultimately shape public policy. “Putting aside the vulgar language” Ms. Levy used, he wrote, “the listener would hear criticism, of the team, the team’s coaches, and the school—in a word or two, criticism of the rules of a community of which [she] forms a part.”     Justice         Clarence Thomas    alone dissented. He argued that schools historically held expansive power over student expression, citing an 1859 decision by the Vermont Supreme Court against a student who called his teacher “old.” Such insubordination tended to “bring the master’s authority into contempt,” that court said. Likewise, Justice Thomas wrote, Ms. Levy’s Snap served to “subvert the [cheerleading coach’s] authority.”     Wednesday’s decision reaffirmed a high-water mark for student speech, the court’s 1969 decision siding with students who wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. “It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,” the court said in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District.     Subsequent decisions eroded student speech rights, however, and school authorities have focused on its passages upholding administrators’ power to discipline speech they consider disruptive.     After the Mahanoy school district refused to reconsider the punishment, Ms. Levy and her parents went to court. A federal district court ruled that the Snap couldn’t be considered disruptive under the Tinker standard; an appeals court in Philadelphia also sided with Ms. Levy, but its majority opinion held more broadly that schools couldn’t punish students for off-campus speech.      Justice Breyer’s opinion rejected that categorical rule, “particularly given the advent of computer-based learning” that increasingly has made school boundaries indeterminate. “We do not now set forth a broad, highly general First Amendment rule stating just what counts as ‘off campus’ speech and whether or how ordinary First Amendment standards must give way” to school needs, he wrote, reflecting the court’s typical caution when changing circumstances bring constitutional rules into question.     Nevertheless, he wrote, it was evident that features of off-campus speech diminish its potential threat to order in the classroom and thus lessen the justification for policing student expression. Schools rarely could be considered in loco parentis—that is, assuming the parent’s expansive responsibility to supervise children—when students are off-campus, he wrote.     Secondly, he warned, authorizing schools to police both on-campus and off-campus speech potentially includes “all the speech a student utters during the full 24-hour day.” In particular, he said, “when it comes to political or religious speech that occurs outside school or a school program or activity, the school will have a heavy burden to justify intervention.”     Newsletter Sign-up The 10-Point.

Finally, Justice Breyer said, public schools as civic institutions have a duty to teach by example that unpopular speech is entitled to protection, something less necessary for popular ideas. “Schools have a strong interest in ensuring that future generations understand the workings in practice of the well-known aphorism, ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,’” he wrote, adding that while “often attributed to Voltaire, it was likely coined by an English writer, Evelyn Beatrice Hall.”     “The school went too far, and I’m glad that the Supreme Court agrees,” Ms. Levy said Wednesday. “I was frustrated, I was 14 years old, and I expressed my frustration the way teenagers do today. Young people need to have the ability to express themselves without worrying about being punished when they get to school.”     The Mahanoy Area School District observed that the court pared back an appeals-court decision that schools lacked authority to punish off-campus speech altogether. “[W]e are very pleased that the Court agreed with our arguments about schools’ authority to address off-campus speech under a wide variety of situations,” the district said. “This decision is an important vindication of schools’ authority to protect students and staff and to fulfill schools’ educational missions.”     Ms. Levy’s case attracted support from a swath of civil-liberties and advocacy groups, both conservative and liberal, as well as young leaders, including more than 180 current and former student members of school boards in several states.     In Mahanoy City, however, many in the adult population apparently backed the school board’s line on student speech. The three board members seeking re-election took the top spots in last month’s primary election. Ms. Levy’s father, Larry Levy, who said he was running on a platform of “fiscal restraint and treating students fairly,” came in last of six candidates for four seats on the nine-member board.
