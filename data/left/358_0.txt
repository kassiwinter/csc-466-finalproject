 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tells CNN's "Out Front,"Â "I take responsibility" for the Mideast violence on Sept. 11, remarks coming on the heels of the VP debate in which Joe Biden suggested the White House hasn't known of requests for more security in Benghazi. In a clear nod to not only the election but the two debates coming in the next week, she added, "I want to avoid some kind of political gotcha."

She also cited "confusion" that follows any attack in determining what happened. Biden's comment has sparked a fresh round of criticism of and scrutiny over the Obama administration about what happened in the lead up to the attacks. The State Department had said it was aware of security requests, which Obama aides have had to explain over the last few days by saying it is always handled by State. But the situation, while not dominating the electorate, remains of concern to the White House.
