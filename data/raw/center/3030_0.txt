ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Who knows!”      Mr. Schumer confirmed the call and said the president told him he “wanted to make another run at repeal and replace,” using the Republican shorthand for rolling back the Affordable Care Act.     “I told the president that’s off the table,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “If he wants to work together to improve the existing health-care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.”               A Democratic aide said that bipartisan efforts were hampered by the administration’s move on Friday to scale back an Obama-era requirement that employer-provided health benefits include contraception.      The White House, asked for more information about the president’s call with Mr. Schumer, said it had “nothing more to add at this time.”      Senate GOP leaders late last month ended their latest bid to repeal the Affordable Care Act after the plan failed to gain sufficient traction. At the time, Mr. Trump said he planned to negotiate with Democrats on health-care legislation.      He also predicted that Republicans would hold a vote on health care early next year. GOP leaders said at the time that they were moving on to an effort to overhaul the tax code but would seek to revisit health care.     The outreach to Mr. Schumer marks the president’s latest effort to deal with Democrats as his frustration grows with his own party’s congressional leaders. Mr. Trump stunned Republicans last month when he overrode pleas from GOP congressional leaders and sided with Democrats on a proposal to attach emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey victims to measures to keep the government funded and its borrowing limit suspended until mid-December. In a subsequent dinner with Mr. Schumer and House Minority Leader      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.), Mr. Trump indicated he was open to a deal with Democrats on legislation that would give legal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.     Mr. Trump’s tweet on health care Saturday morning came amid a flurry of other online messages targeting late-night comedians and the news media.      Mr. Trump, who is spending a rare weekend at the White House, is set to head to North Carolina later Saturday for a fundraiser that will raise money for his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee. After tweeting on Saturday, he headed to his golf club in Virginia.
