Chao is married to the Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), perhaps the person most responsible for getting Trump’s initiatives passed on Capitol Hill.
Chao was part of a Bush Alumni Coalition that helped elect Trump, releasing a public letter in support of the Republican nominee in September. She served all eight years of the George W. Bush administration.
She met with President-elect Trump last week, on Nov. 21, at Trump Tower in Midtown to discuss a job in the administration.
