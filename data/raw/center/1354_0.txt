The Kentucky attorney general’s office released recordings of the grand jury proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case Friday, including officers’ testimony that they repeatedly knocked and announced themselves before entering her apartment.That issue is one of several points of contention in the wake of the grand jury’s decision last week in the case of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in March by Louisville police executing a search warrant at her apartment. The grand jury indicted one officer—former Detective         Brett Hankison    —on charges of wanton endangerment for firing into a neighboring apartment, but not the two officers—Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove—who officials say fatally shot Ms. Taylor. Attorney General         Daniel Cameron    has faced criticism for his handling of the case. Attorneys for Ms. Taylor’s family questioned whether Mr. Cameron presented all of the evidence and gave the grand jury the opportunity to consider homicide charges against the officers, or if his office decided on its own that such charges were unwarranted.     The roughly 15 hours of audio released Friday include witness testimony but not jurors’ deliberations or prosecutors’ recommendations or statements, which weren’t recorded, according to a statement released Friday by Mr. Cameron’s office.               In the recordings, Jeff Fogg, an investigator with the attorney general’s office, testified that the search warrant secured by Louisville police was a no-knock warrant—allowing officers to force their way into a residence without first announcing themselves. But it was executed as a “knock-and-announce” warrant, he said, meaning officers did alert who they were. They were looking for drugs or drug paraphernalia, he said.     “I knocked on the door, banged on it,” Sgt. Mattingly said in an interview by the police department’s Public Integrity Unit, which was presented as evidence. “Our intent was to give her plenty of time.”                                         Protests over a Kentucky grand jury decision in the Breonna Taylor case stretched into a third night on Friday in cities including Louisville, Ky., Los Angeles, New York and Boston.

Police, we have a search warrant.” Sgt. Mattingly estimated he banged on the door six or seven different times over the course of 45 seconds to a minute. While they did so, a neighbor upstairs said something like, “Leave that girl alone,” Sgt. Mattingly said.     When no one came to the door, police decided to breach it, he said. Each time they hit the door, he said, they announced, “Police, search warrant.” After forcing the door open, officers entered. Sgt. Mattingly said that as soon as he entered, he saw a man with a gun down a hallway—Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker—who shot him in the leg. He said he returned fire, six bullets in all.     Detective Cosgrove fired 16 rounds and Mr. Hankison 10 rounds, Mr. Fogg said.     Jurors also heard an interview with police Lt. Shawn Hoover, who was also present at Ms. Taylor’s apartment. Lt. Hoover told the Public Integrity Unit that officers twice knocked on Ms. Taylor’s front door and announced “Police,” pausing roughly 10 to 15 seconds between tries.     “We were like, we’ll just give them a chance to open the door. So that was kind of our thought process,” Lt. Hoover said. “It was loud enough that the neighbor above them come out.”     Testimony presented to the grand jury from Mr. Walker conveyed the fear he said he and Ms. Taylor felt that night. Mr. Walker told investigators the two were watching a movie when they heard loud banging at the door. Ms. Taylor repeatedly asked who it was, he said, but they heard nothing in response. They got up and put on clothes, and he grabbed his gun, which he said he has a license to carry.     “I’m scared to death,” Mr. Walker said. “She’s yelling at the top of her lungs, and I am too at this point. ‘Who is it?’ No answer, no response, no anything.”     As they exited the bedroom and headed down a hallway to the front door, the door came off the hinges, Mr. Walker said. He fired one shot, he said, but couldn’t see anything.     “All of a sudden, there’s a whole bunch of shots,” Mr. Walker said. He dropped to the ground along with Ms. Taylor. “She’s right here bleeding, and nobody is coming,” he said.     In the statement Friday, Mr. Cameron said, “I’m confident that once the public listens to the recordings, they will see that our team presented a thorough case to the Jefferson County grand jury.”     Civil-rights activists and attorneys for Ms. Taylor’s family had pressed for the release of the recording, since the grand jury rendered its decision in the case last week. They hoped the audio would clarify how Mr. Cameron’s office presented the case to the grand jury, including the evidence it provided and the potential charges it discussed.     Mr. Cameron, a Republican and the state’s first Black attorney general, said Monday that the only charge his office recommended to the grand jury was the one against Mr. Hankison, for wanton endangerment.     Federal courts, and the majority of state courts, require prosecutors to record witness testimony and the prosecutor’s instructions, said R. Michael Cassidy, a law professor at Boston College. Kentucky is one of a minority of states that only requires recording the testimony of witnesses, he said.     “It absolutely couldn’t come as a shock to this prosecutor that this is now a matter of public debate,” said Mr. Cassidy. “You can record it and not release it, or record and let a judge decide. But to not record it at all seems to be hiding behind your power.”              Daniel Goyette,    former chief public defender at the Louisville Metro Public Defender’s office, said that in his experience opening remarks and instructions by the prosecutor aren’t normally recorded, although there have been cases in which it has happened.     The recording of the grand jury proceedings was released under an order by Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who is presiding over Mr. Hankison’s case. At the request of Mr. Cameron’s office, the judge granted a two-day extension, until noon Friday, to allow time for the redaction of personal information of witnesses named in the recording.     Separately, a member of the grand jury filed a motion in state court on Monday citing concerns about how Mr. Cameron presented the case, and seeking the release of all recordings, transcripts and reports of the grand jury. The juror also asked the court for a declaration allowing members of the grand jury to disclose information and details about the proceedings. The motion is pending.     —Scott Calvert, Jacob Gershman, Cameron McWhirter, Corinne Ramey and Deanna Paul contributed to this article.
