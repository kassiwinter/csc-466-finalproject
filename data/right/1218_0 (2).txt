                                                                                                                                         Gov. Jan Brewer, Arizona Republican, says that she will “do the right thing” as she weighs a controversial bill that would allow businesses in the state to refuse services to gays and lesbians on religious grounds.                                                                                                                                                      “I can assure you, as always, I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona,” Mrs. Brewer told CNN.                                                                                                                                                      She has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill; absent action, it will become law.                                                                                                                                                                    “I’m going to go home, and when I receive the bill, I’m going to read it, and I’m going to be briefed on it. We have been following it. And I will make my decision in the near future,” Mrs. Brewer said.                                                                                                                   Arizona’s two Republican U.S. senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, are among those urging Mrs. Brewer to veto the bill. The conservative Center for Arizona Policy says the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts, CNN reported.
