                                          By Avery Anapol - 09/28/17 01:12 PM EDT                                                        Royal Caribbean has canceled an upcoming cruise in order to send a ship to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on a mission to help hurricane victims.The Adventure of the Seas, which can carry 3,114 passengers, will forgo its scheduled Saturday voyage and travel to San Juan, St. Croix and St. Thomas on Friday to pick up evacuees and bring supplies.A spokesman for Royal Caribbean told the Miami Herald that the cruise line expects to pick up more than 3,000 people, taking them back to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.The cruise line sent ships to St. Thomas and St. Martin to rescue a total of 1,700 people after Hurricane Irma struck the area.According to the Miami Herland, travelers on the canceled voyage will get a full refund.President Trump said earlier this week that the federal government has had difficulty getting aid to Puerto Rico, compared to other U.S. areas hit by hurricanes in the past month, because it is an island."This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean, this is tough stuff,” Trump said.After pressure from lawmakers, Trump announced Thursday that he would temporarily suspend the Jones Act, easing shipping restrictions that have been stifling relief efforts.
