                            	Facebook/Getty             	Ray Roseberry            Ray Roseberry was identified as the North Carolina Donald Trump supporter who was streaming on Facebook Live while talking about Joe Biden and revolution from a truck during an active bomb threat investigation near the Library of Congress.“It’s time to take a stand. Well mother f***ers, I’m here today. I’m setting the foundation. And if all you mother f***ers want to sit at home and explain to your kids why you didn’t go up there, you can do that,” he said in one video. “I’m good with it. But for me, that ain’t what I am. I’m an American Patriot. This platform is going to be built and when it’s built, you’ll know it…I’m a Patriot. My family fought the war. My uncle was in special services. He lost his legs. What did he do? He went back and served 10 more years. This world’s f***ed up…the Southern boys are here.” He said if Biden took him out, it would start a chain reaction. “The f***ing American people sent me here. I’m here to take a stand.”You can watch the videos throughout this article. The Facebook page has now been taken down, hours after he started streaming. His full name is Floyd Ray Roseberry, 49, from Grover, North Carolina, although he went by Ray Roseberry on Facebook. YouTube has also been removing some of Roseberry’s videos. A photo from the scene showed that he threw money out of the pickup truck as parts of the Capitol complex were evacuated and law enforcement responded en masse. It’s not clear whether Roseberry actually had a bomb. Snipers were at the scene.Roseberry then surrendered. “Suspect in custody,” police wrote on Twitter.Before he did, Tom Manger, the Capitol police chief, said in a news conference that, around 9:15 a.m., a man in a black pickup truck drove on the sidewalk near the Library of Congress. The driver told the responding officer that he had a bomb and the officer said the man had what appeared to be a detonator in his hand. “We immediately evacuated the nearby building,” Manger said. Police have not identified Roseberry, but his name is attached to the Facebook page from which he streamed the live videos.Here is one of his main videos. It’s more than 30 minutes long.

“Guys I found me a place to park,” he said in one video. “All right guys. Looks to me like I’m getting ready to make a phone call.” He said at one point that “five of us are already here,” although it’s not clear if that’s true. “I’m ready to die for the cause.”           getfvid 53481929 1407844366260438 7928247256392175913 n2021-08-19T18:29:21Z   Manger said police responded “to a disturbance call.” He said the House and Senate are on recess. He said negotiations were ongoing, and he didn’t want to go into detail on that. “My negotiators are hard at work trying to have a peaceful resolution to this incident,” Manger said. He noted that law enforcement was aware of reports that the man was livestreaming on Facebook.Facebook
In one of his live stream videos, Roseberry said, “the South is coming for you.” He is a Trump voter, who voted for the first time in his life for the former president, his wife told NBC Washington’s Tom Lynch.“They keep allowing these illegal Mexicans in here,” he said in one video. “All these illegal immigrants from Afghanistan. You don’t have free health care for us. You’re f***ing giving it to them. Joe Biden, the South is fed up. And it isn’t because we don’t love everybody. My heart goes out to everybody even animals. When I run over a rabbit, I have to go back and throw it out of the road to make sure it doesn’t get run over again. I deer hunt…I’ve always been taught. You don’t kill nothing you don’t eat.” He lamented a lack of health insurance. He said superstar athletes could get healthcare, but he couldn’t get shots for his back.https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/getfvid_10000000_212709917477648_7877065252580968328_n.mp4
“People think it’s a joke but they cleared the block,” Roseberry said in one of the live videos. “They need to get Joe Biden down here. I’m not hurting nobody Joe. I’m not pulling the trigger on this thing. I can’t – there’s no way for me to blow this up. Only you can by shooting a bullet through my window. You don’t want to do it Joe. I love this land. We got a few options here Joe. You shoot me, this two and a half blocks is going with it. You’re talking about a revolution? The revolution is on. It’s here. It’s today.”https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/getfvid_10000000_375226970795463_6738912774200055958_n.mp4
