SINGAPORE—President      Donald Trump        and North Korean leader      Kim Jong Un        arrived here to set the groundwork for a high-stakes summit that could reshape the security environment in Asia, amid questions about whether the talks will be more substance or symbolism. Tuesday’s scheduled face-to-face meeting—the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader—follows months of hurled insults and tumultuous diplomacy aimed at ultimately reaching a denuclearization agreement on the Korean Peninsula. North Korean state media reported on Monday that Mr. Kim outlined goals for the summit, including establishing new relations between the two countries and building a permanent peacekeeping mechanism, as well as denuclearization.     Mr. Trump, who has used sweeping economic sanctions to press North Korea to abandon its atomic arsenal, has of late played down the likelihood of a rapid solution to the standoff.               The president, who clashed with important U.S. allies in the Group of Seven industrial nations over trade and tariffs over the weekend, told reporters he expected it “will take a period of time” to achieve a deal. “At a minimum, I do believe, at least we’ll have met each other,” he said. “Hopefully we will have liked each other and we’ll start that process.”        
Related        Mr. Kim is currently scheduled to depart Singapore at 2 p.m. Tuesday, just five hours after his summit with Mr. Trump is set to begin, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Trump is set to leave on Wednesday morning, this person added.     A senior U.S. official cautioned against hopes for a breakthrough in Singapore such as a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, which ended in an armistice. “A peace treaty comes way down the road,” the official said.     Mr. Trump’s framing of the summit as a “get-to-know-you” meeting marks a comedown in expectations from late April, when he batted away the notion that he would accept anything less than the U.S.’s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.     “It would be very easy for me to make a simple deal and claim victory,” he told reporters at the time. “I don’t want to do that. I want them to get rid of their nukes.”     For North Korea, the aim has been clear and consistent, said         Thae Yong Ho,    Pyongyang’s deputy ambassador to London until he defected to South Korea two years ago.                                        “It’s hard to see how a small nation like North Korea could ever garner this kind of international attention had it not been for their nuclear threat”                                                                                             In a memoir published in May, Mr. Thae wrote that Pyongyang’s goal has long been to be recognized as a de facto nuclear state, like India and Pakistan.      At a meeting of North Korea’s diplomats in Pyongyang in 2016, senior North Korean officials agreed to complete the country’s nuclear program by 2017, followed by a diplomatic detente beginning in 2018.     “The 2018 peace initiative by Kim Jong Un is to present the world with a fait accompli,” Mr. Thae wrote, adding that Pyongyang’s leadership feared that international sanctions would result in “considerable damage” if left in place.     In late April, a week before his first meeting with South Korean President         Moon Jae-in    at the inter-Korean demilitarized zone, Mr. Kim convened an emergency meeting of the central committee of North Korea’s ruling party, declaring the completion of the North’s nuclear program and vowing to work together with other nuclear states to “make positive contributions to the building of the world free from nuclear weapons.”     It remains unclear how much progress has been made toward narrowing the gap between Pyongyang, which prefers a phased approach to disarmament in exchange for concessions from the U.S. and others, and Washington, which wants a rapid surrender of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities.                                         Behind the modernized facade of Pyongyang, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un rules one of the world’s most repressive states. And he has proven to be far more brutal and strategic than anticipated.

A senior North Korean official hand-delivered a letter from Mr. Kim to Mr. Trump this month.     In May, Mr. Kim turned over three U.S. citizens who had been detained in North Korea for more than a year, and at the end of the month, blew up the site of the country’s six nuclear tests, in an attempt at good faith whose disarmament value was questioned by independent experts. But North Korea has continued to defy sanctions through ship-to-ship oil transfers, while conducting hacking operations against South Korea.     Recurring tensions on both sides prompted Mr. Trump to temporarily call off his meeting with Mr. Kim in May, most directly after a pair of statements published by North Korean state media taking aim at remarks by Vice President      Mike Pence        and national-security adviser         John Bolton.         Since then, North Korea has lashed out at South Korean conservative politicians as well as journalists who have questioned Pyongyang’s motives in seeking dialogue, but steered clear of any attacks on Mr. Trump’s close advisers.     It didn’t weigh in on remarks from Mr. Trump’s lawyer         Rudy Giuliani    last week that Mr. Kim had begged “on his hands and knees” for the summit.

In recent months, Mr. Kim has embarked on a flurry of diplomacy, meeting Mr. Moon and Chinese President         Xi Jinping    twice each. He has meetings planned with Russian President      Vladimir Putin        and Syrian leader         Bashar al-Assad,    and on Sunday afternoon, met with Singaporean Prime Minister         Lee Hsien Loong    at the presidential office.     “It’s hard to see how a small nation like North Korea could ever garner this kind of international attention had it not been for their nuclear threat,” said         Lindsey Ford,    a former senior adviser to the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs.     Ms. Ford, now director of political-security affairs for the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, added: “We have to assume other nations could watch what’s happening here and draw the conclusion that behaving badly seems to pay off a whole lot more than playing nice.”     Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com, Andrew Jeong at andrew.jeong@wsj.com and Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
