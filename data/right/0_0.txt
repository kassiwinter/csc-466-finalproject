                                                 The Washington Times - September 19, 2012, 08:52AM                                                               	Americans are growing increasingly optimistic about the economy and   see President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney as equally capable of overseeing   its recovery, according to a poll released Wednesday.                                                          An NBC/Wall   Street Journal poll shows that 42 percent of voters expect the economy  to improve over the next 12 months — the highest percentage  since  2009 — and that 43 percent of voters think Mr. Obama would  handle the  economy better than Mr. Romney,  compared with  43 percent who say the GOP candidate would do the better job.                                                       SEE RELATED:                                                             The results  are a departure from polls throughout the race that consistently have shown that Americans think Mr. Romney is better equipped  to handle the economy.                                                          The poll, which surveyed 736 likely voters over the past week, also showed Mr. Obama with a 50-45 lead in the popular vote.                                                          While   the poll showed both candidates as even on the economy, Mr. Obama   held significant edges in dealing with women’s issues and looking out   for the middle class, and smaller edges in being a good   commander-in-chief, dealing with Medicare and dealing with taxes.                                                          The  poll’s one bit of bad news for the president was that approval of  his handling of foreign policy has slipped in the wake of ongoing unrest  in  the Middle East. Just 49 percent of voters said they approve of  Mr.  Obama’s foreign policy, down from 54 percent last month and his  lowest  figure since November 2010.
