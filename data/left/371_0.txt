  A reporter was fired over her story that incorrectly claimed President Trump spent Thanksgiving golfing and tweeting — even though she says she was assigned the story in advance and her editor failed to rework it after the president made an unannounced secret trip to Afghanistan.  Jessica Kwong was terminated by Newsweek after Trump and Donald Trump Jr. mocked the botched story on Twitter.   She told a reporter that she filed the story as instructed by her editors on Wednesday, based on Trump’s expected activities for the holiday. The story was headlined “How Did Trump Spend Thanksgiving? Tweeting, Golfing and More.”    Kwong, who covers the Trump White House and the 2020 election, was not scheduled to work on Thanksgiving.  Her editor found out in the late afternoon along with the rest of the world that Trump had actually taken a secret trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops.   The editor updated the story with some new information about the Afghanistan trip but still incorrectly kept the claim that he had been golfing or on social media.  Donald Trump Jr. joked that the inaccurate story shows that “Fake News gonna fake.” The president dissed Kwong’s bosses saying “I thought Newsweek was out of business?”
