GENEVA—The U.S. and Russia began efforts to dismantle Syria's chemical arms network, building on an uncertain pledge by President         Bashar al-Assad    to join the international treaty banning the use and production of such weapons.But Moscow's ability to control Mr. Assad as the disarmament process moves forward emerged as a major issue Thursday, after the Syrian leader said he would hold up plans to surrender his chemical weapons unless the Obama administration stopped threatening to use military force if Damascus didn't comply. "The U.S. needs to stop its policy of threats against Syria," Mr. Assad told Russian state television.      It wasn't clear if the Syrian leader was putting forward conditions for a deal or trying to project defiance to a domestic audience. Since Monday, the Syrian regime has sought to portray the Russian initiative as a tactical victory for Damascus and Moscow.

Related Articles                In another potential wrinkle to talks, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations reiterated a longstanding call for Israel to declare its presumed nuclear-weapons arsenal and to put it under international supervision.                The developments rattled the opening of meetings between Secretary of State         John Kerry    and Russian Foreign Minister         Sergei Lavrov    in Geneva and provoked a stern warning from Mr. Kerry.     "This is not a game, and I said that to my friend Sergei when we talked about it initially," Mr. Kerry said at a news event with his Russian counterpart in Geneva. "It has to be timely and implemented in a timely fashion. And finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place."     The Pentagon, backing up Mr. Kerry's strategy, said on Thursday that two U.S. warships deployed in the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea would stay beyond their scheduled deployments to keep pressure on Syria while talks over its chemical weapons continue.     The USS Barry, one of four destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, originally was scheduled to return home around Labor Day, but will be kept in place. The USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea that was to leave the Middle East for the Pacific region, also will remain.      While the Nimitz has been formally extended for two weeks, a Pentagon official said both ships would remain in the area for the foreseeable future.     Syria, taking a first step, sent a letter to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announcing Damascus's decision to join the Chemical Weapon Convention—the 1997 treaty banning the production and use of chemical weapons.      Under the Russian plan, according to U.S. and Russian officials, Syria will now need to declare the location and extent of Damascus's stockpile to The Hague-based body charged with dismantling chemical-weapons programs. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors would then probe the weapons sites and agree with Syria on a schedule to destroy the arms.

A Thousand Days of an 'Arab Spring'Thursday marks 1,000 days after a fruit seller set himself on fire in Tunisia on Dec. 17, 2010, triggering protests that gave rise to the so-called Arab Spring.                 
Syria in the SpotlightTrack the latest events in a map, see the key players and a chronology of the unrest.           Messrs. Kerry and Lavrov pledged to work closely on implementing this plan, but divisions between the U.S. and Russia emerged.     The U.S. is backing a push by France for a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the use of force against Syria if Mr. Assad backs away from its disarmament commitments. Mr. Lavrov said in Geneva that the threat of military strikes should now be off the table.     "We proceed from the fact that the solution on this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the Syrian Arab Republic," Mr. Lavrov said.     Mr. Kerry, meanwhile, voiced concerns that Syria would try to use the Russian initiative to stall for time while continuing its military offensive against rebels. The American diplomat dismissed Mr. Assad's claims that procedurally he has 30 days to declare his weapons arsenal.      "We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved," Mr. Kerry said. American officials say Moscow's ability to control Mr. Assad is a major question for the U.S. delegation. The 48-year-old Syrian leader, since taking power in 2000, has proved to be much more erratic than his late father, President         Hafez al-Assad,    U.S. and Arab officials said. The younger Assad tightened ties with Iran and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, and has taken reckless steps to fortify Syria's military, the officials said.     In addition to chemical weapons, U.S. and U.N. officials believe Mr. Assad was close to producing weapons-grade plutonium for nuclear weapons in 2007, before Israeli jets destroyed a Syrian reactor on the Euphrates River. U.S. intelligence officials also believe Mr. Assad transferred Scud-missile technologies to Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.     Mr. Kerry made it clear to Mr. Lavrov that Russia's reputation was now on the line over its ability to rein in Mr. Assad.      "Expectations are high. They are high for the United States, perhaps even more so for Russia to deliver on the promise of this moment," Mr. Kerry said.     Both diplomats arrived in Geneva accompanied by large teams of American and Russian experts on arms control and disarmament procedures.      Mr. Kerry presented to Mr. Lavrov Washington's assessment of the size and location of Mr. Assad's chemical-weapons stockpile, said U.S. officials traveling with the diplomat.      This assessment included Syria's store of "precursor" chemicals mixed to create weapons, the arms themselves, and munitions and delivery systems. The Obama administration estimates that Syria has more than 1,000 tons of mustard gas and sarin and VX nerve agents.     Messrs. Kerry and Lavrov won't discuss the creation of the U.N. Security Council resolution, but instead will seek to put in place a clear timeline to disband Syria's chemicals arms and the benchmarks that will be used to judge success. The two sides will also discuss how to install inspection teams and provide them with the security needed to operate within a country consumed by civil war.      U.S. officials said negotiators want Russian work in Syria to be verified by an international team because Washington doesn't fully trust Moscow's intentions and doubts it has enough information about the secretive Syrian program to do the job credibly.      "The Russians have a lot of blind spots on the Syrian chemical-weapons program. They may not understand the full scope of what they are dealing with," a senior U.S. official said.     Mr. Kerry also met Thursday with the U.N.'s special envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi has been working with Washington and Moscow to try to hold an international conference in Geneva aimed at putting in place a political transition in Syria. The conference is envisaged to bring together representatives of the Syrian opposition and Mr. Assad's government. But months of planning for the conference have failed to gain the approval of either warring side.     "We hope that once [the Americans] have done what they have to do with the Russians on the chemical issue, we will start talking again about Geneva," Mr. Brahimi said after meeting Mr. Kerry.     —Gregory L.
