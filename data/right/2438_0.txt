                                                                                                                                         GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday he’s not “flip-flopping” on immigration, calling for a “fair but firm” answer and saying that “we have to be very, very strong” when people enter the country illegally.                                                                                                                                                      “No, I’m not flip-flopping — we want to come up with a really fair but firm answer. It has to be very firm,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “But we want to come up with something fair.”                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Trump, who has made building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and mass deportations of illegal immigrants cornerstones of his campaign, met with members of a National Hispanic Advisory Council over the weekend.                                                                                                                                                                    “These were great people. These are highly respected people within the community — unbelievable people,” Mr. Trump said.                                                                                                                              “We’re dealing with people. We have to be very firm; we have to be very, very strong when people come in illegally,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                 “We have a lot of people that want to come in through the legal process. It’s not fair for them, and we’re working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer,” Mr. Trump said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Asked if Mr. Trump’s immigration plans include a “deportation force,” which he previously mentioned, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN Sunday that’s “to be determined.”
