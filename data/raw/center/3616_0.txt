         Paul Manafort’s    longtime associate, Richard Gates, testified Monday at the criminal trial of the former Trump campaign chairman that the two men committed tax and bank fraud together.“Did you commit crimes with Mr. Manafort?” prosecutor Greg Andres asked Mr. Gates, as Mr. Manafort stared at him from his defense table.“I did,” Mr. Gates said. In much-anticipated testimony, Mr. Gates said he had made wire transfers from offshore accounts controlled by Mr. Manafort in Cyprus and other countries, but hid that information from Mr. Manafort’s accountants and bookkeepers, which he said he did “at Mr. Manafort’s request.”               Mr. Gates was on the stand for about 90 minutes, but is expected to continue his testimony for much of Tuesday, which is expected to be key for the prosecution’s case in Mr. Manafort’s trial.      His cross-examination is also likely to be a crucial moment for the defense, as Mr. Manafort’s legal team has blamed Mr. Gates for the misdeeds, saying he misled and embezzled from his former employer.         The Manafort Trial        On Monday, Mr. Gates admitted he had added money to his expense reports over the course of his employment at Mr. Manafort’s firm, receiving “several hundred thousand” dollars in money he didn’t earn.     He also admitted to inflating his income on mortgage and credit-card applications, and lying on his own tax returns, by transferring some income to an account in the United Kingdom and not reporting that.      Mr. Gates’s testimony echoed several days of testimony from Mr. Manafort’s bookkeeper and accountant, who said they weren’t told of any foreign accounts or payments from them. That, in turn, followed accounts from multiple high-end vendors who said Mr. Manafort paid them often through international wire transfers from Cypriot accounts.                                         Paul Manafort’s first of two trials is underway, and he’s facing 18 counts related to bank and tax fraud.

On Monday, Mr. Gates admitted he had provided the forged documents, and said he didn’t benefit from them.     Mr. Gates pleaded guilty earlier this year in connection with the case against Mr. Manafort and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.     He could face around five years in prison, but potentially will be able to request a sentence of probation based on his cooperation, according to his plea agreement.     Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges of bank and tax fraud.                                                 Richard Gates, former associate to Paul Manafort, is seen in Washington on Feb. 23.

The 46-year-old Mr. Gates then described how he had started working at Mr. Manafort’s prior firm as an intern in 1995, left for several other jobs, and returned to work with Mr. Manafort in 2006, as his political consulting firm’s work was taking off in Ukraine.     Wealthy Ukrainian businessmen paid from their accounts in Cyprus into accounts that Mr. Gates said he helped set up there for Mr. Manafort.     He described Mr. Manafort as “one of the most politically brilliant strategists” he had worked with, and said Mr. Manafort was responsible for resurrecting the political fortunes of former Ukraine president         Viktor Yanukovych,    who came to office in 2010 with Mr. Manafort’s help. “He brought him back from the proverbial political dead,” Mr. Gates said.     Earlier in the afternoon, Mr. Manafort’s tax preparer read aloud from a document that showed Mr. Manafort had reported around $31 million in income on his taxes between 2010 through 2014, around half of the $60 million prosecutors alleged he made over that time.     Under cross-examination from defense attorney Kevin Downing, the tax preparer, Cindy Laporta, also said that Mr. Manafort’s firm had paid around $8 million in federal income tax between 2005 and 2015.     She also testified that Mr. Manafort’s firm had reported millions of dollars in loans from international sources. Prosecutors have zeroed in on several such loans, which they allege were actually income—not loans—but were miscategorized to reduce Mr. Manafort’s tax bill. Mr. Downing’s line of questioning appeared aimed at showing such loans weren’t unusual and not improper.     As he has through much of the trial, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis chided the prosecutors, urging them to be concise. After the jury was dismissed Monday evening, Judge Ellis and Mr. Andres engaged in a contentious back-and-forth that lasted more than 10 minutes.     Judge Ellis repeatedly chastised Mr. Andres for not making eye contact and accused at least one of the government lawyers of rolling their eyes.     Mr. Andres was visibly frustrated, saying, “You continue to interpret our reactions in some way.”     Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
