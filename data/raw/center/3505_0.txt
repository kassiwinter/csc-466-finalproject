And like all presidents, he wants it done now. But we’re part of the legislative process, it’s slower and deliberate,” Shelby told Politico.The government last shut down for three days in January as a temporary spending bill stalled in Congress.Trump's hard-line stance over his border wall comes as his administration faces overwhelming opposition from Republicans and Democrats to its "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which has led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents.Trump has refused to cave on the policy, blaming Democrats for it. Other administration officials have said it falls on Congress to address the issue, despite the Trump administration implementing the zero tolerance policy.The House is expected to vote soon on a pair of GOP immigration bills that include broader reforms. Meanwhile, some members of Congress have crafted legislation that would specifically end the practice of family separation.
