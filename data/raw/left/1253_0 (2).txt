In an appearance on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher, Arianna skewered Republicans for their continued efforts to turn Benghazi into a scandal. Earlier this week, the House voted to create a new committee to investigate the 2012 attack in Libya. Both Senate and House Republicans have been using the tragedy as a way to appeal to potential donors to their 2014 election campaigns.Arianna asked:"What is the opportunity cost of having had 13 hearings on Benghazi, tens of thousands of pages, and all this attention being given to an issue which is basically the equivalent of saying Nero held Benghazi hearings while Rome burned, the captain of the Titanic held Benghazi hearings while the iceberg was hitting the Titanic?" She pointed out that the time spent discussing Benghazi could be better spent talking about more pressing issues."We have climate change, we have growing inequality, we have all these problems and we're ignoring them compared to Benghazi."Watch the clip below:Arianna also discussed the Iraq War and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
