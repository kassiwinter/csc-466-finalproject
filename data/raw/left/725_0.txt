  New York City saw 112 people die from coronavirus in just 25 hours as the number of cases grew to more than 36,000 on Monday morning.  There were 36,221 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the five boroughs by 10:30 a.m. Monday, a 12% increase from 32,308 at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, according to Health Department data.  So far the virus has killed 790 people in the city, with the death toll climbing 16.5% from 678 fatalities on Sunday morning.  Officials have cautioned that the actual number of people infected with coronavirus in the city is likely far higher than the confirmed cases. This is partially because New Yorkers with mild symptoms are told to stay home so they don’t further overwhelm the city’s hospital system, so they may not get tested and still have the virus. And thousands more will not show symptoms at all or assume they have a cold or another illness.   Fifty-two percent of confirmed cases were in people under the age of 50. The median age of those infected is 48.  Queens has the highest share of confirmed coronavirus cases, with at least 11,868 infected, followed by 9,521 in Brooklyn, 6,830 in the Bronx, 5,877 in Manhattan and 2,091 on Staten Island. Queens also had the highest number of people to die from coronavirus as of Monday morning, with 256 fatalities.   The vast majority of people who have succumbed to the disease so far are over 65 years old and have underlying medical conditions like diabetes, lung disease, immunodeficiency and cancer.  Just over 80% or at least 639 of those infected have at least one preexisting condition, health data shows. Of those who’ve died, 374 people were 75 and older, 185 were aged 65 to 74 and 189 were 45 to 64 years old.  Forty-one people who have died were 18 to 44 years old. Only one person 17 years old and younger has died of coronavirus in the city so far.
