WASHINGTON—Supporters of a budget agreement worked over the weekend to secure the necessary votes in the Senate to approve the two-year deal, which they expect will pass—but by a much narrower margin than it won in the House last week.Sen.         Richard Durbin    of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, said on Sunday he feels there will be strong Democratic support for the bill, but hasn't yet secured the Republican votes needed to clear a key procedural hurdle this week. Senate leaders "have a handful," but need more, he said, adding that getting those votes could be tricky.                                                 Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray announce a budget deal last week that would boost spending by $62 billion.          Associated Press                                                                                                             House Budget Chairman         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) has been calling Republican senators to urge them to support the deal. Mr. Ryan "is confident the Senate will build on the overwhelming vote in the House and approve the agreement," a spokesman said Sunday.     Speaking on CBS, Mr. Durbin said "the problems we have are twofold." He said he spoke with "one or two" Republicans in recent days who face tough votes because of re-election threats from candidates backed by the tea party. Some Republican senators also are thinking about the vote in the context of a potential presidential run, Mr. Durbin said.               The procedural vote requires 60 votes to move forward, so support from at least five Republicans would be needed if all 55 members of the Democratic caucus were to support it. Some Democrats have reservations about the bill and could vote against it because it doesn't include an extension of expiring unemployment benefits, but all are likely to vote to overcome the procedural hurdle.     Republicans interviewed recently said they expect the procedural move and the budget bill itself to get enough votes even though the Senate Republican leadership hasn't actively advocated for or against the bill.     Sen.         Mike Johanns    (R., Neb.) predicted Friday that the budget would pass. "At the end of the day, if you believe in my crystal ball, this gets the votes," he said.     Many Senate GOP leaders are expected to vote against the spending bill, but are surveying members to see if its passage is in jeopardy, a senior GOP aide said. Even some Republicans who have expressed reservations are concerned about the economic and political consequences of defeating it. Democrat strategists refer to this as the "vote no, hope yes" faction.     One Republican vote for the bill will come from Sen.         John McCain    (R., Ariz.), who said on Sunday he would support the legislation as it stands and hopes it will pass the Senate. "We must not shut down the government again," Mr. McCain said on CNN.     The deal, negotiated by Mr. Ryan and Sen.         Patty Murray    (D., Wash.), passed the House 332-94 last week, with 169 Republican and 163 Democratic votes.     The budget agreement calls for increasing spending for domestic and military programs by $62 billion in the current and next fiscal years above current spending caps. To avoid increasing the deficit in the long term, the spending increases were paired with an array of revenue hikes and offsets that would kick in over 10 years, leading to a projected net $23 billion of deficit reduction.     In a joint appearance on NBC, Ms. Murray and Mr. Ryan defended the deal as a step in the right direction, even if it falls short of their respective parties' goals.     "We can't take on the tough discussions unless we can learn to use the word 'compromise,' " said Ms. Murray, who said that if lawmakers just yell at each other they'll never get to big discussions about "tax reform, or strengthening our entitlements, or how we fund things in the future, or immigration reform," among other things. Still, she acknowledged opposition from members of her party.      Mr. Ryan called the deal a "symbolically" large agreement that avoids two government shutdowns and suggested it could lead to further bipartisan talks. He and Ms. Murray concluded that if one of them requires the other to violate a core principle, "we're going to get nowhere and we'll just keep gridlock," he said.     To be sure, the budget deal didn't address the debt-ceiling issue, which will have to be dealt with in February or March. Mr. Ryan, who also appeared on Fox in a pretaped interview, told host         Chris Wallace    that Republicans will meet after the holidays to discuss what steps they want to take in the debt-limit fight.     —Janet Hook and       Kristina Peterson       contributed to this article.
