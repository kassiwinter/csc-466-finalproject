NEW YORK—It was a sight that even those anticipating a competitive New York presidential primary on Tuesday hadn’t expected to witness: Republican candidate Ted Cruz in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn belting out “Dayenu,” the traditional Passover Seder song.With New York’s many delegates in play this year, candidates from both parties have sought to court Jewish voters, a population known for its high turnout. New York contains the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside Israel. “It’s part and parcel of New York being in play—when was the last time you saw a presidential primary candidate in Brooklyn baking matzos?” said Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Columbia University who worked as a special adviser to former New York City Mayor         Michael Bloomberg.    “I can’t remember in a primary, in my voting lifetime, seeing this.”     In the past week, both Mr. Cruz and GOP rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich have made pilgrimages to Brooklyn matzo bakeries. The Texas senator graces the cover of the current issue of Ami Magazine, a publication that caters to the Orthodox Jewish community.               The Cruz campaign’s outreach to New York Jews “has been very systematic and very well-concentrated and very targeted over the last year,” including reaching out to former Sen.         Marco Rubio    voters, said Michael Fragin, a New York-based Republican political operative whose work focuses on the Jewish community. He is unaffiliated with any campaign.     Of the magazine cover, Mr. Fragin said: “He will be on [the] Shabbos reading list of many Orthodox Jewish families this weekend.”                                         Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton came out swinging in Thursday's debate in Brooklyn, N.Y. But did either candidate make a big enough impression to change the race? WSJ's Politics Editor Jeanne Cummings explains.

On Tuesday, a group of 12 Jewish New York City Council members announced their support for Mrs. Clinton, saying “she helped build an international coalition to put in place the toughest sanctions in Iran’s history, and at every turn, she has been a steadfast supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself against Jihadist threats.”     Her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has encountered a backlash over his recent comments to the New York Daily News editorial board in which he overstated the number of Palestinians killed in the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, as well as for his absence at this year’s American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference.     His campaign suffered another setback this week after it suspended his national Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, over social media posts containing derogatory references to Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    and Mrs. Clinton.     And during a Brooklyn debate on Thursday, Mr. Sanders broke from the language that most major Democratic and Republican candidates use on the campaign trail when he questioned the actions of the Israeli government and expressed his sympathy for Palestinians. “I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people,” he said. “That does not make me anti-Israel.”                                                                                                                                                     Among likely Jewish Democratic primary voters in New York, Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist College poll released Thursday. Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Sanders by 65% to 32%, the poll found. Jewish voters, who are predominantly Democrats, constituted about 16% of the likely Democratic primary voter sample.     In the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in New York, Jews constituted about 16% of voters, according to Ms. Fuchs.     Mr. Sanders has also raised eyebrows for what some in the community perceive as his failure to publicly embrace his Jewish identity. Some of his supporters, however, say such criticism is hypocritical.     “I think it’s unfair, in some ways, that this is the way he’s being cast,” said Daniel Sieradski, founder of the PAC Jews for Bernie. “The vast majority of American Jews are secular.”     David Greenfield, an Orthodox New York City councilman who is one of those backing Mrs. Clinton, said he believes Mr. Sanders’s religion has worked against him in the Jewish community. “I think identity politics only matter if the person shares your values and beliefs as well, and I think in this case he doesn’t share them, especially in the case of supporting Israel,” Mr. Greenfield said. “It’s even more offensive that he’s Jewish and hasn’t been supportive of Israel.”

Republican front-runner      Donald Trump        on Thursday met privately with representatives of Jewish media outlets for interviews in his Trump Tower office in Midtown.     Unlike his GOP opponents, he hasn’t been campaigning in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods, though many political operatives believe his son-in-law,         Jared Kushner,    who helped write Mr. Trump’s AIPAC speech, has been doing outreach in such communities.     On the GOP side, Mr. Fragin expressed surprise that most candidates had flocked to the areas of Borough Park, Midwood or Brighton Beach, which contain large numbers of Jewish registered Democrats, instead of traveling to the south shore of Long Island, Rockland County or the village of Kiryas Joel, where there are thousands of registered Orthodox Republicans.     Leah Winner, the youth program director at Chabad Neshama Center, where Mr. Cruz made his appearance, said it had been “very important” for a presidential candidate like Mr. Cruz to have visited.     Asked if Mr. Cruz was familiar with Jewish traditions, she said: “I’m not going to lie. Somewhat.”     Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
