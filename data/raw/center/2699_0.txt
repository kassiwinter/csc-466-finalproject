PALM BEACH, Fla.—President      Donald Trump        called together several top advisers Saturday, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and political strategist Steve Bannon, as the White House faced a growing furor over the president’s early morning claims he had been wiretapped by his predecessor.Mr. Trump, who is spending the weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club here, added a meeting with Mr. Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to his calendar on Saturday, as political allies and foes of the president continued to react to the president’s claim on Twitter.

Mr. Trump tweeted early Saturday morning that former President         Barack Obama    had tapped his phones at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump lived and worked in New York during the campaign, but provided no evidence for what amounted to an extraordinary claim of illegal activity by a former president.     The tweets used strong language and compared Mr. Obama to Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the victory,” Mr. Trump tweeted at 6:35 a.m. “Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”                His postings also referred to Mr. Obama as a “bad (or sick) guy,” compared any such phone tapping to the Watergate scandal, and suggested that “a good lawyer could make a great case” of the matter.               Public officials, including some of Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans, reacted sharply to the allegation. A spokesman for Mr. Obama said “neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”     The White House didn’t provide clarification on what Mr. Trump may have been referring to or what evidence he had for his claims, though a recent article on the Breitbart website made similar allegations about the Obama administration. The furor threatened to overshadow a crucial upcoming week for Mr. Trump, in which he is scheduled to release a revised executive order on immigration and Republican-led congressional committees are set to begin producing health-care legislation.          Mr. Trump had been scheduled to dine Saturday evening with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at Mar-a-Lago. In an update, the president’s staff said the two also would be joined by Messrs. Sessions, Bannon and Kelly, as well as policy adviser Stephen Miller and the White House counsel, Don McGahn, turning the dinner into a session of the president’s inner circle.     The meeting came as some prominent Republicans joined Democrats in calling on the president to explain his claims. Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a written statement Saturday that Mr. Trump should “explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this.”     Mr. Sasse said the president’s statement suggests he may have been illegally tapped, or the courts may have approved a legal wiretap out of national security concerns, which would raise its own set of questions. “We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the president’s allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots,” Mr. Sasse said.     Earlier in the day, Sen.         Lindsey Graham    (R., S.C.), told an audience at Clemson University that Mr. Trump’s claim of having been illegally wiretapped, if true, would be “the biggest scandal since Watergate.” He added that he was also “very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments.”     Rep. Justin Amash (R., Mich.), also called on Mr. Trump to share any evidence for his claim, saying on Twitter that the president “should provide more info to Congress immediately to assess constitutionality and legality.”     Messrs. Sasse, Graham and Amash have been among the Republicans most willing to publicly criticize Mr. Trump in the past. Still, few if any Republicans defended his comments Saturday.     Mr. Trump’s assertion followed several days of negative news coverage, as attention focused on interactions between Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers, family, and political allies with representatives of the Russian government. Saturday’s tweets marked a return to the caustic tone that has often characterized the president’s remarks, a tone he departed from during a well-received speech to a joint session of Congress earlier in the week.     Under the law, presidents can’t legally order wiretaps. In a national security probe, investigators seeking a wiretap must convince a judge there is probable cause that a target for surveillance is an agent of foreign intelligence, and that the main purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information. Investigators sometimes face a higher bar if the target is an American citizen.     In a criminal probe, investigators must show probable cause that a crime has been committed for electronic surveillance to be approved.     The conservative media outlet Breitbart, whose former chairman, Mr. Bannon, is Mr. Trump’s political strategist, published an article Friday based on the claims of a right-wing radio host that intelligence agencies were conducting a “silent coup” against Mr. Trump.     The host,         Mark Levin,    and the Breitbart article assert the Obama administration received authorization to conduct surveillance on the Trump campaign. Mr. Levin said that intelligence-gathering on the Trump campaign and its surrogates—rather than the communications between Mr. Trump’s allies and Russian officials—should be investigated by Congress.     Democrats reacted angrily to what they called baseless claims by Mr. Trump, including the president’s description of his predecessor as “bad” or “sick.”     “The President offered no evidence to support this spectacularly reckless allegation,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation’s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them.”     This isn’t the first time Mr. Trump has offered allegations of election-related misdeeds without evidence. He has also claimed that he lost the popular vote to Democrat         Hillary Clinton    because “millions” of votes were cast illegally in the 2016 presidential election, including those by illegal immigrants. There is no evidence for that, and election officials, including Republicans, say it didn’t happen.          Mr. Trump’s latest tweetstorm comes after a rough week for the administration, as positive reviews for his address to a joint session of Congress—in which the president avoided ad hominem attacks and some of his harshest rhetoric—faded in the face of revelations that Mr. Sessions hadn’t testified accurately about his communications with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing.     Mr. Sessions said Thursday that he would recuse himself from investigations involving the Trump campaign. He added that his testimony was an accurate reflection of his understanding of the question posed at his hearing, since he had no ongoing contact with any Russian officials.     The Wall Street Journal has reported that intelligence officials were examining contacts involving Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Mr. Sessions and others as part of a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation.     Mr. Sessions was on the president’s mind Saturday morning: The president’s first tweet, at 6:26 a.m., asserted that Mr. Sessions’ first meeting with Mr. Kislyak was part of an “education program” arranged by the Obama administration for a large group of ambassadors. Mr. Sessions has said that his contact with Mr. Kislyak was in the context of his position as a senator from Alabama, and not in his capacity as an adviser to the Trump campaign, but he acknowledged that the two discussed Ukraine.     In a later tweet, Mr. Trump said that the Russian ambassador had visited the Obama White House 22 times, and four times last year. That number of visits by the ambassador for a major foreign power wouldn't be unusual.     By 8:19 a.m., Mr. Trump had turned his sights to         Arnold Schwarzenegger,    the actor and former California governor who succeeded Mr. Trump as host of the reality TV show “The Apprentice,” and who has sparred with Mr. Trump over the president’s policies on immigration.     Mr. Schwarzenegger isn’t voluntarily leaving the show, but was fired for “his (bad) pathetic ratings,” Mr. Trump said.     “Sad end to great show,” the president wrote.
