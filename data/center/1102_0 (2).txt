WASHINGTON—A presidential task force has drafted recommendations that constitute a sweeping overhaul of the National Security Agency, according to people familiar with the recommendations.The panel's draft proposals would change the spy agency's leadership from military to civilian and limit how it gathers and holds the electronic information of Americans. The task force, for example, proposed that the records of nearly every U.S. phone call now collected in a controversial NSA program be held instead by the phone company or a third-party organization, these people said.      The panel also suggested the imposition of stricter standards before allowing NSA permission to search the data, these people said.                                                 Task force member Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Recommendations of the task force, which President Barack Obama established in August in response to disclosures from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, aren't binding and could change before the final draft is written. But the draft strongly challenges the U.S. intelligence establishment.               The group's report, which is due Sunday, hasn't yet been formally submitted to the White House, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. She declined to comment on it.      The report recently went through a declassification review, officials said, but the White House hasn't decided when it will make it public.           More           The White House has previously said it would consider the panel's recommendations in its own review of surveillance programs and policies, which is planned for completion by the end of the month.      Recommendations by the task force, called the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, are contained in a report hundreds of pages long and were described to The Wall Street Journal by four people familiar with them.      The group concluded that NSA surveillance programs follow the law but recommended dozens of changes to structure, transparency and internal security, these people said.     The proposal likely to gain the most attention would revamp the NSA phone records program, which surfaced in the leaks from Mr. Snowden, who is now a fugitive in Moscow. The panel's idea "aligns very closely" with a bill offered by House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) and Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), said one person familiar with the report, suggesting it could give ammunition to congressional efforts.     These lawmakers are in a heated political battle with their counterparts on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, who have proposed maintaining the NSA's phone-data program, but adding new oversight and reporting requirements.     The proposal to have that data held by a phone company or a third party would effectively end the controversial NSA practice known as bulk collection. NSA could collect data only after meeting a new higher standard of proof. NSA officials have said they are open to altering the program, but have warned broad changes would hamper the agency's speed and effectiveness because it would require separate searches of multiple databases.     At a Senate hearing Wednesday, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander said his agency's phone- records program was "a good model, not just for our country but for the rest of the world," because it had oversight from the executive branch, Congress and the courts.     "If we could come up with a better way, we ought to put it on the table and argue our way through it," he said. "The issue that I see right now is that there isn't a better way."     It isn't clear how the task force recommendation would affect other bulk-collection programs. For example, the Central Intelligence Agency uses the same legal authority to collect records on money transfers from companies like Western Union, the Journal reported last month.     Another task force recommendation would split the code-making component of NSA, known as the Information Assurance Directorate, from the rest of the agency. Currently, one part of NSA breaks electronic security codes while the other part of the agency develops and promotes them. Revelations from Mr. Snowden showed extensive NSA efforts to break different types of encryption and other security mechanisms.     The draft report embraces recent suggestions that a civilian lead the NSA and that the agency be separated from Cyber Command, the military's main cyberwarfare unit. When Cyber Command was launched in 2009, the Obama administration selected the director of NSA to also head the unit.     Civilian leadership of NSA has been promoted by a number of officials, including recently departed Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said the idea should be considered.     The task force also tackled the question of how to improve security clearances. The process, which is largely dependent on private contractors to issue security clearances, has come under intense criticism since revelations that Mr. Snowden received and maintained his security clearance despite red flags.     The group recommended that background checks be handled by a nonprofit organization. The company that conducted the background check for Mr. Snowden's clearance, US Investigations Services LLC, a Falls Church, Va., based firm, is the focus of a federal grand jury investigation over allegations of shoddy work. The company has denied wrongdoing.     Another draft proposal seeks to address European privacy concerns about NSA snooping by providing more safeguards for data of European citizens     Addressing broad criticism of the U.S. since the exposure of spy programs targeting foreign leaders, the group also proposed the development of international norms for government activity in cyberspace and the use of cyberweapons.      That idea has been promoted by the U.S. in international discussions on cybersecurity policy, but officials said they have had difficulty gaining acceptance from countries with active electronic spy programs, including China and Russia.     The members of the task force are Richard Clarke, a longtime U.S. counterterrorism chief; Michael Morell, former CIA deputy director; Geoffrey Stone, University of Chicago law professor; Cass Sunstein, former White House regulatory official; and Peter Swire, a former economic and privacy official.
