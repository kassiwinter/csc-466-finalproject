The central bank cited weakening exports and low inflation as reasons for the cut. "Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low," the central bank's monetary policy committee said in a statement. "Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."Wednesday's decision came a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York took the unusual step of injecting $53 billion into markets to quell a spike in interest rates.
