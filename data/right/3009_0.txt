      FILE: Aug. 15, 2012: President Obama speaks at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa. (AP)NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!  Florida voters are more afraid of President Obama's health care overhaul than Paul Ryan's budget plan when it comes to Medicare's future, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday.The poll of 500 likely Florida voters asked which plan "scares" them more.Forty-eight percent chose the health care law. Forty-one percent chose Ryan's plan - while 11 percent weren't sure.The results come as both campaigns elevate the issue of Medicare in their ads, interviews and stump speeches -- particularly in Florida, with its large senior population. Ryan is the author of the controversial budget plan that would, 10 years from now, give seniors the option of using a government payment to buy private insurance. Obama's campaign says the plan would "end Medicare as we know it."But Ryan and Mitt Romney are firing back, claiming that "ObamaCare" is the one that guts Medicare by "raiding" the entitlement to pay for the health care law. Ryan repeated that line in Ohio Thursday, saying "he raided $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. This will lead to fewer services for seniors."More On This... The Rasmussen poll results were within the margin of error. The poll from Aug. 15 had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.The poll also asked Floridians whether they prefer Obama or Romney. The results were roughly even, with 45 percent choosing Romney and 43 percent choosing Obama.
