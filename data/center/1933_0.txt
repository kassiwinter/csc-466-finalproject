Police in Washington, D.C., say two teenage girls have been arrested on charges of felony murder and armed carjacking for their alleged role in the death of Uber Eats driver Mohammad Anwar.According to CNN, the Metropolitan Police Department said the two girls, ages 13 and 15, used a taser on Anwar, 66, during a recent carjacking attempt on Tuesday. The attack, police said, prompted an accident that resulted in his death.Anwar, who lived in Springfield, Va., was described by his family in a GoFundMe as a “hard-working Pakistani immigrant who came to the United States to create a better life for him and his family.”“The details are still being investigated, however we know that Anwar was working on an UberEats delivery when two assailants attempted to carjack him in Navy Yard,” they said of his death.“Anwar was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and friend who always provided a smile when you needed one. He leaves behind a family, near and far, who cherish, love, and miss him dearly,” they continued. On the page, his family asked for donations to “provide a traditional Islamic funeral for him and assist his family with the loss of income,” calling him the “financial provider for his family.” The page has raised more than $383,000 in the past few days.In a statement to local media, a spokesperson for Uber said the company is “devastated by this tragic news and our hearts go out to Mohammad's family during this difficult time.”“We're grateful the suspects have been arrested and thank the Metropolitan Police Department for their diligence with this investigation,” they added.
