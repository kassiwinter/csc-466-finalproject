Texas health officials now say that as many as 100 people in the state are being monitored for possible signs of the Ebola virus. The people being monitored include the 12 to 18 people who first came into contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient listed in serious condition at a Dallas hospital. Federal health officials have said the figure includes a handful of schoolchildren and three members of the ambulance crew that took the infected man to the hospital. The larger number includes those initial people who had contact with Duncan. Four members of Duncanâ€™s family have been ordered to stay home until Oct. 19 without any unauthorized visitors. Officials say this is a precaution, even though they are not showing symptoms. On Thursday, it was reported that Duncan was seen vomiting on the ground outside the apartment complex where he was staying as he was being taken into an ambulance.Meanwhile, the AP reports that Liberian authorities said they plan to prosecute Duncan, a Liberian national, for allegedly lying on his airport health questionnaire. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Duncan did not have a fever when he boarded a flight to Dallas from Monrovia.Read it at The New York Times
