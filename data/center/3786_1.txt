When President Barack Obama emerged from his car in Charlottesville, Va., to address a crowd of 7,000 mostly college kids Wednesday afternoon, he asked longtime friend Valerie Jarrett: "Why am I having a short day?" Mr. Obama was unhappy there weren't more events for him to make his case for re-election. "There should be no short days," he said.

As Mr. Obama heads to the Democratic National Convention next week, the biggest change from his campaign four years ago is reflected in that complaint. The president is having to work more relentlessly to stay in the White House than he did to get there in the first place, and he knows it.     Mr. Obama arrives in Charlotte, N.C., with polls tightening and the economy far from recovery. When he accepts his party's nomination Thursday, Americans will see a charismatic figure much as they did four years ago, and one who, polls say, is more well-liked personally than is his GOP foe, Mitt Romney.               They will also see a more worried politician, who publicly insists he will win his re-election while privately he concedes he knows he could lose. His job-approval ratings have struggled to cross the magic 50% line. Advisers say he is keenly aware of the tough environment.     "He knows it's his last election," says Ms. Jarrett, who is one of his senior advisers. "He won't look back and think he could have done more."

Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, says the president faces a tougher election because of a shortage of bipartisan achievements, arguing Mr. Obama backed away from big potential budget and tax deals with Republicans. "He was deeply disappointing," Mr. McConnell said in an interview. "He was not the adult you would expect in the White House.…The president's campaign slogan is, 'It's not my fault.'"     Over his first term, Mr. Obama, 51 years old, has fundamentally shifted his view of modern presidential power, say those who know him well. He is now convinced the most essential part of his job, given politically divided Washington, is rallying public opinion to his side.     As a result, if he wins a second term, Mr. Obama plans to remain in campaign mode. "Barack is grayer, but he's wiser from the battles," says Charles Ogletree, a friend and one of Mr. Obama's professors at Harvard. "This time Barack will use the bully pulpit."     The White House declined a request to interview Mr. Obama.     The president views a second term in some ways as a second chance, an opportunity to approach the office differently, according to close aides. He would like to tackle issues such as climate change, immigration, education and filibuster reform.     He has told some aides that a sizable mistake at the start of his administration was his naiveté in thinking he could work with Republicans on weighty issues. "He's not cynical, because he still gets disappointed," one adviser says. "But he won't make that mistake again."     Still, even some people close to the president acknowledge he missed bridge-building opportunities, given his personal style and aversion to the traditional political niceties that can nurture relationships in D.C. circles.      Currently, Mr. Obama is spending the vast majority of his time on his campaign. He didn't watch Mr. Romney's Thursday speech at the GOP convention, aides say, though he read about it on his iPad. He worked on his own convention speech this week from Air Force One between calls to Gulf state governors about Hurricane Isaac.     And he is even embracing the little things about politics that previously would need coaxing. Early this year, for example, Mr. Obama started sending handwritten thank-you notes or placing phone calls to donors who hosted fundraisers for him, courtesies that advisers say he previously performed sporadically or delegated to aides. He is still headlining fundraisers but now without the grumbling that his aides have grown to expect.                                                 After years of clashes with the GOP and an economy that remains lukewarm, Barack Obama, shown on the South Lawn this week, is finding he must work more relentlessly to retain the White House than he did to get there originally.          AFP/Getty Images                                                                                                             Overall, Mr. Obama has out-raised Mr. Romney for the 2012 election cycle. However, in terms of cash on hand, Mr. Obama is entering a crucial stage of the race at a disadvantage. As of July 31, Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee had $185.9 million available to spend. Mr. Obama reported having a combined $126.9 million with the Democratic National Committee.     Mr. Obama must also grapple with diminished enthusiasm this time from voters who were critical to his 2008 victory. Fundraising suffered as some donors felt neglected during Mr. Obama's term or disliked policies such as financial regulatory overhaul.     The president's team is concerned about the lack of enthusiasm, particularly among young voters and Hispanics—both central to Mr. Obama's strategy. Mr. Obama is trying to energize the Democratic base with tough talk about Mr. Romney and the GOP. He recently launched an effort to rally college students in battleground states.     On Wednesday in Charlottesville, after addressing the crowd, mostly students from the University of Virginia, he went online to Reddit.com, a website popular among young people and the tech cognoscenti, and participated in an "Ask Me Anything" question-and-answer session.     "This is a different Barack Obama at this stage," one senior adviser says. "Last time, he thought Hillary Clinton had been his toughest opponent and that the heavy lifting was behind going into the general election." This time, he "understands that—whether Mitt Romney is the greatest candidate or not—the dynamics in this country make victory a harder prospect."     Mr. Obama arrived at the White House in January 2009 with strong Democratic majorities in the House and Senate and a cache of political capital based on his promise to be a consensus-builder. He netted several big legislative achievements, including an economic-stimulus package and overhauls of financial regulations and health care.                                                  Mr. Obama last year with John Boehner, Speaker of the House, amid 2011's partisan showdown over the federal debt limit.          AFP/Getty Images                                                                                                             But once in the White House, Mr. Obama struggled to find bipartisan consensus on the tough economic issues he inherited, and strained to maintain the connection he established with voters in 2008. He has had his share of legislative and national-security successes but also a host of battles and losses. In his passage of health-care overhaul, victory came after protracted, messy fights that went all the way to the Supreme Court, and closed-door dealings that hurt his standing with voters.     Republicans leveled the field in the 2010 midterm elections by taking a majority in the House and narrowing Democrats' majority in the Senate. It was clear Mr. Obama had lost some of his connection with voters.     By January 2011 Mr. Obama's advisers were holding focus groups twice a week, a former senior White House official said, and test-driving phrases and policies aimed at resonating with key voting groups.     Mr. Obama is particularly bothered that Republicans and some business leaders have painted him as antibusiness. He argues privately that he hasn't gotten proper appreciation for his work in pulling businesses, particularly the financial sector, out of the recession's ditch. "They say I don't get it, but I'm the one who saved it," Mr. Obama complained to a close ally after the 2010 midterm vote.     John Engler of the Business Roundtable, and former GOP governor of Michigan, said Mr. Obama's efforts to help business have been offset by some policies that have been harmful, citing parts of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul. He said senior administration officials have made substantial efforts to reach out to business in recent years, including a call to him this week about issues like export control. But, he said, "There's been some disconnect on the follow-through."     To underscore their contention that Mr. Obama doesn't understand the private sector, Republicans have seized on a remark the president made in July, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." Obama aides say the line has been taken out of context, as it was made after a reference to government investment in infrastructure such as roads and bridges.     The year 2011 was marked by months of Washington gridlock. Mr. Obama and Republican leaders found themselves repeatedly at odds, even as the president made strides on the national-security front, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.                                                 The president joined his family at a July basketball exhibition between the U.S. and Brazil before returning to the campaign trail.          EPA                                                                                                             After failing to achieve a sweeping bipartisan debt deal that summer—and then, watching as a smaller compromise struggled through the Republican House—Mr. Obama's new view of his campaign and presidency emerged, aides say: He decided to focus largely on re-election. David Axelrod, a longtime adviser, recalled Mr. Obama phoning him to say, "From here on out, I have to take my case to the American people."     In a sense, Mr. Obama is doubling down on his well-documented distaste for socializing with lawmakers and nurturing personal relationships with Washington insiders. Allies and foes alike say this tendency may have made his road tougher because he never established a rapport with Republican leaders.      Mr. Obama, for instance, rarely opens up his golf foursome to anyone outside his close friends and aides, and hasn't hosted members of Congress at Camp David. Both are tools that previous presidents used to mix business and pleasure. Mr. Obama, in contrast, prefers to spend social time with family and close friends.     His aides say that socializing with Republicans would have made no difference anyway, given their intent on unseating him. During his first year, Mr. Obama held occasional Wednesday-night receptions for members of Congress. "But he stopped those niceties because they didn't make a difference when Republicans' only goal was defeating him," an adviser says.      The extent to which he uses a strategy of generating voter support to pressure lawmakers to compromise on his agenda, aides say, depends on how much control Republicans retain in Congress.     But, aides also say, Mr. Obama has pledged to not again get bogged down in legislative sausage-making but to emphasize connecting with voters. Mr. Obama said in July that the mistake of his first years in office was his failure "to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times."     He added in a CBS interview: "So, getting out of this town, spending more time with the American people, listening to them and also then being in a conversation with them about where do we go together as a country—I need to do a better job of that in my second term."     Republicans scoff at that idea. They say Mr. Obama has it exactly backward and that he has done too little to work with them, and spent too much time playing politics. "He said his job is to tell a story to the American people, as if that's the whole problem here?" GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan said in a mocking tone in his Wednesday convention speech. "He needs to talk more, and we need to be better listeners?"     Mr. Obama has been changed by the presidency in other ways, friends and aides say. He has concluded that he was slow to understand or embrace the role of president as a kind of national counselor. His first test came on Christmas Day 2009. An airline passenger tried to blow up a plane heading to Detroit.      The nation was on edge. Mr. Obama, vacationing with his family in Hawaii, didn't address the country for days. His aides had advised him not to say anything publicly because the situation was unclear and no one was badly hurt, according to a senior administration official. Anything he said would just be words, they argued.      Mr. Obama agreed to the strategy, but, after taking a beating for it, was livid. He told his advisers, according to Mr. Axelrod, "It doesn't matter what I'm doing; people need to hear from the president."     The problem was driven home again during the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Obama was criticized for not quickly traveling to the scene to comfort residents and business owners whose lives were being upended.      Later that summer the president commissioned a memo from his communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, analyzing their efforts during that year. The conclusion, in part, was that the "no-drama" approach of Mr. Obama—and by extension his staff—caused his White House to underreact at some critical times.     More recently, aides think Mr. Obama met the moment after the January 2011 shooting in Tucson, Ariz., and that he has risen to the occasion during other tragedies, including the shooting this summer in Aurora, Colo.     Another change over the past four years is more personal. In some ways, being president actually has made it easier for Mr. Obama to be a hands-on dad. He spent much of his two daughters' early years in the Illinois state senate, the U.S. Senate or on the 2008 campaign trail. "For 12 years he was a legislator on the road," Mr. Axelrod says. "This is the first time he has really stable family time."     Aides say his daughters provide an escape from the presidential bubble. He coaches his daughter Sasha's basketball team, and attends older daughter Malia's concerts, sliding into the last row so as not to be a distraction to other parents, though the sharpshooters on the roof of the school are hard to miss. If he is in town, he is home for dinner in the White House residence nightly at 6:30, family time the first lady has strictly enforced.     Still, Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and close ally of the White House, said that Mr. Obama misses his old, quiet routines. Mr. Durbin recalled flying across Chicago with the president aboard Marine One a few months ago.      As the helicopter swooped along the Lake Michigan shoreline, Mr. Obama looked toward the Hyde Park neighborhood where he used to live, Mr. Durbin said. "I miss those people who were my friends even before I had any political title," the senator recalled Mr. Obama saying. "Just the idea of walking down the street to the bookstore or to a neighbor's house or to the barber shop is a piece of my life that I really miss."     What he has lost in anonymity, Mr. Obama has gained under the spotlight. He now calls George Clooney "a good friend." Mr. Obama is a bit of a stargazer particularly when it comes to NBA players. At an August fundraiser hosted by Michael Jordan and attended by Patrick Ewing, Carmelo Anthony and other standouts, he jawed with the players backstage, then reached for a metaphor to express a confidence that may have made for good trash-talking on the basketball court but caused some of his political aides to cringe.     "We are in the 4th quarter. We're up by a few points, but the other side is coming strong and they play a little dirty," Mr. Obama told donors. "We've got a few folks on our team in foul trouble. We've got a couple of injuries. And I believe that they've got one last run in them, and I'd say there's about seven minutes to go in the game."     At a different campaign stop in August in Iowa, another hoops moment presented itself. With reporters and cameras out of sight, Mr. Obama picked up a basketball lying on the court at the Heil Family Farm in Haverhill, where he criticized Mr. Romney on energy policy.     In a field surrounded by windmills, he shot from around the free-throw line—and missed. "I was too close" to the basket, he said to the farm owners and aides watching him. The president took a few steps back, to the three-point line, and shot again. This one went in. He turned to his small audience and smiled.     —Laura Meckler and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.     Write to         Carol E.
