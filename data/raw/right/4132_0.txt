                                                                                                                                         After two years under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, the good news was delivered to President Trump Sunday by his team of attorneys and staff at his private quarters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.                                                                                                                                                      No collusion with Russia, no charges of obstructing justice.                                                                                                                                                      “This is very good,” Mr. Trump said upon hearing the news.                                                                                                                                                                    The president and his advisers didn’t have access to the confidential Mueller report, instead reviewing Attorney General William P. Barr’s summary that was also transmitted to Congress.                                                                                                                              It said Mr. Mueller found no evidence of Trump campaign officials or other Americans conspiring with Russians to tamper with the 2016 presidential election.                                                                                                                                                                 And it said Mr. Barr and Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein concluded there wasn’t enough evidence of obstruction of justice to prosecute, after Mr. Mueller failed to reach a decision on that question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said late Sunday that the president is “feeling very good.”                                                                                                                              “He’s in a really good mood,” Mr. Gidley told reporters after Mr. Trump and his team returned to Washington on Air Force One. “He’s just very happy with how it all turned out.”                                                                                                                              The president watched TV on the flight from Florida, talked to staff including Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in his office on the plane, and made phone calls, apparently sharing the good news.                                                                                                                   “Donald Trump has been put in this horrible position for the last three years,” Mr. Gidley said.                                                                                                                 Asked about Mr. Mueller’s statement that the report doesn’t exonerate the president of possible obstruction, Mr. Gidley said, “Prosecutors don’t exonerate, they prosecute. They don’t prove a negative. That’s just silly.”                      “While it’s an exoneration for the president and definitely a great day for the administration, it’s also a great day for the American people,” he said. “Their vote for Donald Trump was vindicated.”                      Asked if the president supports making the report public, Mr. Gidley said, “We haven’t discussed that.”                      As he arrived back at the White House Sunday night on Marine One, the president stopped to speak to a cluster of reporters near the helicopter landing zone on the South Lawn.                      “I just want to tell you, America is the greatest place on Earth,” Mr. Trump said. “The greatest place on Earth.”                      With that, Mr. Trump entered the White House residence, seemingly with a new lease.
