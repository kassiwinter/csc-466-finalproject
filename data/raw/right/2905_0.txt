           	The Associated Press      The White House‚Äôs new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, Tweeted on Wednesday evening that he believes the leak of his financial disclosure form is a ‚Äúfelony‚Äù and that he will be contacting the FBI and Justice Department seeking an investigation.
In the Tweet, Scaramucci tagged White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and included a hashtag: ‚Äú#swamp.‚Äù UPDATE: Scaramucci has since deleted this tweet and sent another, saying that it is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to interpret his first message the way Axios did, writing, ‚ÄúScaramucci appears to want Priebus investigated by FBI.‚Äù
Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45 pic.twitter.com/AB0reseuX1

Politico‚Äôs Lorraine Woellert¬†wrote late Wednesday:
The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics.The disclosure form hasn‚Äôt been previously reported.
According to the Politico report‚Äîwhich Josh Dawsey of Politico‚Äôs White House team contributed to‚ÄîScaramucci also has a number of high-worth assets. Woellert goes on:
In his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island. A minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast. Scaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA. As a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure. He has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million.
Scaramucci‚Äôs decision to tag Priebus in the Tweet has set off a firestorm on Twitter and among some members of the media.

Tensions between Scaramucci and Priebus are raw as ever, I‚Äôm told tonight. There‚Äôs a reason Mooch tagged Reince on FBI leak tweet.

A White House spokeswoman, Lindsey Walters, has not responded to a request for comment from Priebus via text message from Breitbart News late Wednesday evening.
Scaramucci‚Äôs hiring by the president as the communications director‚Äîa decision the president made without informing Priebus until after it was made‚Äîwas seen as a blow to Priebus‚Äôs standing in the West Wing. What‚Äôs more, the president and Scaramucci have both made clear that Scaramucci reports directly to the president‚Äînot to Priebus, the chief of staff. Reportedly, Priebus vehemently opposed Scaramucci‚Äôs hiring in the West Wing.
Scaramucci has made clear he intends to root out leakers in the White House. He has already terminated one suspected leaker, a White House press aide named Michael Short. Short denies leaking, but news broke earlier this week that Short was being terminated. After Short originally denied the reports on-the-record, it came out that his termination was being processed by the White House counsel‚Äôs office. At that point, to avoid being terminated, Short resigned.
Short was not the only suspected leaker and Priebus ally who has lost a job this year. Deputy White House chief of staff Katie Walsh‚ÄîPriebus‚Äôs old chief of staff from his RNC days‚Äîwas terminated earlier this year after reports surfaced that she was a leaker.
UPDATE 1:14 A.M.
Scaramucci deleted his original Tweet early Thursday, and replaced it with this one:
