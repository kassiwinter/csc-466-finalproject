Jay Nixon directed the Missouri National Guard to leave four days after he deployed them to help police the city during protest marches that had turned into violent clashes with police, including the use of police tear gas and rubber bullets amid vandalism and looting. Few guard troops actually were seen on Ferguson's streets as they were largely confined to a nearby mall that houses a security command center.

Nixon said in a statement.     After more than a week of clashes between protesters and police, Wednesday night was more relaxed and mostly quiet, officials said. Protests have been spurred by the Aug. 9 killing of 18-year-old         Michael Brown    by a police officer.                Attorney General          Eric Holder's    visit and the beginning of a local grand jury investigation, both Wednesday, have appeared to help calm residents who flocked to this city's West Florissant Avenue for protests, which were often followed by late-night clashes with police.     —Devlin Barrett contributed to this article.
