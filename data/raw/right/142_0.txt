                 | August 31, 2019 05:46 PM                 Seven people were killed and at least 19 injured during shootings in and around the cities of Odessa and Midland, Texas, Saturday.       A gunman, identified as a white male in his mid-30s, was shot and killed by police in Odessa.                   Police originally believed two suspects were at large, with one driving a hijacked mail truck and "shooting at random people," while the other was thought to be driving a "gold/white small Toyota truck." However, police now believe there was only one gunman in a gold Honda who at one point ditched the vehicle and took U.S. Postal Vehicle to a local theater where a shootout with police ensued.       Odessa Police Chief Mike Gerke said during a press conference that police believe they "have the threat contained" but urged residents to remain alert and cautious. He also said that he has "an idea" of who the shooter is but was not prepared to share that information. Gerke added three of those injured were law enforcement officers.             The shootings reportedly began in the late afternoon when a state patrol officer pulled over the suspect's gold Honda on a highway that connects Odessa and Midland. During the attempted traffic stop, the suspect shot the trooper and fled to Odessa where he continued firing shots until police apprehended him.             President Trump has been briefed on the situation, and the White House is monitoring it.                       Just briefed by Attorney General Barr about the shootings in Texas. FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged. More to follow.â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019                              Texas Gov.
