NBC's "Today" show is bringing Sarah Palin on board as a co-host  for one morning, this Tuesday, April 3. The announcement was posted Sunday, April 1, on NBC's website. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)The news that Sarah Palin will no longer be a paid contributor to Fox News puts an exclamation point on the end of an era, or at least a chapter, in U.S. political history.
