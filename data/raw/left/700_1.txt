"At this point, not nationwide, but ... we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We'll be looking at that," Trump said during a White House press briefing. But the President added that no decisions had been taken regarding a national curfew. "We haven't really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won't have to," he said. "That's a very big step.""It's a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it," he added. The comments come amid active discussions within the Trump administration to encourage a possible "curfew" across the nation in which non-essential businesses would be encouraged to close by a certain time each night in response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to an administration official and another source familiar with the matter.The recommendation would likely focus on malls, restaurants and bars, while grocery stores and pharmacies could be exempt from the curfew. The idea would be fashioned after the European model but would likely have to be enforced at a local level.The source familiar told CNN that a curfew could be strongly encouraged at the state level.Vice President Mike Pence's spokeswoman Katie Miller strongly disputed that a curfew was under consideration."A curfew is not on the table," she said Monday morning.Miller said curfews would not be part of the guidelines presented by the task force during President Donald Trump's video teleconference with governors that took place later Monday morning. On the call, Trump urged governors to try to secure additional medical equipment on their own without waiting for the federal government to intervene, though he did say they would try to help. "We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves," Trump said on the call, according to a person familiar. He was discussing what health experts say is a serious need for more respirators and ventilators to deal with the influx of coronavirus patients.The possibility of nationwide curfews comes as many cities and states have already taken aggressive steps toward curbing social gatherings as the coronavirus outbreak progresses in the United States.
