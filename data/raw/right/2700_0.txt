                                                                                                                                         Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Tuesday he doesn’t believe the projections from the Congressional Budget Office on House Republicans’ bill to repeal parts of Obamacare are correct.                                                                                                                                                      “I don’t believe the facts are correct,” Mr. Mulvaney said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”                                                                                                                                                      “I’m not just saying that because it looks bad for my political position. I’m saying that based upon a track record of the CBO being wrong before, and we believe the CBO is wrong now,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                    He said the CBO assumes, for example, that as soon as the individual mandate in Obamacare is gone, someone would go off of Medicaid.                                                                                                                              “Look, the CBO — really good at counting numbers. Maybe not that good at making decisions about coverage,” Mr. Mulvaney said.                                                                                                                                                                 The CBO projected on Monday that the Republican health care plan would reduce the federal deficit by more than $300 billion over the course of a decade, but that it would also result in 24 million fewer people having health insurance, including 14 million fewer in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Overall, Congress’s official budget score-keeper projected that 52 million people would be uninsured by the end of the time period, compared to 28 million otherwise.
