Saudi Arabia, under mounting pressure, weighed a new public response to confront accusations its agents killed a dissident Saudi journalist, as President         Trump    dispatched his top diplomat to the kingdom and investigators searched the presumed crime scene in Istanbul for clues.On Monday, Saudi officials were considering whether to say rogue operatives killed Jamal Khashoggi during an interrogation gone wrong, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could help the royal family distance itself from responsibility. The case has strained U.S.-Saudi ties and cast a shadow over Crown Prince         Mohammed bin Salman’s    efforts to overhaul the kingdom’s economy and attract foreign investment. Since Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, powerful U.S. executives have withdrawn from a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh this month.     The government’s tentative explanation comports with comments Mr. Trump made Monday, after speaking to Saudi King Salman: “It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,” the president said.          It is unclear whether a Saudi statement would be released, and its content hasn’t been completed, the people familiar with the matter said. The Saudi government didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump said, “so far it’s just the rumor of a report coming out.”     Newsletter Sign-up The 10-Point.

Turkish authorities allege that Mr. Khashoggi, a former royal insider, was killed by Saudi agents after he entered the country’s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Turkish government has shared with U.S. officials what it describes as audio and video recordings purporting to show that Mr. Khashoggi was killed in the building, people familiar with the matter said.     Saudi Arabia has denied the accusation and said Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate alive, soon after arriving.     Mr. Trump said he had a 20-minute phone call early Monday with King Salman, who “firmly denied any knowledge” of what happened to the missing journalist. The president suggested Saudi agents could have been operating without the Saudi government’s knowledge. He dispatched Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo    to Saudi Arabia to meet the king and visit “other places if necessary,” including Turkey.     Mr. Trump’s comments, coupled with Mr. Pompeo’s trip to Saudi Arabia and a joint Saudi-Turkish investigation, were widely seen as an indication of a possible deal among U.S., Saudi Arabia and Turkey to prevent further diplomatic damage.     “It looks like some sort of middle ground agreement will be reached,” said Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, a Washington-based think tank often critical of the Saudi monarchy. “The Saudis will blame their people for taking unauthorized action and promise to put them through their justice system.”                                                  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is being sent by President Trump on a visit to Saudi Arabia.

Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey have sent signals they were seeking to avoid direct confrontation over an incident that has drawn widespread international concern and congressional pressure on the White House.     Mr. Trump also said King Salman had assured him that Saudi Arabia and Turkey were “working hand in hand, very closely on getting to the bottom of what happened.”     Mr. Trump has cited denials by associates and allies, at times in the face of evidence to the contrary. He repeatedly has noted Russian President      Vladimir Putin’s        denials of U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusions that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. When Republican Senate candidate         Roy Moore    was accused last fall of molesting and assaulting teenage girls, Mr. Trump said of the allegation: “He totally denies it.”      The 82-year-old King Salman is the ruler of Saudi Arabia. But his son, Prince Mohammed, is effectively the country’s day-to-day leader, and has overseen a succession of recent campaigns targeting perceived dissidents at home and abroad.     Suspicion that Saudi Arabia played a role in the journalist’s disappearance has led a growing list of Western executives and advisers to announce they were pulling out of a premier three-day conference set to start in Riyadh on Oct. 23.     Among them were         James Dimon,    the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a featured speaker whose bank has longstanding ties to Saudi Arabia;         Laurence Fink,    CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc.; and         Stephen Schwarzman,    CEO of private-equity giant Blackstone Group, said people familiar with the matter.     Mr. Trump said the administration had not yet made a decision on whether Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    would attend.     The Saudi embassy in Washington told invitees on Monday that it was canceling its annual “national day” commemoration, a reception held to hone relations with leaders in the U.S. capital.

BGR Government Affairs, a lobbying firm, also ended its $80,000-a-month work with the embassy, an official said.     Meanwhile, King Salman ordered the Saudi public prosecutor to head a probe to determine responsibility for who was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, people familiar with the matter said Monday. Probe results could be announced within days, and lead to some Saudi individuals being held accountable for Mr. Khashoggi’s death, one of the people said.     Meantime, Turkish authorities said they had reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia to search the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul for the missing journalist. Turkish television showed a group of investigators entering the building at 7:30 p.m. local time, saying the inspection would drag out late into the night.     Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said police had gathered evidence that Mr. Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered by a team of 15 operatives dispatched from Riyadh. But Turkish President         Recep Tayyip Erdogan    has stopped short of accusing the kingdom of his murder.     Turkish authorities suspect Prince Mohammed had a hand in Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance because the alleged team of operatives they say killed the journalist comprised Saudi government officials and intelligence officers who flew to Istanbul on corporate jets controlled by the crown prince.                                         Turkish officials say a team of alleged Saudi assassins apprehended and likely killed a Saudi journalist in Istanbul. The Saudis have denied any involvement but Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate on Oct.2.

Since then, however, Saudi and Turkish officials argued over how thoroughly Turkish investigators would be allowed to inspect the diplomatic compound.     “We wanted to come in with all the chemicals and equipment investigators use to inspect crime scenes,” the official said. “The Saudis said we could only get a brief tour.”     The official said he expected Monday’s search would be conducted on Turkey’s terms and amount to a full inspection.     It comes a day after Mr. Erdogan spoke about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance with King Salman. The phone call, during which King Salman thanked the Turkish president for agreeing to set up a joint Saudi-Turkish team to investigate what happened, was the first direct contact between the two leaders since the journalist went missing.     --Margherita Stancati, Farnaz Fassihi, Courtney McBride and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.
