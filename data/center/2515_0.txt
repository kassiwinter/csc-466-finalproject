A State Department official in 2015 tried to keep the Federal Bureau of Investigation from marking a         Hillary Clinton    email as classified, according to documents that reveal the extent to which officials sought to reduce the number of messages judged to contain national secrets.The move by the State Department, which came after questions were raised about Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, focused on a single email about the probe into the 2012 attacks on U.S. outposts in Benghazi, Libya. The newly released summaries of FBI interviews show one State official pressed the FBI not to mark one message classified, and that senior State officials exerted similar pressure within their own agency as it studied the Clinton emails. Each email judged to be classified, even more than two years after Mrs. Clinton left the State Department, represented another potential mark against not just the State Department, but also Mrs. Clinton’s claims she did nothing wrong and didn’t compromise national secrets.      The FBI announced in July, after an investigation, that while it had found “extremely careless” conduct in Mrs. Clinton’s email use, evidence didn’t merit filing criminal charges.        
More on Election 2016        Mrs. Clinton, now the Democratic presidential nominee, has said her use of a private server was a mistake, and her aides have argued the email scandal was fueled by government officials aggressively overclassifying documents retroactively. Some Republicans have called for her to be further investigated.               Other emails, hacked by the WikiLeaks organization and involving Clinton campaign officials, continue to be released daily. A new batch Monday showed top advisers speculating about whether Vice President      Joe Biden        would launch a White House bid and mulling questions about how to address Mrs. Clinton’s weaknesses as a candidate.     The FBI began reviewing Mrs. Clinton’s State Department emails for possible classified material in 2015, after an inspector general raised concerns about her use of a private server to conduct government business. She left the agency in early 2013.     According to the newly released documents, Patrick Kennedy, a senior official at the State Department, repeatedly reached out to senior FBI officials seeking to get them to reverse their opinion that an email about the Benghazi attacks, which had no classification markings on it, should be classified.     FBI officials weren’t convinced the email should be unclassified, according to the written summaries of interviews. One official’s account said Mr. Kennedy suggested that in exchange for marking the email unclassified, “State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden,” according to a summary of the FBI interview of the unidentified witness.     Another FBI employee recounted it differently, saying a senior agency official suggested to Mr. Kennedy that he would look into the email matter if the State official “would provide authority concerning the FBI’s request to increase its personnel in Iraq.” That suggestion was ultimately rejected by others at the FBI, according to officials and the documents.     In one subsequent discussion with FBI officials, Mr. Kennedy spent 15 minutes “debating the classification of the email and attempting to influence the FBI to change its markings,” according to a summary of the FBI interview of the unidentified witness.     Mr. Kennedy was working under Mrs. Clinton’s successor, current Secretary         John Kerry,    at the time.     A State Department spokeswoman said Mr. Kennedy “sought to understand the FBI’s process for withholding certain information from public release.…Classification is an art, not a science, and individuals with classification authority sometimes have different views.”     Senior congressional Republicans said Mr. Kennedy should be removed from his job because of the quid pro quo discussions. State Department spokesman Mark Toner dismissed those calls, saying, “There is no quid pro quo.”     House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said the new disclosure “bears all the signs of a coverup,” and he renewed his call for intelligence officials to deny Mrs. Clinton further access to classified information.     Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Monday: “It’s very well known there were disputes between State and other agencies about classification,” and said it was “not uncommon for officials to fight over classification.” He also noted that the dispute “took place entirely within the government.”     The issue over the classifications came to a head in a conference call between Mr. Kennedy and Michael Steinbach, then an FBI assistant director. “Kennedy continued to pressure the FBI to change the classified markings on the email to unclassified. Steinbach refused to do so,” the FBI summary states.     The FBI official told investigators that “State has an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the Clinton emails in order to protect State interests and those of Clinton.”     It wasn’t just FBI officials who raised such concerns. Within the State Department, an unidentified employee told a similar story about how employees felt pressured to not mark as classified Mrs. Clinton’s emails related to the Benghazi attacks, according to the newly released documents.     That person said their office “felt immense pressure to complete the review quickly and to not label anything as classified,” according to the FBI summary of the interview.     Within the State Department, there were repeated disagreements about which messages, if any, should be marked classified, this person told the FBI. Within the office reviewing the documents, employees “felt intimidated when they used or suggested the use of [a national security exemption] on any of the 296 emails,” the interview summary said. Declaring such an exemption would have meant Mrs. Clinton’s emails contained at least some classified information.      The latest WikiLeaks emails, apparently obtained from         John Podesta’s    account, show the Clinton campaign chairman incorrectly predicting in September 2015 that Mr. Biden “will get in.” But, he adds, “we are still way more likely than not to win nomination.”     Another Podesta email from September 2015 shows him telling Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton confidante, that the campaign had “taken on a lot of water that won’t be easy to pump out of the boat.” He added, “Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts.”     Clinton campaign officials haven’t confirmed the authenticity of the stolen emails. U.S. officials believe hackers tied to Russian intelligence broke into Mr. Podesta’s email account.     —Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.
