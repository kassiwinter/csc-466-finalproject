States across the country are grappling with how to hold their presidential nominating contests while keeping voters and poll workers shielded from the coronavirus.Georgia on Saturday postponed its March 24 primary until May 19 and paused in-person early voting, which had already begun. Louisiana said Friday it was postponing its April 4 primary, pushing it into June, and later-voting states such as Maryland and Pennsylvania are trying to figure out how to safely hold primaries as events across the U.S. are being rapidly canceled to limit the virus’s spread.        
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSWhat impact do you think the virus will have on voting this spring? Join the conversation below.        Four states with primaries Tuesday—Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois—assured voters they can safely turn out. They called for healthy poll workers to show up and provided guidance on keeping voting equipment clean, the chief election officials from the four states said in a joint statement Friday.               “Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,” the officials said.     The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged states to encourage early and mail-in voting when possible, or to encourage voters to come during off-peak times. The CDC also recommended cleaning and routinely disinfecting voting equipment, such as electronic voting machines.     The virus will pose a series of hurdles for voters, said Charles Stewart, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who studies election administration.                                         There’s no standardized voting method in the U.S., which can lead to uncertainty when things go wrong. But some experts say the patchwork of systems may help keep elections safe. WSJ’s Lorie Hirose explains.                                                                                                     “What we hope for is that we can respond to the voting challenges in a nonpartisan way, in an era in which any change to how we vote is usually framed in a very partisan manner,” Mr. Stewart said, adding that the response so far has been balanced.     In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, the Elections Department is providing hand sanitizer at all early voting and Election Day locations, said         Suzy Trutie,    deputy elections supervisor. Additionally, there are bathrooms with access to soap and water at polling places, and there will also be disinfectant spray and wipes at all polling places, she said.     Florida state records show that about 860,000 people have already cast ballots in the Democratic primary. That amounts to about half of the total vote in the last two competitive presidential primaries, in 2016 and 2008.

There will also be more breaks for poll workers to wash their hands.     The unintended result of too much cleaning was on display in some New Hampshire towns that held March 10 elections. Some paper ballots jammed in scanning machines after coming into contact with freshly sanitized surfaces.     This happened twice in Atkinson, N.H., said Julianna Hale, town clerk. One woman with a wet ballot acknowledged she precleaned the desk where she voted.     “She said, ‘Absolutely, are you kidding? I was packing my own wipes!’” Ms. Hale said.      Ms. Hale stressed the machines performed well overall, and the vendor was on the scene quickly to clear jams.     Roughly 80% of coronavirus cases tend to be mild or moderate. But those who are older or have underlying health conditions are at a higher risk.        
More on the Coronavirus        The elderly population’s vulnerability presents a particular challenge, since volunteer poll workers tend to be older—most are at least 61, a government survey of the 2018 midterm elections showed. Several states have had volunteers drop out recently, and some officials are trying to recruit younger people to fill in.     Over 1,370 Ohioans have volunteered to be poll workers since Tuesday through the state election website, Jon Keeling, spokesman for the Ohio secretary of state, said midday Friday.     More than 140 polling locations in Ohio will be relocated to avoid senior living centers or other sensitive sites, Mr. Keeling said. Officials in Illinois said they are also handling numerous polling place changes, including nursing homes that have pulled out of being sites.     In Tazewell County, Ill., John Ackerman, the county clerk, said his office received “greatly more than double” the usual number of mail-ballot requests in recent weeks. At least two-dozen poll workers have dropped out suddenly, he said.     “We’re just having to use less,” he said. “It’s already hard to get election judges as it is. We just don’t have the time to find replacements.”     Voting-rights advocates warned that officials will need to put in extra effort to communicate the location changes to voters on such short notice. “This is a major issue,” said         Kristen Clarke,    president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “We should anticipate confusion.”     Looking ahead, more than 20 other U.S. states and territories also have coming primaries, and many are cobbling together options. In Wisconsin, which has an April 7 primary, officials ordered that absentee ballots be mailed directly to residents in nursing homes and care facilities, avoiding the usual system of sending special workers to assist in-person.
