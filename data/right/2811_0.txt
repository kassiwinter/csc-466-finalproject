           President Donald Trump hurled more jabs at the "fake news media" Sunday morning, describing White House "leaks" as "fabricated lies" and saying stories with "sources say" make it "very possible" those "sources don't exist" and are made up by "fake news writers." Trump included all of this in a morning tweetstorm.
President Trump then piled on the media bias in the coverage of this week's Montana congressional race, saying it was treated as "a big deal" by Democrats and "fake news" media "until the Republican won." Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered

Some of the tweets were deleted and reposted minutes later to fix spelling errors. It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names....

....it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 Trump's Sunday morning tweeting, which has become a staple of his presidency, started with more cheery messages, hailing the Republicans' "big win" in Montana and the "great success" of his European and Middle East trip he has just returned from. 
Big win in Montana for Republicans!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 
Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 Trump returned late Saturday from his first international trip as US president, geared up to combat concerns over aides' ties to Russia including explosive reports that his son-in-law Jared Kushner sought a secret communications line with Moscow.
The latest furor was stirred up after The Washington Post reported late Friday that Kushner -- arguably Trump's closest White House aide, and husband of the president's eldest daughter Ivanka -- made a pre-inauguration proposal to the Russian ambassador to set up a secret, bug-proof link with the Kremlin.
Specifically, the FBI is looking at meetings that Kushner fielded with Kislyak and Russian banking executive Sergey Gorkov in December. This is part of a probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
Reports have also surfaced recently that Trump shared classified intelligence with Russian officials and asked former FBI Director James Comey to end a federal investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
