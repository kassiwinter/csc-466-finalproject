WASHINGTON—International support for the U.S.-led military campaign against Islamic State gathered strength with the U.K. vowing to destroy the group after it killed a British aid worker, Arab states agreeing to participate in airstrikes and Australia pledging forces.British Prime Minister         David Cameron    said Sunday his country will do whatever is needed to combat the threat posed by the extremist group operating in Iraq and Syria, reacting to a video released on Saturday that showed the beheading of Briton         David Haines.                                             A conference to discuss how to combat the Islamic State is under way in Paris. Made up of 26 countries, including the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Russia, it aims to show a united front on fighting the militant group. WSJ's Mark Kelly reports                                                                                                     Leading Middle East countries are prepared to join the U.S. in conducting airstrikes on militant targets in Iraq and Syria, according to senior U.S. and Arab officials.      Though pledges of support are rolling in, the plan of action is still short on specifics, particularly on the next steps and the scale of military forces that various countries will commit. Islamic State, in the meantime, continues to hold vast tracts of land in Syria and Iraq and has built up a formidable financing structure that includes control of oil resources.           
Related           "I can tell you right here and now, that we have countries in this region, countries outside of this region, in addition to the United States, all of whom are prepared to engage in military assistance in actual strikes if that is what it requires," Secretary of State         John Kerry    told CBS's "Face the Nation," from a stop in Cairo, Egypt, over the weekend.               "There are some that are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and do airstrikes if that's what they're called on to do," he added.     The Obama administration's plans to eradicate the Islamic State are contingent upon Iraqi troops and Syrian rebels effectively using airstrikes to push back the terrorist organization from the territories it has captured, according to U.S. and Arab officials. They also depend on regional governments cutting off the flow of funding and foreign fighters coming into the Islamic State's war machine. Neither is certain.     In addition to the training of the moderate Syrian rebels, the Obama administration and Iraq's new government agreed last week to establish a new Iraqi National Guard to press the fight. The unit will be made up of the largely Sunni populations living in contested areas and would be integrated into the regular Iraqi military. This new force is seen as being more committed to protecting Iraqi territory than Shiite fighters deployed from Baghdad.     Still, critics of the administration's strategy said they were skeptical the training could be completed quickly enough to affect the situation on the ground and that they believed more U.S. military personnel will eventually be required.     "It is my estimation, that after all the dust settles…I'm betting we're up to around 5,000 [soldiers] by the end of the year" in Iraq, Gen.         Michael Hayden,    a former CIA director, said on "Fox News Sunday."     Also, concerns remain about just how far the Mideast states will go to choke off Islamic State's finances and fighters. U.S. and Arab officials have voiced particular fears about the role of Turkey, which they said has been the primary conduit for money and militants joining Islamic State. Turkish officials have voiced concerns about a backlash if they aggressively move against the terrorist organization.     Turkish officials have said in recent days that they have moved to aggressively police the flow of foreign fighters, deporting or denying entry to thousands.     The British prime minister is looking into a range of options for increased involvement in the fight against the militants, including possible participation in airstrikes on targets in Iraq, according to an official in Mr. Cameron's office. But he didn't outline any immediate shift in British military strategy on Sunday. Currently, the British military is contributing in several support roles to the American air operations against Islamic State. British air assets are providing intelligence gathering and transporting weapons to the Kurdish regional forces and humanitarian aid to Iraqis.     The Australian prime minister said Sunday he was committing 600 Australian military personnel—400 from the Royal Australian Air Force and 200 from the army, including special forces troops—to operations.     Arab states also have increasingly committed in the past week to support the U.S. efforts by providing training to Syrian rebels and Iraqi forces, allowing basing and overflight rights for American aircraft, and helping to ship arms and supplies to the Kurdish and other Iraqi forces.     A senior Arab official involved in the deliberations on the emerging U.S.-led coalition confirmed Mr. Kerry's assessments.      "I think you have most of the Arab countries on board. Now it's the question of what exactly does it mean to be on board," the official said. "Everyone is motivated."     Neither U.S. nor Arab officials on Sunday named specifically which Mideast governments might join the U.S. in airstrikes. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar are all seen as having the military capabilities to support the U.S. campaign.     The U.A.E. and Qatar took part in North Atlantic Treaty Organization airstrikes on Libya in 2011 that helped overthrow Col. Moammar Gadhafi.      "It would only be natural for all countries to calibrate…what support they're willing to provide to the particular circumstances, locations and other aspects," a senior State Department official said Sunday.     Mr. Kerry is finishing up a week of diplomacy in the Mideast and Europe aimed at galvanizing the U.S.'s allies in the fight against Islamic State.     The Obama administration's top diplomat will attend an international conference in Paris on Monday that seeks to generate financial, diplomatic and security support for Iraq's new government led by Prime Minister         Haider al-Abadi.         Mr. Kerry's mission, which has included stops in Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt, exposed some deep divisions among the U.S.'s Mideast allies over how to confront the Islamic State threat and highlighted the difficulties of concluding the mission, according to U.S. and Arab officials.     Turkey, which is a NATO member, has ruled out taking part in military operations and said it won't allow Washington to use U.S. fighter planes based in Incirlik, Turkey, to conduct strikes on Iraq and Syria.     U.S. and Arab officials also have voiced continued concerns about Qatar's potential role in the coalition because of what they describe as the arms and money the Persian Gulf state has provided to al Qaeda-linked militants fighting the Assad regime in Syria in recent years. Qatar's government denies funding any extremist groups.     U.S. and Arab officials said the growing strength of Islamic State has alarmed the region's leading Sunni states because of the threat the terrorist organization poses to their own leadership.     Saudi Arabia has agreed to host a training facility for up to 10,000 Syrian rebels who are fighting both Islamic State and Syrian President         Bashar al-Assad's    regime, according to U.S. and Arab officials.      Mr. Kerry also discussed with Egyptian leaders on Saturday Cairo's possible role in training Iraqi forces in counterterrorism tactics.     "I would suspect that they would invite the Iraqis to start to participate in that," said a second State Department official who is traveling with Mr. Kerry.     U.S. officials said Arab countries like Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain also have already aided the Pentagon significantly in conducting airstrikes and humanitarian drops in northern Iraq over the past month.     The possibility of the U.S. coordinating its campaign against Islamic State with two of its traditional Mideast adversaries, Iran and Syria, faded in recent days.     French officials had raised the possibility that Iranian diplomats would be invited to the Paris conference on Iraq in light of Tehran's extensive role in providing military and intelligence support to the Baghdad government for its fight against the terrorist organization. But Mr. Kerry on Friday ruled out such an invitation, citing Tehran's backing of terrorist groups operating in Iraq and Syria.     Mr. Kerry also debunked the possibility of the U.S. cooperating with Mr. Assad in fighting Islamic State, despite the recent overtures to Washington by the Damascus government.     "We're not going to coordinate it with Syria," the U.S. diplomat said in his CBS News interview, which aired on Sunday.     —Margaret Coker and Cassell Bryan-Low contributed to this article.
