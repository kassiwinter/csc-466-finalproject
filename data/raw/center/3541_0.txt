But the vote margin, with more senators supporting it than the amount needed to override a veto, underscores the depth of concern on Capitol Hill.“I think it’s significant that, as many of us have discussed with the president and his Cabinet, that there’s some anxiety about ... tariffs,” Senate Majority Whip John CornynJohn CornynDemocrats show little appetite for Biden's call for gun control Poll finds Abbott with 10-point lead on Beto O'Rourke in Texas Photos of the Week: Marking COVID-19 deaths, Mt.

We will continue to push for a binding vote and are hopeful one will be scheduled in the near future," Corker said in a statement. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) — who was opposing Trump's appeals court judges over the tariff fight — added that Congress has "to rein in abuse of presidential authority and restore Congress’ constitutional authority in this regard.”Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin HatchOrrin Grant HatchMeet Washington's most ineffective senator: Joe Manchin Lobbying world Congress, stop holding 'Dreamers' hostage MORE (R-Utah) has said he will bring up tariff legislation in the committee. Some GOP senators on the panel have voiced support for narrowing Section 232 of the trade law.Trump allies have warned lawmakers from passing legislation, arguing it would undercut the president’s negotiating ability.Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) knocked senators shortly before the vote, saying they were tying Trump’s hands.“I just don’t understand why this body continues to try to tie the hands of this president at every turn," he said. "This president is committed to creating a more level playing field for our workers and our companies here at home to compete.” Perdue was one of 11 Republican senators who voted no.
