The announcement came on the day of his funeral in his hometown of Houston, where the school is located.TSU said on Facebook that the gesture is a way it "honors the memory of George Floyd on the day that he is laid to eternal rest." "Mr. Floyd was a lifelong citizen of the Third Ward and a revered graduate of Jack Yates High School. The Board, in conjunction with the TSU Foundation Board, has approved a fund to provide a full scholarship for Floyd's beloved daughter, Gianna," the school said in the Facebook post. TSU will "prepare a place" for Gianna "if she wishes to attend the University," TSU said.                                         11:30 PM / June 9, 2020       Police fired 41 shots when they killed Amadou Diallo.

Kadiatou Diallo was pained when she heard about the death of black Minneapolis resident George Floyd after he was arrested by four police officers. It was a difficult reminder of two decades earlier, when four white officers opened fire on her son, Amadou Diallo, killing him outside of his apartment building. "As the mother of Amadou Diallo, having to suffer my loss on February 4, 1999, my wound was open again," she told "CBS This Morning" co-host Gayle King.

But the sobering list is so much longer than that, and it includes a young man named Danroy "DJ" Henry."Ten years ago, we lost our son in the street — handcuffed. And here we are, 10 years later, George Floyd dies in the street, being handcuffed," DJ's mom, Angella Henry, told CBS News special correspondent James Brown.

The group says it plans to use that time to learn more about racial injustices and how members can better address them in the future. "In the wake of the most recent murders of Black people in the US, it is clear that white and other non-Black people have to step up and do the work to eradicate anti-Black racism," the website for "Shut Down STEM" says. "Our responsibility starts with our role in society. In academia, our thoughts and words turn into new ways of knowing. Our research papers turn into media releases, books and legislation that reinforce anti-Black narratives. In STEM, we create technologies that affect every part of our society and are routinely weaponized against Black people."Wednesday's strike is a call to action for those in the STEM field to stop meetings, research, classes, and other usual activities to instead focus on "education, action, and healing." Read more here.                                         9:41 PM / June 9, 2020       CBS News airs "Justice for All" primetime special hosted by Gayle King                                                         CBS News Special: "Justice for All"      53:32                                      As protests continue to grip the nation following the death of George Floyd, "CBS This Morning" co-host Gayle King anchored "Justice for All," a one-hour primetime special that explored how this tragic confrontation ignited a movement demanding an end to the painful history of systemic racism and brutality in police departments across the country. The special included "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell's exclusive interview with former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and also featured interviews with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah).Jeff Pegues, CBS News' chief justice and homeland security correspondent — who has been reporting on the ground in Minneapolis since Floyd's death and has written two books on policing in America — looked at the collision course that brought Floyd and former officer Derek Chauvin together."Justice for All" also featured King's interview with Christian Cooper, the target of a racist incident in Central Park when a white woman called police and falsely claimed he was threatening her life after he asked her to put her dog on a leash.                                         9:32 PM / June 9, 2020       George Floyd's body arrives at cemetery                             A horse-drawn carriage carried George Floyd's body into a cemetery in the Houston suburb of Pearland on Tuesday.

Not only did they know each other, but a former coworker says they had a history of friction.Floyd and Chauvin both worked security at a nightclub at the same time. Coworker David Pinney said the two men had a history."They bumped heads," Pinney said.

"We pride ourselves on being an organization willing to learn and evolve, to listen to our community and become better."   It’s an honor to have Phoenix represented on this committee.

Executive Cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said that damage prevented bullet fragments from being linked to a specific firearm. On the night of his death, McAtee was serving food at an outdoor stand amid protests over the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said the incident occurred after the Louisville Metro Police Department and the National Guard tried to disperse a group of protesters. The Louisville Metro Police Department said McAtee fired at the officers first, according to WLKY. State investigators also believe McAtee fired first, Brown said. When asked if McAtee could have misperceived pepper balls as bullets, Brown said the sound of a pepper ball firing is not comparable to that of a bullet.                                         4:56 PM / June 9, 2020       Private ceremony for Floyd planned at cemetery                             People are being allowed to walk up to the mausoleum in suburban Houston where George Floyd's body is set to be entombed.Some people took photos Tuesday as they got a closer look at the site in the cemetery in Pearland, Texas.

According to DPS, it was only done in certain situations. Photos and videos were posted showing the damage done to tires. Jeff Wagner, a local reporter who was covering the protests, shared pictures of cars with deflated tires in a Kmart parking lot. Read more here.                                         4:19 PM / June 9, 2020       Al Sharpton: "Floyd could have been anybody"                             Reverend Al Sharpton said George Floyd's death has ushered in a monumental change in the world's reaction to racism. Sharpton pointed to international protests that are no longer being led by black people alone. "I've seen whites walking past curfew saying Black Lives Matter," he said. "You have to reap the wrath of people who don't want to be wicked no more."Sharpton said God chose Floyd for this moment because he is representative of so many other people suffering under the same oppression. "Floyd could have been anybody, but the reaction was not anything," he said."God always uses unlikely people to do his will… God took an ordinary brother, from the third ward, from the housing projects… and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's going to change the whole wide world."Sharpton stressed that this is not the end of his involvement in the movement, saying he will be at the trial of the officers charged with Floyd's murder. He reminded people that this year's anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28 will also honor Floyd."We're going to keep marching, we're going to keep protesting," he said.

You've been silent long enough, you can be silent one more day.'""But... you asked the whole community to come together," he said, calling the family "a model for not just America, but for the whole world.""You have been asked to carry a burden that would have crushed most people, and you have borne it with grace and courage," he said. "You've called those who disrupted protests with violence or looting to honor George's life with love. You called on a president who sought to dominate to live in a peaceful world where we deliberate."Wells concluded by sharing that at his church, "it is easy to not talk about racism." "At my church, it is easy to dismiss as politics the economics of hundreds of years of systemic racism, but not talking and not acting is the path to destruction."He said of white people: "You have to take up the work of racial justice.""Racism did not start in our lifetimes, but racism can end in our lifetime. But only if you ask and I ask: 'What are we going to do about it?'"                                         3:31 PM / June 9, 2020       Grammy winner Ne-Yo says Floyd changed the world                             Grammy-winning singer Ne-Yo said George Floyd's death was a sacrifice that "changed the world" before performing during his memorial service.

Lee said during Floyd's memorial service on Tuesday that his death helped shine a light on police brutality against unarmed black men and women."I want to acknowledge those young marchers in the streets," she said. "Many of them could not be in this place. They are black and brown, they are Asian. They are white. They are protesting and marching. And I'm saying as a momma, 'I hear your cry.' That is what George Floyd wanted us to know."Lee said she is unable to remove the Floyd's last words "I can't breathe" from her head. But the congresswoman said his death served a purpose."His assignment turned into a purpose," she said. "And that purpose was heard around the world. There are people rising up that will never sit down until you get justice."

"There's a real big change going on and everybody, especially black, right now should be a part of that," said Kersey Biagase, who traveled more than three hours from Port Barre, Louisiana, with his girlfriend, Brandi Pickney. The couple wore matching T-shirts she designed, printed with Floyd's name and "I Can't Breathe," the words he uttered before his death. Several police officers from Texas Southern University stood guard at the sanctuary entrance, wearing face masks printed with Floyd's dying words.

The message will be painted first on a street near City Hall, and then other locations in other boroughs in the days to come, the mayor said, CBS New York reports."A proposal put on the table was to name streets in each borough and to paint the words on the streets of this city. In each borough, at a crucial location," de Blasio said. "What will be clear in the street name and on the streets of our city is that message that now our city must fully, fully, deeply feel - and this nation must as well - that Black Lives Matter."The move comes after the mayor of Washington D.C. had "Black Lives Matter" painted on a street in huge letters near the White House.

"We will not wake up one day and have the disease of systemic racism cured. We must do everything in our power to come together to deconstruct generations of systemic racism in our state so that every Minnesotan - black, indigenous, brown, or white - can be safe and thrive."The governor is asking that the moment of silence start at 11 a.m. local time (12 p.m. ET), when Floyd's funeral is scheduled to start, and last for 8 minutes and 46 seconds.

He is the first NYPD officer to be charged for his conduct during the city's ongoing wave of protests for police reform.Vincent D'Andraia, who has been in the NYPD for five years, is charged with misdemeanor assault, criminal mischief, harassment and menacing, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. The 28-year-old cop was suspended without pay after videos posted on Twitter showed him shoving a woman at a Brooklyn protest on May 29."I fully support the long-held American tradition of non-violent protest. As District Attorney I cannot tolerate the use of excessive force against anyone exercising this Constitutionally guaranteed right," Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement. "This is especially true of those who are sworn to protect us and uphold the law. I am deeply troubled by this unnecessary assault. We will now seek to hold this defendant accountable."Read more here.                                         10:40 AM / June 9, 2020       George Floyd to be laid to rest in Pearland                             George Floyd will be laid to rest on Tuesday at a cemetery in Pearland, Texas, following his funeral.CBS affiliate KHOU reports his body is expected to arrive there around 1 p.m., and that he will be in a horse-drawn carriage for the last mile of the funeral procession."The public is certainly welcome to pay respects at public locations on the route, including on sidewalks," the city said.

Since the recent news of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, his mother, Kadiatou Diallo, told "CBS This Morning" co-host Gayle King she felt like she was reliving what happened to her son all over again."As the mother of Amadou Diallo, having to suffer my loss on February 4, 1999, my wound was open again," she said.Diallo became an activist in the years since Amadou's death, working to improve relations between police and the community. She said George Floyd's heartbreaking last minutes of life, in which he repeatedly said "I can't breathe" and begged for his own mother, struck a chord with her."Every mother heard him," when Floyd cried out for her, she said.

Tactics they used initially were toned down after several days, but not without bringing the department under fire itself first, CBS Denver reports. 	"Any time an excessive crowd control measure like tear gas and rubber bullets and flash bang grenades and the like, anytime they are used against Denver citizens by Denver police I think it's incumbent on city council to dig in," councilman Paul Kashmann said. 	Kashmann chairs the safety committee of the Denver City Council, and with the full support of his fellow council members is calling for an investigation by the Office of Independent Monitor. "Take a look. Does Denver have the correct use of force policy in place? And if they do, was it properly implemented during the demonstrations?" he asked. The request comes as complaints against DPD for excessive force continue to build through emails, calls and even directly from the council floor.  According to a spokesperson for the police department, Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen and Executive Director of Public Safety Murphy Robinson acknowledge and support calls to review the use of force policy from Denver City Council.                                         9:06 AM / June 9, 2020       San Jose police chief announces changes to policies                             San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia announced crowd control policy changes in a memo to his officers Monday, more than a week after violent clashes between his police force and protesters. The changes include restrictions on the use of projectiles such as rubber bullets to disperse crowds, CBS SF Bay Area reports.The department has been accused of excessive force and misconduct after complaints were filed, injuries were reported and cell phone videos surfaced of violent confrontations."Effective immediately in crowd control situations ... Projectile Impact Weapons will only be used in situations where a person is actively attacking an officer or another person or when an armed agitator poses a threat to officers or other peaceful protesters," Garcia wrote in his memo.He also said, "The current department policy prohibits the use of chokeholds ... however, given recent events, we are updating policy language to clearly and expressly prohibit chokeholds using any body part to apply pressure to the neck including the knee."Garcia ended the memo voicing his support to prohibit officers fired for gross misconduct from being hired at other departments.                                         8:28 AM / June 9, 2020       George Floyd to be laid to rest next to his mother                             George Floyd, who was 46 when he was killed, will be laid to rest on Tuesday next to his mother. His funeral in Houston will be private.Floyd's death sparked international protests and drew new attention to the treatment of African Americans in the U.S. by police and the criminal justice system. In the past two weeks, sweeping and previously unthinkable things have taken place: Confederate statues have been toppled, police departments around America have rethought the way they patrol minority neighborhoods, legislatures have debated use-of-force policies, and white, black and brown people have had uncomfortable, sometimes heated, discussions about race in a nation that is supposed to ensure equal opportunity for all.

George Floyd has not died in vain. His life will be a living legacy about the way that America and Texas responds to this tragedy," Abbott said.Abbott said he planned to meet privately with Floyd's family and present them with a Texas flag that was flown over the state Capitol in Floyd's honor.
