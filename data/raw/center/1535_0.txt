         Moderna Inc.        MRNA -11.77%       said it asked U.S. and European health regulators Monday to authorize use of its Covid-19 vaccine, after it was shown to be 94.1% effective in a full analysis of a pivotal study.The timing keeps the vaccine on track to become possibly the second to go into use in the U.S. by year’s end—after one already under regulatory review from Pfizer Inc. and         BioNTech SE    —with inoculation available to the general public likely in spring or summer. Moderna said some doses also could become available in Europe in December. In the 30,000-person trial, 196 subjects developed Covid-19 with symptoms after receiving either the vaccine or a placebo, Moderna said. Of those, 185 had taken a placebo, while only 11 had gotten the vaccine, indicating it protects against the disease.        
The Race for a Vaccine        Moderna also said the vaccine appeared to be generally safe, though some subjects developed headaches and other mild to moderate reactions.          “I think this vaccine is going to be really a game changer for this pandemic,” Moderna Chief Executive         Stéphane Bancel    said in an interview. “We think it can really prevent severe disease.”     If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clears the shot, distribution could start within weeks.     A panel of outside experts advising the FDA will meet Dec. 17 to review the evidence for the company’s vaccine and vote on whether to recommend that the agency authorize its emergency use.     A similar meeting has been set for Dec. 10 for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.                                                 ‘I think this vaccine is going to be really a game changer for this pandemic,’ Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said.

Moderna designed its vaccine with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in January. The vaccine’s late-stage, or Phase 3, trial began in July.     In the trial, study subjects randomly received two injections of either a vaccine or placebo, four weeks apart. Researchers tracked who developed Covid-19 with symptoms starting two weeks after the second dose.     Moderna two weeks ago reported preliminary results from the first 95 Covid-19 cases to emerge in the trial, indicating the shot was 94.5% effective and looking safe.     Since then, another 101 volunteers developed symptomatic disease, enough to finish the analysis and potentially satisfy regulators.     In the final analysis, the company said there were 30 severe cases among the 196 total cases of Covid-19, and that all of them were among people who had gotten the placebo.                  “‘The confirmation of high efficacy in the large sample is tremendous news for this vaccine.’”                — Kathleen Neuzil, professor of vaccinology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine            The most common side effects, the company said, included pain around the injection site, fatigue and headache. Moderna said the reactions increase in frequency and severity after the second dose of the vaccine.     The company now has two months of safety data following the second dose for at least half of the study subjects—a threshold the FDA is requiring before authorizing any Covid-19 vaccine.     The results were for adults ages 18 and older, and the vaccine’s effectiveness was consistent across age, race and ethnicity and gender demographics, Moderna said.     A committee of outside experts reviewed the performance of the vaccine and reported the results to Moderna.                                         Health experts say having a vaccine is just one front in a two-front battle against COVID-19. The other is effective treatments for those who are already sick with the disease.

The performance suggests Moderna’s vaccine, like the candidate from Pfizer and BioNTech, works about as well as older vaccines such as measles and shingles shots.     “The confirmation of high efficacy in the large sample is tremendous news for this vaccine,” said Kathleen Neuzil, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. She said it looks like the shot could “positively impact the trajectory of the pandemic.”     Because of time constraints, researchers don’t know whether inoculation stops the spread of the virus and how long the protection against symptomatic Covid-19 conferred by the vaccine lasts.     Health authorities have been awaiting the advent of vaccines to fight off a virus that has swamped hospitals with patients and forced economies to shut down. Cases are surging in the U.S. and some other countries.     Vaccines developed in China and Russia have already gone into use, while         AstraZeneca    PLC recently said its vaccine was 62% to 90% effective, depending on the doses taken, in late-stage trials in the U.K. and Brazil.     AstraZeneca’s vaccine, co-developed with the University of Oxford, is on track to go into distribution in the West before the end of the year, though possibly not in the U.S. if additional testing is required.     Moderna’s vaccine, like the one from Pfizer and BioNTech, uses a gene-based technology known as messenger RNA after the molecules that carry DNA instructions for making proteins.     The vaccines carry genetic code that teaches human cells how to produce a protein resembling the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus.          Production of the spike protein, researchers say, will trigger an immune response that can ward off disease if a vaccinated person subsequently is exposed to the virus.     Health officials and scientists view mRNA as a promising new way to make vaccines, but no such vaccine has been licensed for use before.     It is unclear how long the FDA will take to make a decision on permitting use. Mr. Bancel said it is possible the agency could decide within a few days of the advisory panel meeting, or between Dec. 18 and Dec. 20.     Given the urgent need, the FDA plans to conduct a faster review than it normally would, resulting in an authorization for emergency use.     An emergency-use authorization is different from the standard, more time-consuming approval typically issued by the FDA.     The FDA has granted such authorizations for Covid-19 drugs including the antiviral remdesivir from         Gilead Sciences Inc.    and most recently, antibody therapies from         Eli Lilly    & Co. and         Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.         The agency has said that while its review will be faster than normal, it will hold Covid-19 vaccines to the high standards required of any vaccine.     Moderna expects to have 20 million doses by the end of the year, enough for about 10 million people. Pfizer also expects to have a limited supply of its vaccine this year.     Given the limited initial supplies, health officials may decide to first vaccinate front-line health workers such as those in hospitals and nursing homes, and first responders.     A panel of experts advising the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to meet Tuesday to vote on recommendations for who should get vaccinated first.                                         As wealthier countries buy up supplies of Western drugmakers’ Covid-19 vaccines that are still in development, China and Russia are offering their fast-tracked shots to poorer nations. Here’s what they're hoping to get in return.

To meet the demand for a Covid-19 vaccine, the company has been expanding production capacity, including through a partnership with contract manufacturer Lonza Ltd.     Moderna and its manufacturing partners expect to make between 500 million and one billion doses in 2021.     The federal government has agreed to purchase 100 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine for about $1.5 billion, with an option to buy additional doses. The government also has supply deals with other leading vaccine developers such as Pfizer,         Johnson & Johnson    and AstraZeneca.     The government will direct the distribution of doses—at no cost to recipients—and is working with state and local immunization programs to get the shots into the arms of people, though plans aren’t completed.

As supplies increase, the vaccine is expected to be rolled out in phases to different populations. Other priority groups include people 65 years and older living in nursing homes, transit workers and teachers.     In recent days, federal officials overseeing the vaccine effort have said the general population not in the high-priority groups could begin to get access to any vaccines in spring and summer of 2021.     Temperature control will be important in the rollout. Moderna’s vaccine must be shipped and kept in long-term storage at four degrees below zero Fahrenheit, which Moderna says is equal to most home or medical freezer temperatures.     Once thawed, the vaccine is expected to remain stable at standard refrigeration temperatures of 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 30 days. It can stay at room temperature for up to 12 hours.     Pfizer’s vaccine also must be kept largely at cold temperatures, with shipping and long-term storage requiring colder temperatures than Moderna’s.     Other leading vaccine candidates, including AstraZeneca’s, use different technology, and don’t need to be kept at such low temperatures.     Johnson & Johnson and         Novavax Inc.    are also testing other vaccines in late-stage clinical trials, and could have results in weeks or months.     Russia said recently its vaccine had 92% efficacy in an interim analysis of a large trial.     Moderna shares rose 20.2% to $152.74 Monday. The stock traded just below $20 at the start of the year.     Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
