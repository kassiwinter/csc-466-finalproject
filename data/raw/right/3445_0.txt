President Donald Trump affirmed his belief that he can pardon himself for any crime but said he would never do so because he has done nothing wrong. As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2018 Trump’s tweets follow comments from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on ABCNews that Trump “probably does” have the authority to pardon himself but carefully added, “He has no intention of pardoning himself.” “I think the political ramifications of that would be tough. Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another. Other presidents have pardoned people in circumstances like this, both in their administration and sometimes the next president even of a different party will come along and pardon,” Giuliani added. “In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted,” he later told The Huffington Post saying “I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is.”
