At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., the Obama campaign was careful to say the jobs picture wouldn't improve quickly. The closest officials came to optimism was when Vice President Joe Biden declared that the economy had "turned the corner."Friday's jobs data emphatically supported the president's more cautious view. Another weak employment report, which arrived just hours after President Barack Obama accepted his party's nomination, refocused voters on the sluggish recovery just as the campaign is entering the home stretch. The Labor Department said the economy created just 96,000 jobs in August, almost 30,000 fewer than expected. The unemployment rate fell to 8.1% from 8.3%, largely because hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans stopped looking for work. The percentage of people participating in the labor market in August fell to its lowest rate in 31 years.     The report virtually ensures that Mr. Obama will try to be the first incumbent president to win reelection with such high unemployment since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 and 1940. The report also is a test of the White House's strategy to call for voters to remain patient in the face of economic weakness that has persisted longer than many expected.               Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said the party faced the challenge of telling voters their plan to fix the economy was working while stopping short of offering too upbeat a portrait of where things stood.     "People know from their own experience what life is like," Mr. Mellman said. "And if you try and tell them life is better than they think, then there are only two alternatives they can reach—that they don't understand their own lives or you are out of touch."      Economic data can bounce around, due to revisions and seasonal adjustments, but the August jobs figures were more significant than most. This is one of the last major economic reports before voters cast ballots in November, and it comes during a crucial period when independent voters are deciding whom to support.     Friday's Labor Department report complements other recent figures that reflect the weak recovery. The economy grew just 1.7% in the second quarter, the deficit has eclipsed $1 trillion for the fourth consecutive year and total government debt reached a record $16 trillion. Many economists don't expect the economy to improve markedly before the election, meaning the recent batch of reports could serve as the most complete backdrop when voters go to the polls.     Democrats say they expect the White House, in addition to counseling patience, to continue making the case that its policies are far better for the middle class than those offered by the Republican ticket.     Echoing the tone of his convention speech, Mr. Obama, stumping in New Hampshire Friday, said he wasn't satisfied with the jobs numbers, calling them not "good enough." "I'm not going to pretend that this path is quick or easy," he said. "And by the way, I never have."     Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called the report evidence that Mr. Obama's economic policies had failed, calling the economy's struggles a "national tragedy."     "There's almost nothing the president has done in the past three and a half, four years, that gives the American people confidence that he knows what he's doing when it comes to jobs and the economy," Mr. Romney said Friday in Iowa.     A senior administration official said it is too early to know whether Friday's jobs report will damp any polling bounce Mr. Obama may have earned coming out of the convention, which ended Thursday night.The official added, however, that the weak number, which was below economists' expectations of roughly 125,000 new jobs, won't help.     "I think it reminds people of what they already know: the economy is healing but too slowly, and there will be some focus that the job production is a little off expectations," the official said.     After falling from a high of 10% in October 2009, the unemployment rate has mostly leveled off during the past eight months, at least two percentage points higher than many economists believe is its "natural" level.     There will be just two more jobs reports before the election, one in early October and another four days before the election. Friday's release is the last report before Messrs. Obama and Romney have their first debate on Oct. 3.     —Sara Murray contributed to this article.
