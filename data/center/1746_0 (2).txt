LAUSANNE, Switzerland—Nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers crashed through another deadline on Tuesday, casting doubt about whether the two sides can reach a final deal to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.In the early morning hours Wednesday, there were some signs of progress toward building a framework outlining elements of a final nuclear deal to be reached by June 30. “We’ve made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday,” said State Department spokeswoman         Marie Harf.    “There are several difficult issues still remaining.”                                                  Head of Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi during a break in a meeting with world representatives in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Tuesday.

Russian Foreign Minister         Sergei Lavrov    said the sides reached agreement in principle, according to his spokeswoman. The parties would try to finalize a text later on Wednesday, she added.                But people involved in the talks have said many tough details would still be left over even if a framework agreement is reached.     The two big sticking points were the timetable for lifting United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran and the question of what nuclear work Tehran would be permitted to do in the final years of an agreement. Late Tuesday night, diplomats said some inroads had been made but differences on these points remained.                                         The 1979 Iranian Revolution set the stage for today’s tough negotiations over Iran’s alleged nuclear ambitions. WSJ’s Jason Bellini has The Short History of Iran’s revolutionary ideals.                                                                                                     Still the         Obama    administration was forced to accede to the third delay in less than a year in the talks, stoking new criticism from Congress about the direction of the White House Iran policy.     The deadline has been seized on by U.S. lawmakers who have warned that they would push for fresh sanctions legislation on Iran if a framework agreement isn’t reached on time.     Many lawmakers—Republicans and Democrats—believe the terms of the deal won’t go far enough in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.      Senate Republicans are pushing legislation in April that would give Congress the power to approve, amend or kill any deal announced by the Obama administration.                                         As talks with Iran stretch past a previously set deadline, the White House is discussing its options in case of failure to reach a nuclear deal.

Tom Cotton    (R., Ark.). Mr. Cotton penned a letter to Iran’s leadership in March, signed by 47 Republican senators, that said Congress had the power to overrule any agreement signed by the White House.      U.S. officials and other senior Western diplomats have said in the past few days that with Congress out on recess, they had a few days more political space to hammer out the details.     The talks have encountered few successes since they began in early 2014.      Negotiators failed to meet two deadlines in July and November last year, setting Tuesday as the final day to reach a framework of an agreement and the end of June as the deadline for a comprehensive deal.     President Barack Obama in February said he saw little point to any further delays.          An Iranian diplomat told state-run television on Tuesday that some progress had been made on the sanctions issues.      “We don’t want an agreement at any price. We want to guarantee the Iranian people’s honor and rights…Our goal is this. Time won’t stop us,” said the senior negotiator,         Hamid Baeedinejad.         The U.S. and its European partners at the talks have long said Iran would only win phased sanctions relief with some U.N. restrictions on nuclear-related trade remaining in place. However, Iran was pushing for sanctions relief up front.     Iran was also doubling down on its insistence that after 10 years, it would have no tight restrictions on its nuclear program, including its research work, Western diplomats said. U.S. and European officials have said some of those constraints must stay in place.     After an official said French Foreign Minister         Laurent Fabius    could leave early Wednesday morning, a senior U.S. official said there was no discussion of giving Iran an immediate ultimatum to make concessions or end the diplomacy.

However, over the past 18 months, as the diplomacy heated up, the U.S. and its partners have dropped a number of conditions they once set for a deal.     As the diplomacy has dragged on, skepticism has risen in Washington and elsewhere that a strong deal can be reached.     Critics of the diplomacy say the U.S. and other powers have accepted terms that will embolden Iran in regional power struggles and do little over time to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. Fueling that debate will be the many questions an agreement will leave unanswered.     U.S. officials have said the deal is a good compromise which will meet its central goal of blocking any of Iran’s paths to an atomic weapon.

Missing Tuesday’s deadline has no automatic consequences for the talks. The interim agreement reached in November 2013 remains in effect until the end of June.      At various points in the past decade, the negotiations have appeared on the brink of collapse, raising the prospect of a military conflict with Iran.      While diplomats had appeared confident earlier in the day that a deal could be reached Tuesday, officials described discussions as hard-going as the talks dragged on.     A German delegation official said the negotiations had been very tough.     “Whether it will succeed remains open,” said the official.      —Jay Solomon in Washington and Asa Fitch in Dubai contributed to this article.
