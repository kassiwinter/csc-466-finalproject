WASHINGTON—For the second time in two weeks, President Trump has chosen a nominee to the Federal Reserve Board who hails from outside mainstream economics circles and is seen as sympathetic to his goals.         Herman Cain,    the president’s latest choice to join the powerful policy-making body, rose from a humble childhood to contend for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Along the way he served at the Kansas City Fed, was chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza and headed a major restaurant lobbying group. He has taken controversial positions with regard to the Fed and other policy issues, including a call to return the U.S. to a gold standard, which links the value of a dollar to the price of gold. The U.S. abandoned a gold standard in the Great Depression, reinstituted it and then abandoned it again in the 1970s. Many economists argue a gold standard handcuffs the central bank in a downturn.     “However imperfect a gold standard may be, it remains the best among all alternatives,” Mr. Cain wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial in 2012. “Gold is kryptonite to big-spending politicians. It is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires.”          In a         Facebook    video show with 24,000 followers that opens with the line, “Aw shucky ducky,” a sweater-vest-clad Mr. Cain comments daily about Democratic politicians, argues in favor of Mr. Trump’s trade disputes and border wall and cheers the president’s economic policies. In the past month or so, he has accused Democrats of seeking to “brainwash” the nation, “murder kids” and “rig the next election.”     “Tax policy, regulatory rollback, opening up energy development! That’s what caused this economic prosperity,” Mr. Cain said in a raised voice in a recent episode. “Some people drank the Kool-Aid and believed that President Obama’s policies had something to do with economic prosperity. No they didn’t! His policies moved us economically backward, instead of economically forward!”     Pausing to catch his breath, Mr. Cain addressed viewers: “I’m not mad at you all, I just get a little passionate about this.”     Mr. Trump said Thursday he intends to nominate Mr. Cain for a position on the Fed’s board of governors in Washington, a job that would empower him to vote on financial-regulatory policies and interest-rate policies that have large effects on markets and consumer mortgage, credit card and auto loans.     In his first two years in office, Mr. Trump succeeded in confirming four nominees to the seven-member Federal Reserve Board:         Jerome Powell,         Richard Clarida,         Randal Quarles    and         Michelle Bowman.    All were widely regarded as mainstream picks in line with the central bank’s culture of nonpartisanship and political independence, seen by many economists and investors as important to the Fed’s task of keeping inflation in check.     On March 22, he offered a board position to conservative commentator Stephen Moore, who has bashed recent Fed interest-rate increases and wrote a book called “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy” that touts the president’s economic policies.     The vetting process of Mr. Cain could subject the 73-year-old to new scrutiny of sexual-assault accusations that surfaced during his 2012 presidential campaign. The accusations, denied by Mr. Cain, had resulted in settlements by the National Restaurant Association, where he served for several years as chief executive officer.     Mr. Cain wasn’t reachable for comment.     Raised in Atlanta, Mr. Cain said on the campaign trail that he “can connect to people’s pain because I was ‘po’ before I was poor. My dad worked three jobs; I understand what that means.”     After graduating with a mathematics degree from Morehouse College in 1967 and a master’s in computer science from Purdue University, he pursued a corporate career at         Coca-Cola    and the Pillsbury Co. before becoming CEO of Godfather’s Pizza. From 1992 to 1996, he served as a director at the Kansas City Fed, including a stint as chairman of the reserve bank’s board.     A former staffer on his presidential campaign said that while Mr. Cain is a “strong, ideological conservative,” he showed a willingness to listen and change his views when presented with convincing evidence.     “One of his big mantras was, ‘Listen to the experts,’” the ex-staffer said.
