         WASHINGTON—President      Donald Trump        appeared to draw an equivalence between Russian President Vladimir         Putin    and the behavior of the U.S. when he responded to a remark about Mr. Putin being a “killer” by saying: “We got a lot of killers—what, you think our country’s so innocent?”     The statement, made in an interview with Fox News host         Bill O’Reilly    that will air before Sunday’s Super Bowl, came after Mr. Trump again said he respected the Russian president and Russia could help in the fight against Islamic State and other terrorists. Excerpts of the interview were released Saturday.      “I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not,” Mr. Trump said, though he added that he didn’t know whether he and Mr. Putin would hit it off.     “But he’s a killer,” Mr. O’Reilly interjected.

His remarks starkly contrast with comments made earlier in the week by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,         Nikki Haley,    who told her first meeting of the U.N. Security Council that an increase in violence in eastern Ukraine “demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.”     Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea, its support of an armed opposition elsewhere in Ukraine, and its often-violent treatment of critics of its regime have been widely condemned in the U.S. and Europe.     Mr. Trump made a similar comment before he was elected. In December 2015, MSNBC host         Joe Scarborough    said to Mr. Trump that Mr. Putin “kills journalists that don’t agree with him.”     Mr. Trump, according to a transcript of the interview, responded: “Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe.”     Mr. Trump’s critics, including some Republican party leaders, have said the president is too soft on a nation that is challenging and complicating U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.     U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia, at Mr. Putin’s direction, mounted a campaign to influence the American election in Mr. Trump’s favor through cyber-hacking as part of a broader ambition to undermine Western liberalism.     Mr. Trump has consistently defended the Russian leader and expressed skepticism about the intelligence community’s claims before ultimately agreeing with the agencies’ findings.
