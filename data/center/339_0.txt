Gomez,    the archbishop of Los Angeles, as president of their joint organization on Tuesday, making him the first Latino ever to hold the position.     Archbishop Gomez has served as the vice president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for the past three years. His elevation from that position to president is customary for the group. The archdiocese of Los Angeles is home to the largest number of Catholics in the nation.      An immigrant from Mexico who is now a U.S. citizen, Archbishop Gomez is an outspoken advocate for migrant rights, an issue which has frequently put the bishops at odds with the Trump administration.     “I’m humbled by your support,” Archbishop Gomez said to the bishops, who are gathered in Baltimore for their annual meeting, after his election. “I think it is a special blessing for the Latino community.”               Write to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
