                 | August 15, 2021 02:58 PM                New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday said she aims to create a "completely ethical" administration when she becomes the state's first female governor, following Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation stemming from multiple sexual misconduct claims.      During an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, Hochul said she wanted the women who were allegedly harassed by Cuomo to know the "culture will be changed 1000%" for "all women" working in the governor's office.            "I want every young woman, just like I was a high school assembly intern, to realize that this is a place where they have a role. We need their voices. We need that diversity. We're getting there. We're making progress on more elected women," she said.      INCOMING NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL PLANS TO RUN FOR FULL TERM IN 2022      Cuomo allegedly sexually harassed nearly a dozen women, including "engaging in unwelcome and nonconsensual touching," according to the findings of a report released on Aug. 3 by New York Attorney General Letitia James. He announced his resignation a week later on Aug. 10, following massive political pressure from fellow leaders, both Democratic and Republican, including President Joe Biden. Cuomo will leave office on Aug. 24.      Hochul said she plans to "have conversations" with the women who accused Cuomo of sexual misdeeds. By the end of her administration, the future New York governor said she wants "for every woman to say there are no barriers, there is no longer a ceiling."      Last week, Hochul announced her intent to run for reelection and a full term as governor in 2022, and she noted Sunday she has not yet selected a new lieutenant governor. Hochul first assumed office in 2015 and ran for reelection in 2018.

"That is how I've conducted my life since I've been an elected official, 27 years, and also just let people know it's a whole new era now. And I'm excited about this."
