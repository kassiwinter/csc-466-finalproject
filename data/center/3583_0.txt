President Trump said he would be willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart without first demanding diplomatic concessions, the latest public overture involving nations he has also condemned and called a threat to American safety and economic security.The remark by Mr. Trump, in response to a question at a White House news conference Monday, was another example of his off-the-cuff style of diplomacy. It came just a week after he traded threats with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. Top White House advisers said there had been no internal planning for a potential meeting with the Iranian president. Aides said they were “working a response” to Mr. Trump’s remarks. In a televised interview later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed preconditions for such a meeting, in contrast to Mr. Trump’s offer.     The president’s expressed openness to meet with Mr. Rouhani came less than three months after he withdrew the U.S. from the international accord aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump criticized Iran as the “biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world.”               Mr. Trump’s remarks evoked his approach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he met in June, just 10 months after threatening Pyongyang with “fire and fury like world has never seen.”     Similarly, Mr. Trump has sought to tighten diplomatic relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, after accusing Beijing of manipulating its currency and “raping our country” on trade. He privately met for more than two hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki earlier this month after his top intelligence officials identified Moscow as responsible for attempting to disrupt U.S. elections in 2016 by hacking into emails of American citizens and aiming to undermine state election processes.     In a national-security document, unveiled in December, the president identified Russia, China, North Korea and Iran as among the main threats to American security, prosperity and allies.     “I’ll meet with anybody,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, when asked about his willingness to sit down with Mr. Rouhani. “I believe in meeting.”     Asked if he would set any conditions before sitting for such talks, Mr. Trump said, “No. If they want to meet, I’ll meet.”     Iranian officials in Tehran and at the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mahmoud Vaeiz, Mr. Rouhani’s chief of staff, told reporters this month that Mr. Trump was repeatedly rebuffed at the U.N. General Assembly last year when he sought meetings with the Iranian president, according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency.     He also said Iranians “will not yield to pressure,” unlike North Korea.     Mr. Pompeo on Monday suggested the likelihood of more conditions for a high-level meeting.     “If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he’s prepared to sit down and have the conversation with them,” he said, in an interview on CNBC.     The White House National Security Council said later that Mr. Trump is open to “dialogue and negotiation,” but that Tehran would have to take action to escape U.S. economic sanctions that have put stress on the Islamic Republic’s economy.     “Relief is only possible if there are tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran’s policies. Until then, the sting of sanctions will only grow more painful if the regime does not change course,” said NSC spokesman Garrett Marquis.     Cliff Kupchan, chairman of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said a Trump-Rouhani meeting was unlikely because the U.S. administration’s demands appear to be non-starters: a commitment to not enrich uranium, stopping missile tests and pledges to change its military posture in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Surrogates may hold meetings in Oman or other neutral countries, he said, but anything more serious appeared unlikely under the watch of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say in state matters.     “Mr. Trump approaches meetings with Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin, and potentially Hassan Rouhani as, in part, reality TV events,” he said. “They’re exciting and really grab the news cycle. But Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei isn’t big on reality TV, or meeting with Americans. He won’t bite.”     Last week, Messrs. Trump and Rouhani swapped public taunts, escalating security concerns between the two nations when Mr. Rouhani warned the Trump administration against continuing hard-line policies against Iran. In comments that were tougher than usual for an Iranian president seen as a moderate, Mr. Rouhani said that “war with Iran is the mother of all wars.”     Mr. Trump responded with his own post on Twitter, emphasizing that Iran would “SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.”     During Monday’s news conference, Mr. Trump drew a parallel between his summits with Messrs. Kim and Putin and a potential meeting with Iranian officials, saying that Pyongyang hasn’t fired a missile in months and that he made progress with Moscow over “protecting Israel and protecting everybody.”     “Especially when you’re talking about potentials of war and death and famine and lots of other things, you meet,” Mr. Trump said.     Mr. Trump repeatedly has insisted that he is prepared to engage diplomatically with Iran and appeared to be modeling policy toward Tehran on the maximum pressure campaign that brought Pyongyang to the bargaining table.     But the demands the Trump administration has presented for any new Iran nuclear deal would require Iran to cease its support for militant groups in the Middle East and stop enriching all uranium, a stipulation that is stricter than the 2015 Iran accord.     Some experts outside government believe that while Mr. Trump talks of diplomacy, the goal of other senior officials is to use sanctions to weaken and perhaps even destabilize the Iranian regime.     Mr. Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have said Washington doesn’t have a policy of regime change but rather is reimposing sanctions to persuade the regime to pull back from its aggressive posture in the region—the deployment of forces in Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad and, U.S. officials say, the provisions of weapons to the Houthis in Yemen.     Mr. Trump’s attack on the nuclear deal has undercut Iran’s moderates, who were the driving force behind that diplomacy within the Iranian system. They saw the easing of sanctions that came along with that deal as key to the country’s prosperity, over the objections of hard-liners suspicious of the U.S. and the West.                                         With the U.S out of the Iran nuclear agreement, the Trump administration is clamping down on the Iranian regime. The Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib explains the sources of pressure.

Mr. Rouhani threatened early this month to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if the U.S. cut off its oil exports—the sort of invective often unleashed by hard-liners but rarely by moderates like Mr. Rouhani.      Before the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal, it tried to establish a back channel with Iran to negotiate over the release of other prisoners still held by the nation. Iran didn’t respond.     Iranian officials have quietly met with American officials many times to negotiate back-room deals. Such talks were a hallmark of the diplomacy that led to the 2015 nuclear deal. The Obama administration reached a prisoner-swap deal with Iran as the nuclear pact took effect and settled a long-running financial dispute about an arms deal by transferring $1.7 billion in cash to Iran.     —Peter Nicholas and Michael R.
