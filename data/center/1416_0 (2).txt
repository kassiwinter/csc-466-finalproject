The intruder who scaled a White House fence earlier this month and darted across the lawn got much farther into the executive mansion than previously disclosed, according to a congressman.Rep.         Jason Chaffetz    (R., Utah), who leads a House Oversight subcommittee that oversees the Secret Service, said he began hearing last week that         Omar J. Gonzalez    allegedly advanced well into the White House, making it as far as the East Room, located a floor below the first family's residence. "It's my understanding from whistleblowers that he did make it farther into the White House than previously reported, but I want to give the Secret Service director an opportunity to shed some light on that," Mr. Chaffetz said Monday.

The hearing will take place during a congressional recess—a rare occurrence that reflects the depth of concern about the Sept. 19 incident.                                                 A member of the Secret Service stands guard at the north entrance to the White House on Monday.

A spokesman said previous remarks expressing confidence in Ms. Pierson and the Secret Service remained valid. A Secret Service spokesman declined to comment.               Mr. Chaffetz questioned why the agency issued a Sept. 20 news release praising agents for showing "tremendous restraint."     "I thought they should have overwhelming force to make sure people never, ever make it into the White House," he said.      Mr. Chaffetz said he was told Mr. Gonzalez, an Iraq Army veteran who was carrying a folding knife, made it as far as the East Room, where the president holds news conferences and entertains on formal occasions, just off a stairway that leads to the first family's residence.                                                                                                                                                     An audible alarm had been muted because "the ushers thought it made too much noise," Mr. Chaffetz said he was told.     President         Barack Obama    and his family had left the White House for Camp David when the intrusion occurred at 7:20 p.m.     The revelations are the latest embarrassment for an agency that has suffered its share of black eyes. In 2012, the Secret Service removed 12 employees from duty after allegations they brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms in Cartagena, Colombia, before a presidential trip.     In March, three agents were sent home from Amsterdam after allegedly drinking while preparing for the president's arrival.                                                 Omar J.

Related           "I have deep concerns about leadership, protocol and training. The problems seem to be getting worse, not better," Mr. Chaffetz said. "This is an agency that can never, ever make a mistake, ever. There are a lot of good men and women who serve but their leadership is failing."      The Secret Service has said it's investigating what went wrong during the breach. In the Sept. 20 news release, the agency said the location of Mr. Gonzalez's arrest was "not acceptable," but didn't elaborate as to where he was arrested.     The statement left the impression that Mr. Gonzalez was caught inside the doors.

How much has the agency's budget grown? How much does it cost the Secret Service to screen the White House's mail? WSJ's Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer                                                                           Initially, the Secret Service said Mr. Gonzalez was unarmed. A sworn affidavit signed by a Secret Service officer the next day said he was carrying a knife in his pocket.     It's unclear whether Mr. Obama was told how far the intruder made it into the White House. White House spokesman         Josh Earnest    on Monday said the president was briefed "multiple times" on the evening of Sept. 19.     Mr. Obama and his chief of staff,         Denis McDonough,    also received briefings that weekend, Mr. Earnest told reporters Monday. Ms. Pierson came to the Oval Office on Sept. 25 and gave Mr. Obama the agency's "initial assessment of what occurred," Mr. Earnest said.     Mr. Gonzalez is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday.     Secret Service agents had twice interviewed Mr. Gonzalez but they didn't find cause to charge him with a crime or seek to have him committed for treatment of a mental illness, according to an agency official.     The Secret Service interviewed Mr. Gonzalez after his July arrest by Virginia State Police, who initially pulled Mr. Gonzalez over for reckless driving.     During a search of his car, state police said they found 11 guns and a map of Washington with a line drawn to the White House. The guns were stored by the state police after Mr. Gonzalez's car was towed, a state police spokeswoman said. He was released on bond, but the agency still has the guns.     A month ago, the Secret Service stopped Mr. Gonzalez near the south fence of the White House after he was spotted with a small hatchet in his waistband, a federal prosecutor said Monday.     Officers checked his name against agency databases and found that he recently had had contact with the Secret Service, an agency official said. Mr. Gonzalez allowed them to search his car, which he appeared to be living out of at the time, officials said, adding that they found only camping equipment and let him go.     —Peter Nicholas and Andrew Grossman contributed to this article.
