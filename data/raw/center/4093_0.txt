He's a veteran politician with the kind of executive experience that comes from being a governor of a mid-sized state. At a small session at the liberal Netroots Nation conference last August, the 68-year-old Inslee displayed a low-key confidence and command of the issues, with the kind of self-deprecating wit that can be effective disarming critics. He won't light up a stage like Senator Cory Booker or potential candidate Beto O'Rourke, but he's a comfortable public speaker.This isn't your father's Democratic Party, of course, and with a diverse range of candidates already in the race, Mr Inslee will be pressed to find breathing room for his campaign.His answer is to fashion himself as the environmental candidate. With the Green New Deal getting traction among progressives, Mr Inslee is touting his work addressing climate change in Washington state. He's launching his presidential bid at a solar panel factory whose success he attributes to his policies as governor.If Mr Inslee gets the attention of Democratic voters with his environmental pitch, he can then pivot to talking about his efforts to fight the Trump administration's immigration policies, expand healthcare in his state, raise the minimum wage, enact paid family medical leave, end capital punishment and pardon Washington residents previously convicted of now-legalised marijuana drug offences.It's a record of progressive accomplishment that the half-dozen senators already in the race, having toiled in the minority since 2014, can't match.Who is Jay Inslee?Jay Inslee is a fifth-generation Washingtonian, born and raised in Seattle. He is a former prosecutor and former congressman who represented the state of Washington in the House of Representatives for several terms in the 1990s.His father was a high school science teacher who helped spark his love of nature.Mr Inslee won the governorship in 2012, defeating a Republican and replacing Democratic incumbent Christine Gregoire. He took the seat after winning only eight counties out of the state's 39, losing the rural vote to his conservative opponent, according to the New York Times.He was the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, helping with campaigning efforts across the country.In December, he compared his presidential hopes with those of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, saying both former presidents were "unknown governors of small states" before winning the presidency, the Seattle Times reported.More on this story
