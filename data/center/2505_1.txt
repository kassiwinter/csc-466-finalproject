         Mike Pence    is in many ways      Donald Trump’s        opposite—an unfailingly polite and humble establishment Republican with a full head of naturally white hair and a wife of 31 years.“I’m kind of the B-list Republican celebrity,” the vice-presidential nominee and Indiana governor told several hundred supporters in Leetonia, Ohio, last Wednesday. “I’m not the main event.” He also has far better ties to mainstream Republicans, who now are counting on him to get the better of his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, on the debate stage Tuesday night. The stakes for that event have risen after Mr. Trump’s uneven debate performance last week against Democratic nominee         Hillary Clinton,    and after the publication of some of Mr. Trump’s tax records.                                         Mike Pence for Donald Trump and Tim Kaine for Hillary Clinton were chosen to run for their lack of controversy and also their lack of temperamental behavior. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why this could lead to a less fiery debate than those of their respective running mates.

While the New York businessman said he relied mostly on instinct going into his debate, Mr. Pence said he has spent several days in 90-minute mock debates, then studied video playbacks. A friend, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, played the part of Mr. Kaine.               “My goal is to show that Donald, a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers, will bring the bold change sought by everyday Americans voiced in their aspirations and frustrations,” Mr. Pence said in an interview aboard his plane during a three-state swing recently. “And I’ll contrast what I did in Indiana to Sen. Kaine in Virginia.”     Though the debate will be the most visible role Mr. Pence has played in the election, he has become the Trump ambassador to mainline Republicans and other conservatives—even to some “Never Trump” donors who previously pledged to stay on the sidelines.     “Mike is a committed conservative and perfect bridge” to segments of the Republican Party who were “excited and relieved” with Mr. Trump’s vice-presidential choice, said House Speaker         Paul Ryan,    who has expressed some misgivings about Mr. Trump.     Elected to the House in 2000, Mr. Pence rose to a GOP leadership position before leaving Congress in 2012 when he was elected governor. As he began a tough race for re-election this year, Mr. Pence got the call from the Trump camp asking if he would consider the vice-presidential slot.     For his “interview” during the July 4 weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Pence asked to spend “quality time” with Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, and to bring along his wife, Karen. The VP candidate got off to a potentially rocky start: He beat Mr. Trump on the first two of 18 holes, but then “the rest of my golf game revealed itself,” Mr. Pence recalled. Ultimately, he lost.         More on Election 2016                Since winning the No. 2 spot on the ticket, Mr. Pence has held private meetings with other 2016 contenders—often in their home states while he is on the trail—including Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Mr. Cruz and Ms. Fiorina recently endorsed Mr. Trump, though the others have balked.He also has visited Capitol Hill for intense chats with some lawmakers who have voiced concerns about Mr. Trump, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.     When Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, met recently with Mr. Pence, he recalls telling him, “Mike, we just don’t know Donald Trump, and I’m curious what he’s really like.” The vice-presidential nominee discussed Mr. Trump’s “great character traits,” Mr. Hensarling said. “Mike is fiercely loyal to him and is at peace with his role.”     That role has encompassed unflinching support and praise for Mr. Trump. On a morning TV show after the presidential debate, after which most pundits declared Mrs. Clinton the victor, Mr. Pence said, “The American people saw in Donald Trump the kind of leadership…that’s created the tremendous momentum in this campaign.”     That impressed Regina Garver, 70, a Democratic voter who met Mr. Pence Wednesday when he stopped at the Jib Jab Hot Dog Shoppe in Girard, Ohio. “The anchors tried to goad him into admitting Trump was terrible in the debate, but Pence was spot on and still polite,” said Ms. Garver, a retired auto-components inspector who said she is voting Trump.     At campaign rallies, Mr. Pence sticks to his script, written on big note cards. Most of them were crinkled and ink-smeared from a drenching rain when he spoke two weeks ago in historic Williamsburg, Va., where a crowd of 700, without umbrellas because of Secret Service rules, stayed for 45 minutes.     Lately, Mr. Pence has spent less time campaigning and more time on debate prep, including familiarizing himself with the record of Mr. Kaine, a former governor of Virginia. “He tried to raise taxes, and I lowered taxes every year,” Mr. Pence said, previewing a likely line.     Meantime, Mr. Pence is working the campaign-contribution circuit. Unlike Mr. Trump, who doesn’t enjoy making small talk or asking for help, his running mate is comfortable at fundraising events and in soliciting donations from the trail.     Mr. Pence is likely to be challenged over his signing of a law last year that would permit businesses in some cases to discriminate against gay and transgender people. Mr. Pence’s Indiana “was one of the first states to enact anti-gay laws, and a lot of people we love would be repressed if he and Trump are elected,” said Salesforce.com Chief Executive Marc Benioff, who led other chief executives to threaten business boycotts in Indiana. Lawmakers and Mr. Pence later revised the law.     Mr. Walker said that in debate sessions he has warned Mr. Pence of Mr. Kaine’s habit of answering questions genially before “pouncing” on his debate opponent.     He also appears to have helped persuade other important figures in the party to begin praising Trump positions, if not the candidate. Club for Growth, an anti-tax group that Mr. Trump once accused of trying to solicit a bribe for an endorsement, backed the Trump tax and regulatory policies after Mr. Pence was named.     Club for Growth’s president, David McIntosh, when asked about endorsing the GOP ticket, replied, “I’m supporting Mike Pence for vice president.”     Back at the Ohio rally on Wednesday, Mr. Pence tried to convince the crowd that despite their outward differences, “Donald Trump and I have a lot in common”—except, he added, for “a lot of zeros” in Mr. Trump’s net worth.
