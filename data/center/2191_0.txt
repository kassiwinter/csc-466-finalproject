Donald Trump’s rivals launched last-ditch efforts Sunday to derail the Republican presidential front-runner’s campaign, intensifying the competition ahead of voting Tuesday in 11 states that could all but seal the race’s outcome.Sen. Marco Rubio charged that Mr. Trump failed to denounce white supremacists, expanding his fevered pitch that the New York businessman is unfit to be the GOP standard-bearer. “We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan,” Mr. Rubio told hundreds of cheering supporters at Patrick Henry College, a Christian school in Purcellville, Va. “Not only is that wrong, it makes him unelectable. How are we going to grow our party?”                                         Donald Trump supporter Perry Hooper, Jr. is driving an RV across Alabama to drum up support for his candidate ahead of Super Tuesday.

Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump’s other main rival, chimed in on Twitter: “You’re better than this. We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.”     Mr. Cruz also attacked Mr. Trump for declining to release income tax records, saying on NBC that the real-estate developer had something to hide, possibly a connection to organized crime.     “There have been multiple media reports about Donald’s business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,” Mr. Cruz said. “Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported.”     Mr. Trump has said he wouldn’t release his tax records because he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Asked about Mr. Cruz’s mafia comments, Mr. Trump, through a spokeswoman, said, “Lying Ted Cruz is grasping at straws because he is so far down in the polls. He is a nervous wreck.’’                                                 GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz criticized Donald Trump for failing to release his income tax forms.

But it also highlighted the quandary Mr. Rubio faces.     The Florida senator is emerging as the favorite of the party’s elected leaders and top GOP activists, yet with the anti-Trump vote fractured, Mr. Rubio can’t seem to pull off a victory or deprive Mr. Trump of one.     Meanwhile, Mr. Trump—who won three of the last four contests—appears headed for a near-sweep in the states awarding delegates Tuesday. He gained an important endorsement Sunday from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a leader of the Tea Party movement and staunch foe of illegal immigration.     To slow down the New York billionaire, one or two of the three remaining top candidates must abandon their quest.                                          Going into Super Tuesday, Donald Trump is hoping his support base-- voters who don’t have a college degree--will bring him closer to the nomination. What are the long-term risks of relying so heavily on this demographic? WSJ’s Jason Bellini reports.

Mr. Cruz aims to win his home state of Texas on Tuesday, which could boost his delegate count; Mr. Rubio is fighting to take Florida on March 15, where the winner will pocket all the delegates.      The trouble is, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has embraced the same strategy with his state’s primary, also March 15, where the winner likewise will secure all the delegates.         More on Election 2016                If no one backs down, Mr. Trump can slip past them all—and may defeat a couple of them on their own turf. The outlook is putting major Republican donors, party leaders and elected officials in states ranging from panic to depression.     “A lot of Republicans are feeling resigned to the notion that Trump will be the nominee and then go down in flames in the general” election, said Al Hoffman, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before he quit the race. “It will be all over on March 15 when Trump wins big time in Florida.”     Mr. Rubio’s top allies are taking a one-day-at-a-time approach, while suggesting that Messrs. Cruz and Kasich should stand down.     “People who were supporting Cruz and Kasich are starting to switch their votes to Rubio because they see it’s a two-person race and they want a Republican to win the White House,” said Rep. Barbara Comstock, who represents the district that includes the college where Mr. Rubio spoke.     Mr. Rubio, who has taken to mocking Mr. Trump’s tweets, cast his decision to go negative as a last resort to prevent a “con artist” from taking over the Republican Party and conservative movement.     The Cuban-American senator noted that the GOP field includes another Hispanic, Mr. Cruz, and an African-American, Ben Carson, implicitly drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and disparaged Mexican immigrants.     “We are the party of diversity,” Mr. Rubio said. “We are going to grow this party and we are going to unify it.”     Mr. Rubio’s general-election-like argument came in the first of four appearances Sunday in a state that has swung back and forth between the two parties. Virginia voted for President Barack Obama twice and elected Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, but has backed Republican majorities in the state Legislature.     Jason Miyares, a Republican state lawmaker who co-heads Mr. Rubio’s campaign in the state, said he expects him to win support in northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads, especially from voters tied to the military and defense industry.     “Sen. Rubio is known as one of the biggest proponents of national defense, and these communities want someone who takes that role seriously,” Mr. Miyares said. “I find it hard to believe they will go for a reality TV star.”     A big part of Mr. Trump’s success has been his domination of free media through both television interviews and Twitter postings.      Mr. Trump also drew attention Sunday for re-tweeting a quote from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini: “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.”     Asked on NBC if he wanted to be associated with a fascist, Mr. Trump bragged about his unprecedented reach in the GOP field on social media.     “I want to be associated with interesting quotes,” said Mr. Trump, who has 6.4 million followers on Twitter. “Hey, it got your attention, didn’t it?’’     Voters backing Mr. Rubio are divided about his anti-Trump offensive. Lauren Stevens, a 17-year-old high school senior in Ashburn, Va., said she is excited to cast her first presidential vote for Mr. Rubio but that he shouldn’t “stoop to Trump’s level.” Vicky Quick, 48-year-old owner of a graphic design firm, said, “I think it’s about time he stood up and said something. Trump has changed the game, and he’s got to get in the ring and fight or Trump is going to trample him.”     The Rubio team isn’t the only one chafing at the refusal of other candidates to stand down. In a call with reporters Sunday, a top adviser to Mr. Kasich, John Weaver, said his candidate is unlikely to win Michigan, a Midwestern state the campaign had previously suggested would be friendly turf for the Ohio governor, because of the number of candidates still competing.     —Janet Hook contributed to this article.
