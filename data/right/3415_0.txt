President Donald Trump railed against special counsel Robert Mueller and the media Thursday morning, the one-year anniversary of his appointment. Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history – by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and “Haters,” but that’s the way it is! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2018  Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History…and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2018 May 17 marks the one-year anniversary of Mueller’s appointment as special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller and his team have indicted several Russians for interference in the election and have delved in the personal finances of former Trump campaign officials. It also appeared that the special counsel attempted investigate whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice at any point in his time in office.
