The militant group Islamic State rose to infamy in 2014 as the world’s most dangerous terrorist group. Its devastating blitz through eastern Syria and northern Iraq that began midyear reshaped the political landscape across the Middle East and remade alliances, turning the focus away from the Arab Spring and its aftermath. The radical group’s conquests threatened entire minority communities, displaced hundreds of thousands of people and prompted the third U.S. military intervention in Iraq in as many decades.                                                                                                                                                     The group, which grew out of the al Qaeda affiliate Islamic State in Iraq, gained control of a swath of territory. It changed its name to Islamic State and declared a caliphate ruled by its own strict interpretation of Islamic law.     Islamic State financed its operations with money looted from banks and with revenue from captured oil fields. It armed its fighters with military hardware seized from bases, driving U.S.-made tanks from Iraq across a porous border into Syria.               By August, Islamic State was commanding the world’s attention when it besieged thousands of members of the small Yazidi sect on a barren mountainside in northern Iraq, raising the specter of a genocide.     Spurred by the threat to the Yazidis, the U.S. began airstrikes in August on Islamic State targets in Iraq, backed by an international coalition. When the militants took control of the strategic Mosul Dam in early August, the U.S. was drawn more deeply into the crisis.                                                  A frame from a video released by Islamic State in August purports to show the killing of journalist James Foley by the militant group.          Uncredited/Associated Press                                                                                                             Islamic State responded to the airstrikes with a series of beheadings of Western hostages in Syria, beginning with the killing of American journalist James Foley in mid-August. The group released videos of the killings of two more Americans, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig, in the weeks that followed. A U.S.-led air campaign on Islamic State targets in Syria began in September, Washington’s first direct military intervention in the war there.     Alliances began to shift in the face of the Islamic State threat. The U.S. and Iran separately sent advisers to the semiautonomous Kurdish region in Iraq to help coordinate a strategy against the militants. Shiite Muslim Iran and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, bitter rivals for power and influence in the region, both feared the rise of the extremists and backed the same candidate to lead Iraq.     At the same time, the rise of Islamic State created tensions in some long-standing friendships. The U.S. and Turkey were at odds over support for a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting in the city of Kobani on the Turkish border. The U.S. ended up airdropping weapons and aid for the militia, which was viewed with suspicion by Turkey.     The airstrikes have hampered Islamic State’s advances, but progress has been limited by the lack of a solid ground force to capture and hold territory. With the vetting and training of allied ground forces moving slowly, Kurdish fighters in Syria and Iraq have stepped into the void.      Developments in the second half of the year left Kurds asserting more independence in northern Iraq, Sunni extremists entrenched in Sunni-majority areas of the country and the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and its military forces exerting only limited authority. As the year came to a close, the risks of Iraq splintering into several separate entities appeared greater than ever.     —Karen Leigh and Matt Bradley                                                 Top Senate Republicans come out of a leadership-election meeting on Nov. 13, after being unanimously re-elected.          Getty Images                                                                                                             Republicans Sweep Midterms, Gaining Senate Control Propelled by a wave of dissatisfaction with President         Barack Obama,    Republicans emerged from November’s midterm elections with a majority in the Senate and a firmer hold on the House, giving the party control of both chambers of Congress for the first time since 2006.          It was a substantial win: The GOP picked up nine Senate seats and will hold 54 seats in that chamber in the next Congress, to the Democrats’ 46. The Democrats’ Senate loss represented the biggest in the chamber that any president’s party had suffered since 1958, during Dwight Eisenhower’s second term.     In the House, the GOP will hold 247 seats, the largest majority the party has held since 1931.     But the full measure of the Republican gains—and the Democratic collapse—comes from looking down-ballot, where the GOP also made sweeping advances.     Republicans picked up 11 legislative chambers this year and now control 68 of the nation’s 98 partisan chambers on the state level, the highest number in the party’s history. In all, Democrats have lost more than 900 seats in state legislatures during Mr.         Obama’s    time in office.                                                                                                                                                     After the 2008 election, 28 of the nation’s governors were Democrats. Now, only 17 are. After the 2008 election, 31 state attorneys general were Democrats. Now, the party has 23.     The setbacks leave Democrats with a substantial political challenge, because state legislators and attorneys general form the bench of candidates that parties tend to draw on for governor and federal offices.     Republicans also come out of this year’s elections with the larger number of laboratories in which to test their party’s policy ideas. Some 23 states will have both a Republican governor and a GOP-controlled state legislature in 2015, while just seven states will be under similar Democratic control.     The elections also moved the GOP closer to a total takeover of the South. In January, Republicans will control 19 of 22 Senate seats from the South, and 101 of the 138 House seats.     The election outcome crystallized the challenge each party faces in the coming Congress. As they consider their deep losses, Democrats are debating whether and how to reshape the party’s economic message. Liberals have largely rallied behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her call for a focus on income inequality and efforts to rein in the financial-services sector and other interests. Centrist Democrats say the party can best draw voters by focusing foremost on plans to promote broad economic growth, with some fearing that an inequality message would alienate some voters.     Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to use the next two years to show they can pass legislation without the brinkmanship and drama that has become common in Congress, so voters have confidence in 2016 that the party can secure the White House.     One surprising facet of the elections: Spending on congressional races appears to have finally peaked, after years of expanding. The 2014 midterms cost roughly the same as—or, adjusted for inflation, somewhat less than—the 2010 congressional contests, according to tallies by two groups that track election spending.     —Rebecca Ballhaus     U.S. Economy Makes Comeback, at Last The U.S. economy began 2014 with a thud but ended it on a roll.     The economy will be remembered for the best hiring stretch since the late 1990s boom, record auto sales and a swift plunge in gasoline prices. All three helped soften a year marred by still-meager wage gains and a slowdown in home sales.     Employers added 2.7 million jobs over the past year and the country is on track to post its best year of hiring since 1999. Job openings are running near a 13-year high. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8% in November from 7% a year earlier.                                                  Last-minute Christmas shoppers hit the stores in Chicago on Christmas Eve. Businesses, consumers and investors showed renewed vigor in late 2014.          Associated Press                                                                                                             The number of Americans working finally surpassed its prerecession high, though the number of full-time workers is still around two million shy of the 2007 peak.     The big question now is when will more Americans get a raise. Income gains have been weak, which helps explain why so many Americans remain unsatisfied with an economy that has posted steady gains in output, hiring and corporate profits.     Wage growth would help narrow an income gap that has risen amid big rises in stock prices and smaller upticks in home values, both of which benefit wealthier households. Between 2010 and 2013, median incomes rose for only the wealthiest 10% of households, according to a Federal Reserve survey.     —Nick Timiraos     Oil Prices Crater Amid Glut of Shale                                                 Pump jacks near Bakersfield, Calif., in October. Crude prices have fallen sharply as a flood of crude from U.S. shale disrupted the market.

The price drop came on the heels of several years of relative calm in world-wide crude markets, where the rising output in America was balanced by growing oil demand around the globe.

U.S. oil prices began the year above $90 a barrel and rose slowly through the spring; the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the oil benchmark in the U.S., peaked at $107 in June. At about the same time, the European benchmark peaked at $115 a barrel.     Then prices began to fall. While the supply was robust, the global thirst for crude oil slackened. Amid cooling prices and weakening demand, U.S. shale drillers kept charging ahead. The U.S.’s big three oil fields began the year pumping 3.67 million barrels a day. By year’s end, it was 4.69 million barrels a day and rising, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. American oil displaced imports, putting pressure on countries like Nigeria and Colombia that had traditionally sold a lot of their oil to American refineries.     Over the summer, two things happened that reshaped the energy picture. The U.S. was beginning to export a certain kind of unrefined oil, a crack in an export ban on crude that dates back to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. While the number of barrels involved was small, the decision jolted the market. A week after the U.S. move, Libya reopened two large oil-export terminals, adding new crude supplies.     Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia met in November to discuss cutting production. Russia balked. Two days after the meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to cut either. Prices fell further, dropping into the mid-$50s range for U.S. crude. European crude oil briefly dropped below $60 a barrel, then edged back up to about $62 a barrel. Through late December, American oil output continued to grow.     The drop in crude prices was a boon to drivers, who filled up their tanks with gasoline bought at the lowest prices in five years. The economies of major crude producers, such as Russia, were walloped.     —Russell Gold     Ukraine Explodes Into Military Conflict The political tug of war over Ukraine exploded into a military conflict that has killed thousands of people, including 298 aboard a commercial jetliner shot down in rebel territory. Relations between Russia and the West sank to a post-Cold War low as economic sanctions piled up.     The conflict grew out of street protests against Ukraine President         Viktor Yanukovych’s    pivot toward Russia. The president fled in February; within a month, Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.     The U.S., European Union and others denounced Russia’s move as an illegal land grab and responded with asset freezes, travel bans and diplomatic snubs. But the conflict spread to Ukraine’s east, an industrial, predominantly Russian-speaking region. Separatist militias took form, declaring “people’s republics” and sometimes humiliating poorly equipped Ukrainian soldiers.     In May, confectionery tycoon Petro Poroshenko was elected president, promising to rout the rebels and turn Ukraine back toward Europe. He began an all-out military operation in July, recapturing lost ground with airstrikes and heavy artillery.     The West hit Russia’s financial, defense and energy sectors with sanctions days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine on July 17. In August, advancing government forces were sent reeling by an influx of Russian armor and troops.

Days later, Ukraine agreed to delay part of a trade deal with Europe opposed by Moscow by more than a year. Hundreds of deaths have been recorded since the Sept. 5 truce, bringing the total to more than 4,300, according to the U.N.     Russia’s economy and currency were hit hard by the crisis, prompting its central bank to raise its key interest rate to 17% in December in a bid to stem the ruble’s drop. The government warned the country would slip into recession next year.      —Paul Geitner     Ebola Becomes a Global Health Crisis The Ebola virus ravaged West Africa, leaving more than 7,500 people dead, raising global concerns and taking a toll on the continent’s burgeoning economies.     The outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic disease devastated Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, developing nations already burdened by civil unrest and crushing poverty. Poor health infrastructure and planning, the international community’s slow initial response, local resistance to outside assistance and corruptionin the early stages exacerbated the crisis.     Aid organizations warned that amassing a medical workforce would be a huge challenge. Still, nations such as Nigeria acted quickly and were able to contain the virus, while others showed they have built strong defenses to cut off potential outbreaks.

A nursing aide in Spain who contracted the first case outside Africa recovered, but authorities put down her family’s dog amid an outcry.     Two missionaries who were evacuated to the U.S. from Liberia survived the disease, but a Liberian man who flew to the U.S. died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital, prompting concern about the country’s readiness in the event the disease spread. Later, a surgeon who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone died in Nebraska.     The U.S. sent the military to West Africa, while the Obama administration grappled with imposing travel bans and lobbied Congress for emergency funds to fight the virus.     The cases of a doctor who recovered in New York and a nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey, then defied such restrictions, raised public consciousness in the U.S. Heavy U.S. demand for protective gear sparked shortages in Africa.     The lack of a proven drug or vaccine stymied efforts to quell the outbreak, but vaccine makers moved up clinical trials. In West Africa, researchers are studying a more accessible product: the blood of survivors.     —Aaron Jaffe     Tentative Thaw in U.S.-Cuba Relations President Barack Obama, acting without Congress, in December said he would move to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than five decades of open antagonism.     Mr. Obama made a surprise announcement that the U.S. would normalize relations with the ruling communist regime for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president.     In addition to saying it would establish an embassy in Havana, the Obama administration said it would allow U.S. financial institutions to do business in Cuba, permit greater trade and increase the amount of money that Americans can send to relatives on the island.

The U.S. trade embargo remains in place, as it can be rescinded only by Congress. Mr. Obama’s new direction was sharply opposed by critics who said the Cuban regime shouldn’t be rewarded or legitimized due to its record on human rights and democracy.     “This is a reward that a totalitarian regime does not deserve, and this announcement only perpetuates the Castro regime’s decades of repression,” said Sen.         Robert Menendez,    a New Jersey Democrat and departing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.      —Byron Tau     Big Banks Face Tough Regulatory Oversight When six banks agreed to pay a whopping $4.3 billion in November on charges they had manipulated foreign-exchange rates, the settlements had elements of what have come to be the hallmarks of bank regulation this year. Several regulators—in this case from the U.S., U.K. and Switzerland—cooperated in the action; the fines were very big; and the orders included quotes from embarrassing emails in which traders discussed their actions in colorful detail.     But in one of the more significant signs of the tough approach regulators took in many instances, the banks were forced to provide a lot more than penalty money. They had to agree to intrusive and highly detailed instructions on what they needed to do to remedy the behaviors. And these weren’t one-off changes. There is a continuing role for regulators to monitor the banks and ensure new systems are put in place to prevent recurrences. The banks will be watched carefully for any slips.                                                 Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York state’s Department of Financial Services, said regulators now want to remove people involved in violations and install monitors to continue to probe inside the banks.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Regulators don’t expect that oversight to let up. Fines will be important, but more important will be measures intended to correct shortcomings in banking culture.              Benjamin Lawsky,    superintendent of New York state’s Department of Financial Services, said regulators now want to remove people involved in violations and install monitors to continue to probe inside the banks. “It’s often not huge fines that get you where you want to get,” he said.      The banking industry hasn’t taken to the enforcement actions lying down, complaining of overly severe penalties. While banks have agreed to the actions in the individual cases, they have argued that the penalties are often higher than justified by the infractions.     —James Sterngold     Ferguson Puts Police Tactics in Spotlight The shooting death of an 18-year-old unarmed black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August set off peaceful demonstrations that eventually turned into nights of riots in the St. Louis suburb.     The incident quickly morphed into a national debate over protests of alleged mistreatment of African-Americans by police in cities including New York and Cleveland, as well as a criminal-justice system that has often declined to indict the officers involved. President Barack Obama has said he supported peaceful protests and authorized a federal investigation into the Ferguson police department and Michael Brown’s death.                                                 Protesters march in Ferguson, Mo., as lightning flashes in the distance in August, after the police killing of Michael Brown.          Associated Press                                                                                                             In Ferguson, the protests reignited in late November with more riots after a grand jury declined to indict the officer involved in the shooting. In early December, a Staten Island grand jury cleared a New York City police officer in the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed man who died after allegedly being held in a chokehold during his arrest earlier this year.     The story took another violent turn just before Christmas, when two New York City officers were gunned down by a lone assailant who had left posts on social media saying he was inspired to retaliate against police after the deaths of Messrs. Brown and Garner.     “We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown,” the Rev.         Al Sharpton,    a civil-rights activist, said after the two officers’ deaths.      But some law-enforcement officials and their supporters turned against politicians they accused of recklessly supporting protesters.     “We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,” former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told Fox News in late December.     —Matthew Dolan                                                 James Franco, left, and Seth Rogen in a scene from ‘The Interview.’          Associated Press                                                                                                                      Sony’s    Hacking Rings Alarm Bells for Firms The cyberattack that hit Sony Pictures Entertainment in late November began as a salacious peek at the inner workings of Hollywood, as hackers released the emails of top executives, including Co-Chairman         Amy Pascal    and Chief Executive Michael Lynton     The hackers’ purported motive: retaliation against the studio for “The Interview,” a comedy film about two television journalists tasked with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      But the incident quickly escalated into an international controversy, after hackers threatened violence against theaters that played the film, and U.S. officials concluded that North Korea was behind the broad cyberattack on the company. The Sony Corp. studio made an 11th-hour decision to cancel the movie’s Dec. 25 release.     That move was met with considerable backlash in Hollywood and Washington, where President Barack Obama called the decision a mistake. Then, two days before Christmas, Sony announced it would release the film as part of a limited theatrical run, with a simultaneous video-on-demand offering. Possibly as a result of the controversy, crowds flocked to see it in theaters, ringing up just over $1 million in ticket sales on the first day. Online, the movie was rented or bought more than two million times in its first four days, generating more than $15 million in gross revenue.     Sony is still working to figure out when and how to release the film internationally; now it is available only in the U.S. In Hollywood, the scandal had an immediate chilling effect on other projects in development pertaining to North Korea. More broadly, the incident raised fresh concerns that other companies’ systems are vulnerable to malicious hacking.     —Erich Schwartzel     Inversions Help Firms Lower Their Tax Bills Sometimes it pays to be early. That was the case in the 2014, when companies rushed to strike deals that would allow them to move overseas and lower their taxes—often dramatically so. A U.S. government crackdown on so-called inversions turned away some latecomers. But several early adopters came in under the wire and gained a potential longer-term edge over their rivals in the process.     Many of those early birds were health-care companies looking to shield overseas cash from U.S. tax rates. Over half of the more-than-$648 billion of the health-care deals announced (although not necessarily completed) in 2014 were inversions, according to data provider Dealogic.                                                 The Treasury Department announced new rules that made inversions less lucrative.

Concerns raised about the potential deal were among the factors that spurred the Obama administration to begin examining ways to curb the practice, a senior administration official said earlier in the year.     The Treasury Department stepped in a few weeks later, announcing new rules that made the deals less lucrative for the companies doing them. The rules, announced Sept. 22, had a chilling effect on deals that hadn’t closed. The biggest known casualty:         AbbVie Inc.’s    $54 billion deal to buy Shire PLC, which was called off in October.     —Dana Mattioli     Israel, Hamas Clash in Deadly Conflict Six weeks after the breakdown of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Israel and the Islamist group Hamas fought their third and deadliest war in five years.     The sparks came from the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank on June 12 and the retaliatory killing of a Palestinian teen on July 2, amid a rise in rocket fire into Israel from militants in the Gaza Strip.      Israel launched an air campaign against rocket-launch sites and other Hamas targets in the enclave, including extensive Palestinian tunnels under the border, and sent in ground troops. Early efforts at diplomacy yielded short pauses in fighting, but little more.                                                 Israeli soldiers fire toward the Gaza strip in July. Israel said it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties, but some attacks took a heavy toll.          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             Israel said it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties, but some attacks took a heavy toll. Palestinian deaths in the conflict were estimated at more than 2,100, and Israel reported the deaths of about 70 people.     While Israel drew international condemnation for the severity of destruction it caused, Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    was blasted at home for not going far enough.     Among Palestinians, the conflict hurt the reputation of the moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, at the expense of Hamas’s political chief, Khaled Meshaal, who was seen as standing up to Israel.     An Aug. 26 Egypt-brokered cease-fire restored the status quo, with both sides claiming victory after the 50-day war. The calm was broken in late December, when a rocket and sniper fire from Gaza spurred Israeli airstrikes.      —Robert P. Walzer     Obama Takes Action on Illegal Immigrants A surge in illegal entries of unaccompanied children and families into the U.S. spawned a political crisis that undermined bilateral support for a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s immigration system.      Ultimately, President Barack Obama decided to use his executive powers to shield from deportation as many as five million of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., setting the stage for a protracted battle over the issue next year.                                                  The crowd cheers as President Barack Obama discusses his immigration move in Las Vegas in November.          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             Nearly 69,000 unaccompanied children, mainly from Central America, streamed across the southwest border in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, a 77% increase from 2013. Roughly as many migrants, typically mothers and children, came in family units, a 360% jump over the previous year. The influx peaked over the summer, then dropped sharply in recent months.     Many migrants said they were fleeing violence and have requested asylum. After being apprehended at the border, most minors were processed by U.S. authorities and released to relatives or friends while they await deportation proceedings. Many families remain in detention near the border. Due to a shortage of space, some of them were allowed to join relatives in the U.S. while their removal cases unfold in immigration court.     The Obama administration’s decision to expedite their deportation cases angered immigrant advocates. At the same time, the surge hardened the positions of Republicans who said it underscored the need to bolster border security before Congress passes laws to legalize undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.     Waiting until after November’s midterm elections, Mr. Obama announced executive action to temporarily protect millions of immigrants from deportation and give them work authorization. He had earlier promised to tackle immigration unilaterally in the absence of congressional action. Republicans said the unilateral action exceeded the president’s legal authority and vowed to block it. Top leaders in some 20 states have sued him over the plan but experts differ on whether they have a case, given that immigration is a federal issue.      —Miriam Jordan      GM Is Dogged by Recalls, Probes          Mary Barra    began her first year running         General Motors Co.    with the wind at her back. Armed with a fortress balance sheet and North American margins on a positive swing, she was among President Barack Obama’s guests at the State of the Union in January.                                                 Mary Barra, chief executive of General Motors, testifies at a House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing in June.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Then the auto maker ran into one of the biggest challenges in its 106-year-history, forcing Ms. Barra, 53 years old, to return to Washington several times to explain to lawmakers and regulators why it was so slow in addressing the faulty ignition switches installed in vehicles for a decade. The safety crisis led to millions of recalls and will cost the Detroit auto giant billions of dollars to resolve.      GM’s management team moved quickly to identify blame and repair affected vehicles—primarily small cars like the Chevrolet Cobalt. But the incident raised fresh questions about a company that had just a few years earlier filed for bankruptcy protection and relied on a government bailout to regain viability.     Among the moves Ms. Barra made: appointing Chicago attorney         Anton Valukas.    Interviewing hundreds of witnesses, he compiled a 315-page report documenting a decadelong odyssey during which GM showed a lack of urgency in addressing its ignition-switch problems. GM also appointed attorney         Kenneth Feinberg    as the independent custodian of a compensation fund.      GM is subject to a Justice Department investigation that analysts estimate could end with a fine of at least $2 billion. The auto maker also faces class-action lawsuits.     Ms. Barra is trying to move on, focusing on the company’s financial goals and attempts to fix GM Europe, revive Cadillac and mend relations with suppliers. The industry, however, continues to confront safety questions, mostly related to a       Takata Corp.    air-bag recall involving about 10 auto makers and more than 13 million cars and trucks globally.

Stoll                                                 University students in China hold a candlelight vigil for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March.          Associated Press                                                                                                             Malaysia Airlines Plane Disappears On the night of March 8, Malaysia Airlines flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. More than nine months later, their fate remains a mystery.     A frantic search for the         Boeing    777 began in the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the plane fell off radar screens about an hour into the flight to Beijing. Days later, after investigators had analyzed satellite transmissions, the search expanded by thousands of miles, in an air and sea operation of unprecedented scale.     Investigators believe the plane was deliberately diverted by someone with deep technical knowledge of the aircraft. No suspects or suspected motives have emerged.     As investigators continued to refine their analysis of the so-called digital handshakes between the plane and an       Inmarsat    PLC satellite, they narrowed the search area to a vast stretch of sea far off the coast of western Australia, where they suspect the plane crashed after running out of fuel.     Repeated scans of the water’s surface and seabed have yielded nothing. It is a void that haunts the loved ones of the passengers and crew, many of whom are skeptical of the official investigation and feel unable to fully mourn their losses.      In October, a rebooted deep-sea search began, raising hopes for some resolution to one of the most confounding tragedies in the history of aviation. Australian Prime Minister         Tony Abbott    has said his government, which is overseeing the search, won’t rest until it has done everything it can to find the jetliner.     —Allison Morrow     Iran Spreads Influence in Middle East The overlap of interests between Iran’s nuclear negotiations with world powers and cooperation on wider issues of concern in the Middle East—such as battling extremist group Islamic State—came into relief in 2014.     Even if all sides publicly refute that any connection exists, they acknowledge in private that a solution on the first could pave the way for cooperation on the second.     As the year drew to a close, Iran’s economy was knocked off kilter just as it was beginning to recover—slammed by a double blow from the sharp drop in oil prices and failure to reach a comprehensive agreement with six global powers on curbing the country’s nuclear activities.                                                 Under President Hasan Rouhani, Iran managed to spread its sway around the region in 2014.          Vahid Salemi/Associated Press                                                                                                             Still, Shiite Iran managed to spread its sway around the region in 2014. It consolidated its influence over Shiite-majority Iraq with the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011.      Iranian support and guidance, as well as legions of Iranian-alllied Shiite Hezbollah fighters, played a decisive role in bolstering the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah, which Iran midwifed and has nurtured for decades, has entrenched itself as Lebanon’s most powerful political player.     And an Iranian-backed Shiite minority group in Yemen, the Houthis, have recently swept into the capital, San’a, and established themselves as a major force in that trouble-plagued country.     —Bill Spindle     Veterans Department Is Roiled by Scandal Wrongdoing, resignations and a push for an overhaul marked the past year for the Department of Veterans Affairs.     In April, whistleblower allegations of wrongdoing by employees responsible for appointment scheduling at a VA hospital in Phoenix led to high-profile congressional hearings. Soon, investigators from both the department and other federal agencies documented systemic problems across the nation.      These problems included employees tampering with official records to hide long wait times for veterans seeking health-care appointments and some managers punishing whistleblowers who tried to highlight problems. Excessive wait times even contributed to some deaths, according to the VA’s own internal watchdog.                                                 Eric Shinseki was forced to resign as secretary of veterans affairs after a scandal at the agency.          Getty Images                                                                                                             By the end of May, a number of top VA officials had resigned, including Secretary         Eric Shinseki.    By July, Congress had approved a more-than $16 billion emergency funding package and confirmed         Robert McDonald,    the former CEO of         Procter & Gamble Co.    , to bring reform to the embattled agency.     Mr. McDonald cut the backlog of veterans waiting for care, pushed for firings of senior executives and was warmly received by many veterans advocacy groups and lawmakers.     By December, however, expensive debacles in billion-dollar construction projects and remaining backlogs for care and compensation showed that overhauling the agency—with a budget of more than $150 billion—won’t be accomplished in a matter of a few months.     —Ben Kesling     Turkey’s Leader Erdogan Asserts His Power For Turkey, 2014 was marked by volatility, foreign-policy friction and the political triumph of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose consolidation of power divided the nation and alarmed Western allies.                                                 Recep Tayyip Erdogan, addressing the members of his party in August, moved from prime minister to president.          Associated Press                                                                                                             The year began with Mr. Erdogan, then prime minister, confronting one of the gravest threats to him in his nearly 12 years as a Turkish leader. He broke ranks with conservative allies and faced a sprawling corruption scandal that ensnared dozens of his allies.     Amid a series of allegations of government graft, Turkey’s currency tumbled, forcing the central bank into an emergency rate increase.     Mr. Erdogan overcome the allegations and clinched the presidency in August, after casting his former allies as terrorist coup-plotters, briefly blocking YouTube and Twitter, and cracking down on street protests. Through the year he tightened his grip with changes to the justice system, media and security services.

Amid stern rebukes from Western capitals, Mr. Erdogan told his detractors to “mind their own business.”     —Joe Parkinson     Chinese Firm Alibaba’s IPO Is Biggest in History        Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.    set a new bar for initial public offerings with its $25 billion U.S. listing on Sept. 18. The biggest IPO in history gave the Chinese e-commerce company a market value bigger than U.S. giant         Amazon.com Inc.         The deal also delivered a 38% first-day trading gain for investors who bought in, and generated some $300 million for its underwriters. Many big hedge funds, including Paulson & Co., said that gains on the deal helped them turn a volatile quarter into a strong one.      With Alibaba’s proceeds, the U.S. market saw more money raised by IPOs than in any year since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, according to Dealogic. Increased investor interest in China’s Internet economy helped others list in the U.S. this year, including online shopping rival         JD.com Inc.,    which raised $2 billion in a New York listing, and Chinese mobile-chat app makers         Weibo Corp.    and Momo Inc., who both count Alibaba as a strategic investor.     Alibaba says it has more than 275 million active buyers in its Chinese retail sites—or roughly 90% of the country’s online shoppers—who generated some $300 billion in transactions. Executive Chairman         Jack Ma,    who founded the firm in 1999, attracted global media attention as he toured to meet investors. The IPO solidified his position as China’s richest man. (Take a look back at the big stories in business.)     —Telis Demos     U.S. Health Law Smoother, but Hurdles Remain The Affordable Care Act recovered from its initial insurance-enrollment stumbles, but faced fresh challenges.     About 6.4 million people selected a plan or were automatically re-enrolled on HealthCare.gov between Nov. 15 and Dec. 19, federal officials said. The site hasn’t experienced the widespread crashes that hobbled the law’s first year of enrollment.      The U.S. had 10.6 million fewer uninsured people in September than a year earlier—a drop of 30%, according to the Urban Institute. But problems still dogged the law this year.     In June, the Obama administration lost a Supreme Court challenge to the law’s requirement that health plans cover contraception. By November, the high court had agreed to hear another case against the law, this one focused on whether residents of states that use the federal insurance exchange are entitled to insurance tax credits. At stake are subsidies that make plans cheaper for millions of consumers, and are critical to making the law work.     The law’s insurance enrollment portal for small businesses got off to a slow start this fall. A hacker broke into HealthCare.gov in July and uploaded malicious software on the site.              Kathleen Sebelius,    the Health and Human Services secretary who championed the law and later took heat for its messy implementation, left the administration in June. Her successor,         Sylvia Mathews Burwell,    started the job with stronger support from Congress and quickly addressed mistakes, such as when her office overstated the number of people who had paid-up coverage under the law.      Despite this year’s relatively smooth enrollment season, the administration has lowered projections for how many people it expects to sign up for private coverage in 2015—anticipating 9.9 million, compared with 13 million earlier projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.     —Stephanie Armour      Big Asian Economies Face Uncertainty                                                 Passersby are reflected on an electronic stock quote board outside a brokerage in Tokyo.          Reuters                                                                                                             China is on track to miss its 2014 annual growth target of 7.5%, the most dramatic example of Asian countries—including Japan, India and Indonesia—where leaders are trying to find their footing in the face of economic headwinds.     Beijing has been attempting to wean the world’s second-largest economy off risky credit, let some air out of a property bubble without causing a pop, and steer the nation toward an era of lower and more sustainable growth. Chinese authorities have been cautious, but investors are jittery. The People’s Bank of China in November cut interest rates for the first time in two years in an effort to bolster growth amid a fast slowdown in housing sales. A modest tightening in December to lending rules sparked the biggest daily loss in five years on Shanghai’s stock market.     Japan, meanwhile, doubled down on a bid to end years of falling prices and subpar growth. In October, the Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchases by trillions of yen. But Japan also is the most indebted developed nation. That has forced it to raise taxes alongside stimulus, tipping the nation into recession in the third quarter.     The BOJ forecasts the economy will grow an anemic 0.5% in the fiscal year ending in March, but that activity will pick up the following year.     There was some hope in 2014 around India and Indonesia, two large economies that both got new leaders this year. Business-friendly changes in both places could attract investment. Both nations in 2014 maintained a tight monetary policy, shoring up their defenses for such an event, as well as battling inflation.     Asia’s largest economies end the year with a great deal of uncertainty over the horizon.      —Tom Wright     Bond Sales Ramp Up, Helped by Mergers Another year, another record. Companies with investment-grade credit ratings, meaning triple-B-minus or above, sold more than $1.18 trillion in new bonds and similar securities in the U.S. in 2014, the highest on record and the third year in a row a record was set, according to data provider Dealogic. In 2013, these companies sold $1.11 trillion, and in 2012, they sold $1.05 trillion.     This year’s deals included a $17 billion sale from         Medtronic Inc.,    the largest corporate-bond sale of the year and tied for the second-biggest on record, according to Dealogic. There were also some high-profile newcomers: Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. sold $8 billion in its debut offering.                                                 Employees work on a stent graft production line at a Medtronic plant in Mexico.          Bloomberg News                                                                                                             Investors say the deluge of deals was driven in part by falling U.S. Treasury yields, to which corporate bonds are pegged, lowering interest costs for companies. Firms also sought financing in the bond market to pay for an uptick in mergers and acquisitions. Demand from fund managers was brisk for many bond sales. Buyers say they were attracted to the debt because it offered more yield than benchmark Treasurys, and because the outlook for many of these firms is favorable as the U.S. economy improves.     “We’re very much in a yield-starved world,” said         Fred Azar,    director of fixed-income business management at Northern Trust Asset Management, which oversees $923 billion. “Investors are searching for yield, and there’s very few spots to get that outside of the U.S. corporate market.”     —Mike Cherney     Several States Raise Minimum Wages The push to raise the minimum wage turned from a campaign pitch with lukewarm backing on Capitol Hill to a movement propelled by a groundswell of support at the state and local levels. A quarter of U.S. states enacted minimum-wage increases during the year, but the chance of a federal increase appears more remote today than a year ago.      In January’s State of the Union address, President Barack Obama issued a call to lift the federal pay floor to $10.10 an hour from $7.25, a key plank in his proposal to address economic inequality. The effort gained little traction in Congress. The $10.10 level failed to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate in the spring and House Republican leaders opposed the idea.                                                  Boxes containing roughly 135,000 petitions calling for raising the Nebraska minimum wage.          Nebraska Secretary of State handout/Associated Press                                                                                                             Democrats had sought to make inequality—and Republicans’ opposition to an increase—a leading issue in the midterm elections in November. The strategy didn’t work. Republicans won control of the Senate, dimming supporters’ hopes that a national increase could be reconsidered.     In four states—Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota—voters elected GOP candidates at the top of the ticket and approved an increase to the state minimum wage. Ten state legislatures backed increases in 2014, including a jump to $11 an hour from $8 in Massachusetts, and a $1 increase from the federal standard in Delaware. Starting next year, 29 states will have pay floors above the federal level, including 15 with future increases tied to inflation.     —Eric Morath     Investors Pile Into Dollar Amid Rebound The dollar rose against every developed-market currency in 2014. Investors piled into the greenback this year, expecting stronger U.S. economic data would persuade the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying program and raise interest rates. Higher U.S. interest rates would lure yield-hungry investors to the dollar and away from the currencies of countries with lower rates.     Investors also predicted central banks in Japan and the eurozone would ease monetary policy in their efforts to boost growth and ward off low inflation, which would weaken their currencies. The WSJ Dollar Index, which compares the greenback against a basket of the most widely traded currencies, rose 12.5%, notching its best gain since 2005 and second best on record.     But the U.S. economy took far longer than expected to report consistently strong numbers, which pushed back market expectations for a Fed rate hike. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, meanwhile, waited until the summer and fall, respectively, to take substantial measures to ease policy.                                                 People walk past a sign advertising currency exchange rates in Moscow.          Associated Press                                                                                                             By the third quarter, the diverging paths for economic growth and monetary policy between the U.S. and the eurozone and Japan gained momentum, encouraging investors to ramp up their bets on a stronger dollar against the yen and euro. Through Monday, the dollar has gained 13.1% against the common currency, and 14.6% versus the yen.     Meanwhile, emerging-market currencies posted their worst year since 2008. Currencies from Russia to Mexico to Malaysia all dropped against the dollar this year, pressured by falling oil prices, a surging greenback and slowing economic growth in several emerging markets.         MSCI Inc.’s    index of emerging-market currencies fell more than 4% this year, its worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis and the second-worst performance since the index’s inception in 1997.     The plunge in oil prices since June has hurt the currencies of oil-exporting countries including Mexico, Colombia and Nigeria—but especially Russia, where the ruble has lost half its value against the dollar this year.     The ruble’s turmoil in mid-December triggered a broad selloff in emerging-market currencies. The prospect of the Federal Reserve’s first rate increase next year is also weighing on emerging-market currencies, as higher rates in the U.S. will make the rates in developing countries less attractive by comparison.     —James Ramage     NFL Forced to Tackle Domestic Violence The National Football League found itself in an embarrassing scandal when new video emerged of then-Baltimore Ravens running back         Ray Rice    hitting his now-wife, Janay, in at Atlantic City casino elevator, raising fresh questions about the NFL’s investigation and handling of the case.                                                  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell arrives to address the media during a news conference in September.          European Pressphoto Agency                                                                                                             After the February incident, Mr. Rice was suspended for two games, but once media website TMZ obtained more graphic footage in September, he was cut from his team and suspended indefinitely by the league. A media firestorm erupted, focused on NFL Commissioner         Roger Goodell,    who gave the initial punishment. Weeks of controversy ensued—Mr. Goodell apologized, admitted his mistakes and promised changes. He denied seeing the second tape before it was made public, but launched a probe into the handling of the evidence, led by former FBI Director         Robert Mueller    —a report that hasn’t yet been released.     Sponsors including       Anheuser-Busch InBev    said they were concerned with the NFL’s actions, but none pulled out of the league, which is seen as one of the most popular entities any company could strike a deal with. Once the NFL season started to heat up, the Rice case took a back seat to the games, but it wasn’t over yet.      In November, Mr. Rice’s appeal of the indefinite suspension was overturned by an arbitrator, who found the second punishment “arbitrary.” The appeal victory was a public-relations hit for the league, but didn’t mean much for Mr. Rice: no NFL team signed him after the decision, and he remains an NFL free agent. Eventually, the league created a new conduct policy, unveiled in December, to attempt to avoid similar scandals.     —Kevin Clark     Pushback on Surgical Tool Linked to Cancer At the start of the year, few people outside medicine had heard of a laparoscopic power morcellator, a surgical device that helps gynecologists perform minimally invasive hysterectomies by cutting tissue into small pieces.      By year’s end, news of the device’s risks, reported in a series of articles in The Wall Street Journal, had roiled the field. Major manufacturer         Johnson & Johnson    pulled the tools from shelves, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned against their use for most women, and hundreds of hospitals banned procedures with morcellators. The concern: Morcellators could dice up and spread hidden uterine cancer in women undergoing surgery for benign and common growths called fibroids. The cancer can’t be reliably detected before surgery, and the morcellator could worsen a woman’s chances for survival.                                                  Close-ups of an earlier, outlawed model of a morcellator.          Dustin Chambers for The Wall Street Journal                                                                                                             The morcellator debate built steadily all year. In January, a month after the Journal first highlighted the issue, the British medical journal Lancet published an editorial criticizing the way morcellators and other medical devices are approved and marketed. In February, Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia became the first to announce a prohibition on using morcellators in the open, unprotected abdomen. The same month, the FDA publicly acknowledged it was concerned about the risk of spreading cancer.     In April, the FDA said it discouraged morcellation but met resistance from gynecologists, who said abandoning the devices would expose women to risks from open surgery. On Nov. 24, the FDA called for a “black-box” warning, saying power morcellators shouldn’t be used on “the vast majority of women.”      —Jon Kamp     Corrections & Amplifications     The GOP holds 247 seats in the House, the largest majority Republicans have held since 1931. A previous version of this article incorrectly said the GOP’s House majority was the largest either party has held since 1931. (Jan. 11, 2015)     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
