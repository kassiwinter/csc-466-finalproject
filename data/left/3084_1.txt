Obama spoke out on Twitter, saying that he stands with the families and survivors. But he suggested that grieving isn't enough. "May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst," he said.   We grieve with all the families in Sutherland Springs harmed by this act of hatred, and we’ll stand with the survivors as they recover...— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 6, 2017    May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 6, 2017  Biden issued a similar statement on his Twitter account. He offered prayers for the community, and added, "These tragedies aren't inevitable. Don't let hopelessness win today. We must persist in our efforts to prevent gun violence."

"This isn't a guns situation, we could go into it but it's a little soon to go into it. Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it would've been – as bad as it was – it would've been much worse. But, this is a mental health problem at the highest level."The shooting comes just over a month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas which left 58 people dead -- the deadliest such incident in U.S. history.Obama and Biden pushed Congress to take legislative action to further prevent gun violence, but proposals to tighten gun laws have either failed or haven't come up for a vote at all.
