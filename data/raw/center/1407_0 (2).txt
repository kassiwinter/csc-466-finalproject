                                                  Speaking at the Global Health Security Agenda Summit in Washington, D.C., on Friday, President Barack Obama stressed the importance of an international response to the Ebola virus outbreak.

"Each time, the world scrambles to coordinate a response," Mr. Obama said at the Global Health Security Summit in Washington, D.C. "Each time, it's been harder than it should be to share information and to contain the outbreak. As a result, diseases have spread faster and farther than they should have, which means lives are lost that could have been saved."

The World Health Organization this week said the number of confirmed Ebola cases, as of Sept. 21, had reached 6,263, including 2,917 deaths. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the hardest-hit nations.               The agency has warned that the number of cases could grow exponentially—with more than 20,000 infected by early November—unless new measures are adopted to counter the virus.     "We have to change our mind-sets and start thinking about biological threats as the security threats that they are," Mr. Obama said. "We've got to make sure we never see a tragedy on this scale again, and we have to make sure we're not caught flat-footed."
