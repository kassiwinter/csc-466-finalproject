Census data unveiled on Monday revealed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2020, was 331.5 million, an increase of only 7.4% from 2010.

Slowed population growth is a trend dating back 30 years. From 1990-2000, the population increased by 13.2%, but from 2000-2010 that number dipped to 9.7%.      States with the highest increase include Utah, which saw 18.4% growth; Texas, with 15.9% growth; North Dakota, with 15.7% growth; and Washington and Florida, tied at 14.6% growth.       Three states saw their population drop during the last decade — West Virginia’s population shrunk by 3.2%, Mississippi’s by 0.2%, and Illinois's by 0.1%. But, those pale in comparison to Puerto Rico, a territory whose population decreased by 11.8% over the last 10 years.
