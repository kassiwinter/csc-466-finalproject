                 | April 18, 2021 03:40 PM                Over half of all adults in the United States have received at least one vaccine dose.       A total of 50.4% of U.S. residents above the age of 18 have received at least one inoculation, equating to 129,988,985 people, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 32.5% of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated.             Eighty-one percent of the nation's seniors who are over 65 have gotten at least one dose, which represents 44,328,500 people, and more than 65% of those 65 or older are fully vaccinated against the virus.      DESANTIS SPURNS CDC ADVICE, SAYS VACCINES ARE EFFECTIVE AND 'YOU'RE IMMUNE, AND SO, ACT IMMUNE'      The milestone comes despite the recent halting of the Johnson & Johnson inoculation earlier in the week after at least eight people were diagnosed with "a rare and severe type of blood clot." The single-shot vaccine makes up roughly 5% of the U.S. inventory that is mostly dominated by two-shot injections from Pfizer and Moderna.       "CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance," the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC wrote in a joint statement on Tuesday. "FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution."      On Sunday, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, said he expects medical advisers to resume Johnson & Johnson inoculations in some form by Friday.      "Well, I don't know if there have been through the cases, but we will know that by Friday, and I would be very surprised if we don't have a resumption in some form by Friday," the medical authority told Margaret Brennan on a segment of CBS's Face the Nation. "A decision almost certainly will be made by Friday."

The U.S. has experienced a 5% uptick in coronavirus cases in the last two weeks with a 12% decline in deaths and a 9% increase in hospitalizations, according to the New York Times.
