However, this will not be the case for members of CNN's news team this year. Two of the network's current anchors, Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer, were invited to and attended the 2019 lunch, and Blitzer has attended the lunch 20 years in a row, according to the network. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.
