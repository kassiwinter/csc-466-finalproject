WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joe Biden will visit the early caucus state of Iowa next week, stirring speculation once again about the possibility of a presidential run in 2016.Biden will travel to Des Moines on Thursday to tout the Obama administration's policies on the economy at Drake University, the White House announced. The vice president will also participate in a roundtable at Des Moines Area Community College, where he will presumably discuss President Barack Obama's proposal to offer "free" community college to American students.If Biden, 72, were to be elected president in 2016, he would take office at age 74, making him the oldest person ever to do so. Former President Ronald Reagan, the current record holder, assumed the office at age 69.Biden said in an interview last month that there is "a chance" he will run for president in 2016, regardless of whether his fellow Democrat, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, decides to do the same, as she is expected to do.“But I haven’t made my mind up about that," Biden said at the time. "We’ve got a lot of work to do between now and then. There’s plenty of time."The vice president has consistently ranked at or near the bottom in most early polls asking Democratic voters whom they would like to be their party's presidential candidate in 2016. In a recent poll of Iowa voters, Biden trailed both Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Joe Biden Makes Faces At VP Debate
