Stocks, bonds and commodities fell Wednesday in a simultaneous selloff as investors scrambled to raise cash to buffet themselves against the widening economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 20000 for the first time since early 2017, the yield on the one-month U.S. Treasury bill briefly turned negative for the first time in almost five years, and oil prices tumbled to the lowest level since 2002. The carnage in the stock market was broad and deep. Myriad stocks were trading at their lowest levels in five years or more. Trading was halted intraday for the fourth time this month after the S&P 500 lost more than 7%, triggering a circuit breaker.                         United Airlines Holdings,        UAL 2.26%       MGM Resorts International and Carnival all lost more than 25% Wednesday. That extended a bruising selloff: all three stocks have lost about three-quarters of their value over the past month.               Investors even shunned assets like government bonds and gold that are normally considered the safest, which rarely happens when stocks are also falling. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.259% from 0.994% Tuesday as bond prices tumbled. Gold fell 3.1%, and silver declined 5.9%.     The selling of government debt shows the market mentality has completely flipped, said         Peter Boockvar,    chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.     “Now that they’ve gotten around to U.S. Treasurys, that tells you that legitimately nothing is safe,” he said. “There’s no place to hide other than cash.”     The Dow industrials ended the day down 1,338.46 points, or 6.3%, to 19898.92. At one point, it was down more than 2,300 points.     The S&P 500 dropped 131.09 points, or 5.2%, to 2398.10. The Nasdaq Composite declined 344.94 points, or 4.7%, to 6989.84. All three indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs.     The speed and depth of this downturn has surprised even veterans of past downturns. During the financial crisis, the Dow industrials lost about 54% from their October 2007 high to the bottom in March 2009, a span of 355 trading sessions. The index has now lost 33% since its February record in just over a month—24 sessions.     “It’s happening so fast, it’s almost too much to grasp at this point,” said Frank Cappelleri, the executive director at Instinet. “It’s at the point where if you check the futures at nighttime and you’re not limit-down, it’s a relief.”     The market’s losses are accelerating as the pandemic escalates. The number of infections globally crossed 200,000, more than doubling in just two weeks. Governments are asking citizens abroad to come home and those already at home to stay there.      Detroit’s Big Three auto makers—         General Motors,        Ford Motor    and       Fiat Chrysler Automobiles    —agreed Wednesday to temporarily shut down their U.S. factories, The Wall Street Journal reported. And New York City is working with the hospitality industry to potentially convert entire hotels into hospitals.     The S&P 500 has now risen or fallen at least 4% in eight consecutive sessions, the longest streak in history, according to Dow Jones Market Data, breaking a streak of six days during the 1929 market crash                                         Senators vow speedy action on a stimulus plan that includes checks for Americans, the U.S. travel industry asks for a bailout and four Brooklyn Nets players test positive: WSJ’s Shelby Holliday has the latest on the pandemic.

A month ago, stocks were hitting new records daily as investors bet on a rebound in corporate earnings. A week ago, investors were debating whether the pandemic would cause a recession. Now, the question is whether the economy will be thrown into its worst recession in decades.      Wednesday’s selloff kicked off overseas. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 3.9%, hitting its lowest level since June 2013. Most major Asian markets closed lower, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index falling 4.2%.     The volatility of recent days in the U.S. government bond market continued, with investors snapping up short-term government bonds that are the closest equivalent to cash: the yield on 1-month Treasury bills fell as low as -0.033% from 0.08% Tuesday, according to FactSet, trading in negative territory for the first time since 2015. In the afternoon, it rose back to a positive 0.018%.     In commodity markets, U.S. crude futures plunged 24% to $20.37 a barrel, the lowest level since early 2002 as Saudi Arabia and Russia forged ahead with plans to raise output in their continued price war. The demand for oil is also likely to drop as authorities globally escalate emergency measures to curtail the spread of the virus. Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, fell 13%.                Markets remain jittery despite a series of measures taken by central banks. In recent days, the Federal Reserve has slashed rates and extended terms on emergency loans to banks borrowing from its discount window, relaunched a financial-crisis-era commercial paper tool, and ensured dollars were available internationally via swap lines with five major central banks.     Those interventions show that the markets are having a hard time just functioning normally, said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management. And no amount of fiscal or monetary stimulus can provide the one thing everybody wants to know, he said. “Neither one can stave off infection,” he said.     Economists are slashing growth forecasts, with some warning the coronavirus will trigger a global recession. Deutsche Bank said gross domestic product could shrink 24% in the eurozone and 13% in the U.S. in the second quarter on an annual, seasonally adjusted basis—declines that would be the biggest in recorded history.
