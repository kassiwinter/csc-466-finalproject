WASHINGTON—Two high-stakes elections in Ohio and Kansas during the homestretch of primary season were too close to call late Tuesday, foreshadowing the fierce battle to come around the nation in November’s midterms.In an Ohio House district that President Trump won by 11 percentage points in 2016, Republican Troy Balderson claimed a razor-thin victory over Democrat Danny O’Connor, although the Associated Press said the race is too close to call. The closely watched Republican gubernatorial primary in Kansas also was headed to a photo finish with Kris Kobach, the state’s controversial secretary of state, running neck and neck against         Gov. Jeff Colyer.         Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted reported late Tuesday night that according to unofficial results, Mr. Balderson led Mr. O’Connor by 1,754 votes. Mr. Husted added there are 3,435 provisional ballots and 5,048 absentee ballots outstanding. State law forbids counting of those ballots until Aug. 18.           The provisional and absentee ballots could push the margin below 0.5%, which would trigger an automatic recount under Ohio law.     No matter the final outcome, the special election’s narrow margin could foreshadow trouble for the GOP’s effort to keep control of the House this November. Democrats need to win 23 seats from the GOP to take a majority.     The district is typical of the dozens of House seats targeted by Democrats, who hope to capitalize on suburban Republicans’ frustration with Mr. Trump.     The president, who appeared at a late rally to boost Mr. Balderson’s candidacy, claimed credit for shifting momentum in the race.          “After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.”     Mr. Balderson, in remarks claiming victory, offered effusive praise for Mr. Trump and Vice President      Mike Pence        for their campaign help.      “America is on the right path and we’re going to keep it going that way,” he said.                                          Ohio's special election to fill a vacant House seat offers a good window into the issues Democrats and Republicans will likely focus on this fall. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

Tomorrow we rest and we keep fighting through to November.”     A Green Party candidate, Joe Manchik, received a little over 1,000 votes, which loom large given the small margin of victory.      In the Republican gubernatorial primary in Kansas, Mr. Trump weighed in at the last minute with an endorsement of Mr. Kobach, as he did for Mr. Balderson, but his impact on the outcome was uncertain. It may have come too late to carry the day in a case where he was backing an antiestablishment conservative against a sitting governor.     Also, in Missouri, a proposed right-to-work law was defeated 66% to 33%. It would have ended a requirement that private-sector workers had to join a union or pay a fee if their workplace was unionized.     The results reflect a state of flux in U.S. politics since the election of Mr. Trump, a former television personality and real-estate developer who was a newcomer to politics when he won the presidential campaign in 2016.     Mr. Trump has engaged in the midterm congressional elections, particularly Republican primaries, in ways most presidents have resisted in recent years and his actions appear to have energized activists in both political parties.      Republicans sought to nationalize the Ohio race in its closing weeks. Although Mr. Balderson was a tepid fundraiser, outside GOP groups spent more than $4 million attacking Mr. O’Connor as a clone of House Democratic Leader      Nancy Pelosi        while Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence both visited the district with Mr. Balderson in the final week of race.     Republicans had held the Ohio seat uninterrupted since 1983, which was open following the resignation of GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi. He served in it for 18 years before resigning in January to lead a local business organization.     Corry Bliss, the executive director of the House GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, warned that other Republicans on the ballot this November should do a better job raising money than did Mr. Balderson.      Mr. O’Connor, a family-law attorney who is in his first term as Franklin County recorder, sought to keep his distance from Mrs. Pelosi, calling for “a new generation of leadership” in Congress.     But the 31-year-old fumbled a question about a speaker vote during an MSNBC interview last month, saying he would back “the Democratic candidate” in a close vote, even if it meant voting for Mrs. Pelosi. He subsequently reiterated that he wouldn’t back her.     While Mr. Balderson led every pre-election public poll that included all of the candidates on the ballot, Republicans in recent weeks grew concerned he would lose. A visit by Mr. Trump on Saturday night was intended to motivate a local party base that appeared uninterested in the race.

Mr. Balderson, a 56-year-old state senator, said Monday night in his hometown of Zanesville that while Mr. Trump brought energy to the campaign, his aim was to make the contest about the district and not the national political mood.     “This has gained so much national attention, and we didn’t want that,” he said. “We were trying to keep the national media out of it.”     In other races,         Gretchen Whitmer,    formerly the Democratic leader in the Michigan state Senate, secured her party’s gubernatorial nomination in the state, besting two candidates,         Abdul El-Sayed    and Shri Thanedar, who ran to her left politically. Mr. El-Sayed garnered the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose upset primary victory against         Rep. Joe Crowley    (D., N.Y.) has propelled her to national recognition.     Attorney General         Bill Schuette    won a four-way race to secure the Republican gubernatorial nomination. With the help of President Trump’s endorsement, he beat         Lt. Gov. Brian Calley    —who rescinded his support for Mr. Trump in October 2016 before ultimately voting for him—as well as Jim Hines and Patrick Colbeck.     In Michigan, former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib won the Democratic nomination to run unopposed in November for the House seat vacated by         Rep. John Conyers.    She would become the first Muslim woman in Congress.     —Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.     Write to Reid J.
