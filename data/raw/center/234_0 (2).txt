Rather, he falsely claimed he won the election and spread an array of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories alleging that widespread voter fraud had rigged the race against him.Trump's lawyers and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states he lost and with the Supreme Court, aiming to cancel or overturn Electoral College results. Most of those lawsuits avoided alleging fraud before a court, and none succeeded in flipping any electoral votes to Trump.The Oversight Committee at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday is holding its second hearing on the Jan. 6 invasion, during which a mob of hundreds of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and forced Congress into hiding, temporarily derailing Biden's victory from being confirmed.The hearing aims to address "unanswered questions" about the attempted insurrection, "including the Trump Administration's failure to anticipate, prepare for, and respond adequately to the attack," according to the panel.Rosen in the previous hearing on May 12 refused to say whether Trump directed him to try to advance the spurious claims of election fraud.Another hearing on the Capitol invasion, this one held by the Committee on House Administration, is also scheduled to start at the same time as the oversight panel's hearing.The Administration Committee will from Michael Bolton, inspector general for the U.S. Capitol Police, as it examines the department's response to the violent mob.
