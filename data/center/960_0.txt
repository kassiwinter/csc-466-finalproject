Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a drop of more than 8 million jobs and the unemployment rate to nearly reach 20%, which would have been the highest since the 1930s."The unemployment rate was solid; the participation rate was higher. This checks all the boxes for a solid report," said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. "So even though this was coming off a horrendous report the previous month, there's nothing that screams this is some sort of error that can be ignored. If anything, it suggests we should be looking for more good news next month."The report boosted confidence of a swift economic recovery among traders, leading them into stocks that would benefit the most from a broad reopening. "We're having an unbelievable day," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "The one thing I'm still cautious on is this incredible optimism trade is being driven without any earnings yet to support it."Shares of airlines jumped, adding to their big gains this week, as the industry added more summer flights. American Airlines jumped 11.1% Friday, while United Airlines shares gained 8.5%.
