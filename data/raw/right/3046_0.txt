                 | October 14, 2017 10:22 AM                 The founder of Hustler Magazine is offering $10 million for information that leads to the impeachment of President Trump.        Larry Flynt is running a full-page ad in Sunday's Washington Post offering the massive reward, Fox Business reported Friday.        "There is a strong case to be made that the last election was illegitimate in many ways — and that after nine tumultuous months in office, Trump has proven he's dangerously unfit to exercise the extreme power accrued by our ‘unitary executive,'" the ad reads.        Among the reasons Trump should be impeached, the ad argues, is Trump's abrupt firing of former FBI Director James Comey, his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal, and risking a nuclear war.        The ad warns that impeachment "would be messy" but keeping Trump in office for at least three more years "is worse."        Flynt then calls for Trump's unreleased tax returns or documentation on his investments to be leaked.        "We need to flush everything out into the open," Flynt writes, adding that he could spend the $10 million on other things, "but what good would that do me in a world devastated by the most powerful moron in history?"        The Washington Post told Fox Business it gives advertisers "wide latitude to have their say."        "Generally, if the ads are not illegal or advocating illegal actions, we try not to place limits on speech or content," the paper said in a statement.                          In the past, Flynt has tried to sink other Republican lawmakers with a $1 million reward for information on former Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston and former Louisiana Sen. David Vitter.
