The first round of money was sent in March 2020. The new package passed by Congress will deliver $600 to qualifying Americans earning up to $75,000 annually. There is also a provision that provides $600 for each dependent child, according to Fox5DC. There have been ongoing talks about a $2000 payment as proposed by President Donald Trump but Congress has yet to agree on this. President-elect Joe Biden said that he considered the second COVID-19 relief package a “down payment” and he would plan on asking Congress for more funds when in office according to CNBC.
