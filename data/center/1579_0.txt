                                                  Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Saturday ended his six-year run as a TV host on Fox News to consider a White House bid.          Associated Press                                                                                                                                  Updated Jan. 3, 2015 9:08 pm ET                      Former Arkansas Gov.         Mike Huckabee    announced Saturday night on his Fox News show that he is leaving the network after more than six years to consider another bid for the Republican presidential nomination.     Mr. Huckabee, who ran for president in 2008, said he will decide on a 2016 campaign in late spring.      “The continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them nor is it possible for me to openly determine political and financial support to justify a race,” he said. “The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox. As much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run.”        
Related        Mr. Huckabee teased his announcement on Twitter on Saturday afternoon, saying: “Don’t miss my show tonight on Fox.”               This is not the first time Mr. Huckabee has used his Fox News show to ramp up speculation about his political plans. In 2011, he announced at the tail end of his show—after a jam session with rocker         Ted Nugent    —that he would not run for president.     Mr. Huckabee, 59 years old, is a Baptist preacher with strong ties to the social conservative wing of his party.     He joins what’s likely to be a crowded Republican field representing all different types of GOP candidates. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has previously announced that he’s considering a run.     In 2008, Mr. Huckabee won the Iowa caucus and about a half dozen other Republican primary contests, mostly in the South. He dropped out in March after         John McCain    emerged as the likely nominee.     Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
