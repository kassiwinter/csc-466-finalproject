TEL AVIV—Buoyed by a resounding victory in a party leadership election, Israeli Prime Minister         Benjamin Netanyahu    brandished his close ties with President Trump to woo right-wing voters as he attempts to break a monthslong political deadlock in the country.Mr. Netanyahu defeated Likud rival Gideon Saar in Thursday’s primary contest, winning nearly three-quarters of the votes despite corruption charges against him, to lead the party in March’s national election. He failed to form a ruling coalition after inconclusive votes in April and September. “Now is the time to unite and bring a sweeping victory to the right and the Likud in the upcoming elections,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech Friday, attempting to use the momentum from his primary victory to tap a larger audience.     Promising voters historic achievements in his next candidacy, Mr. Netanyahu said his relationship with Mr. Trump had delivered right-wing achievements once believed to be beyond reach.               Since coming to office, Mr. Trump’s administration has recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there—changing decades of U.S. policy on a sensitive issue between Israelis and Palestinians. It also has recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the contested Golan Heights and declared that it no longer sees Israeli settlements in the West Bank as contrary to international law.         Related        Mr. Netanyahu said he would now get the U.S. to recognize his intended annexation of the Jordan Valley—an area of land in the West Bank along the border with Jordan—as well as recognize Israeli sovereignty over all Israeli settlements in the West Bank. He said he would also get the U.S. to sign a defense pact with Israel that would leave intact his country’s freedom of action.     After Mr. Netanyahu said recently he was working with the Trump administration to coordinate his annexation plans in the West Bank, the State Department said its position is that the fate of the territory should be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians.     Pro-Israel policies resonate with many white evangelical voters who are among the most loyal Trump supporters.     Mr. Netanyahu’s successive governments have drifted further to the right as he has alienated potential allies from the left-wing and centrist camps over the years. Unable to find a single partner outside of his Likud party that isn’t a religious right-wing party, Mr. Netanyahu has been attempting to squeeze every possible vote out of his potential right-wing base.                                                 Blue and White leader Benny Gantz said Israel must set out on a new course.

Last month, he was indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust—charges he denies. As long as Mr. Netanyahu is a lawmaker, he can ask the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, to grant him immunity.     Neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his main rival, former army chief         Benny Gantz    of the Blue and White party, have managed to form a coalition government in Israel’s fractious political landscape after two elections this year. The country has been bitterly divided over the political future of Mr. Netanyahu and neither camp has a path to clear majority.     With Mr. Netanyahu firmly at the helm of Likud and campaigning for a narrow right-wing government, Israel seems headed for further political paralysis as numerous polls have shown a third election will likely produce near identical voting patterns to the past two.

Mr. Gantz has refused to sit in a government with Mr. Netanyahu serving as prime minister as long as the Likud leader was under indictment. He rebuffed offers from Mr. Netanyahu after the September vote to rotate the premiership.     On Friday, Mr. Gantz said Mr. Netanyahu’s overwhelming victory in the Likud primary showed Israel’s ruling party is committed to legitimizing the type of corruption Mr. Netanyahu is accused of.     “The state of Israel must set out on a new course. To make that happen, Blue and White must achieve a decisive outcome that will extricate us from both political deadlock and a path of corruption,” Mr. Gantz said.     An indictment filed against Mr. Netanyahu by Israel’s attorney general last month accuses him of trading official favors in exchange for flattering news coverage and gifts valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars, including bottles of pink champagne, cigars and jewelry. The most serious charges against him, bribery, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.     Mr. Netanyahu is expected to announce soon whether he will formally request immunity from Israel’s Parliament.     Following Mr. Netanyahu’s primary win, many of his right-wing and religious political allies expressed their support for him.     “I’m glad for the great expression of trust you received…We’ll preserve the right-wing bloc and, with God’s help, establish a strong right-wing government,”         Aryeh Deri,    head of the ultraorthodox Shas party, tweeted on Friday.
