                                                                                                                                         Syria’s prime minister escaped a daring assassination attempt on Monday when an attacker targeted his convoy in downtown Damascus and detonated a bomb.                                                                                                                                                      “The terrorist explosion in al-Mezze was an attempt to target the convoy of the prime minister,” state media reported. “Doctor Wael al-Halqi is well and not hurt at all.”                                                                                                                                                      Television broadcasts from the scene showed firefighters rushing to put out the blaze from the explosion.                                                                                                                                                                    Rebel fighters reportedly placed an explosive device beneath a car that was parked near the convoy, The Associated Press reported. It was then detonated when his car drove past.                                                                                                                              The area of attack is where many high-ranking members of President Bashar Assad’s government live, AP said.                                                                                                                                                       Despite the failure to kill the premier, rebel forces still celebrated the attack. It showed the ability of fighters to hit at Mr. Assad’s heart of power, AP reported.
