INDIANAPOLIS—President Trump said Friday he would withdraw the U.S. as a signatory to a global arms treaty that President         Obama    supported but Congress never ratified.“We will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone,”         Mr. Trump    declared at a speech before the National Rifle Association in Indianapolis. The Arms Trade Treaty seeks to regulate the international sale of conventional weapons. It was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 and signed that year by Mr. Obama, but the pact has never been ratified by Congress. Mr. Trump signed a letter Friday asking the Senate to simply return the unratified document to the White House.     The NRA, a key backer of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, was a leading opponent of the treaty, arguing it could impinge on the rights of American gun owners.               The treaty has been ratified by 101 countries, including the member states of the European Union, but a senior administration official noted that China and Russia aren’t parties to it.      While some U.S. conservatives say the treaty could open the door to stricter gun regulations at home, some people familiar with the document say it has no effect on domestic arms sales or gun rights.     “The treaty has no impact whatsoever on Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens,” said Thomas Countryman, a former assistant secretary of state who was the lead U.S. negotiator for the treaty.      Mr. Countryman said he had been given explicit instructions by the Obama administration to negotiate the treaty’s language in such a way that the U.S. would be in compliance immediately, without having to change any laws at home. That wasn’t a problem, he said, because the U.S. has for decades had strict arms-export laws.     “The U.S. has long been the leader in saying there has to be a careful process of deciding on arms exports so they don’t go to regimes that the U.S. doesn’t like and so they’re not diverted for use in civil conflict,” Mr. Countryman said.     The goal of the treaty wasn’t to crack down on U.S. manufacturers or tighten domestic laws, he said, but to ensure other countries were following the example in place for decades under U.S. law. The treaty doesn’t hurt U.S. manufacturers, he added, and has the potential to strengthen their business by leveling the playing field among international arms dealers by ensuring they all subscribe to the same standards.              Rachel Stohl,    managing director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank, said the decision was part of a U.S. retreat from global leadership.     “Un-signing the Arms Trade Treaty will undermine international peace and security, increase irresponsible and illegal sales of conventional weapons, and harm the American economy,” she said in a statement.              Ted Bromund,    a senior research fellow in Anglo-American relations at the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, praised the president for withdrawing from a treaty that “has achieved nothing.”     Mr. Bromund cited low levels of compliance with the treaty as evidence of its failure and said nations are free to impose their own legal controls on arms exports.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman         Eliot Engel    (D., N.Y.) decried Mr. Trump’s decision as “a politically-motivated appeasement of the National Rifle Association,” and said he would convene a hearing on the matter.     In February, Mr. Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which Washington alleged Moscow has violated by deploying multiple battalions of a prohibited cruise missile.     In his third visit as president to an NRA annual convention, Mr. Trump pledged his support for gun rights, touted the strength of the U.S. economy, and railed against the recently completed Mueller investigation.     “They tried for a coup, it didn’t work out that well,” Mr. Trump said before a cheering crowd of 15,000. “I didn’t need a gun for that one, did I?”     Mr. Trump also warned the crowd that “far-left radicals in Congress” want to take their guns, saying “that will never happen as long as I’m president, not even close.”     Mr. Trump shared the stage with other leaders, including Vice President      Mike Pence        and Rep. Steve Scalise (R., La.), who was shot by a gunman at a baseball practice for GOP lawmakers in 2017.     The president received a rousing reception from NRA members, despite criticism from some hard-line gun-rights advocates of his record on guns. The only major action Mr. Trump had taken on guns since being elected was to ban bump stocks, devices used in the September 2017 Las Vegas massacre that make semiautomatic rifles fire like machine guns. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump hasn’t signed into law any major pro-gun legislation.     —Alex Leary and Courtney McBride contributed to this article.
