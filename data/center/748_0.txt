(Updated: 12:55 p.m. EDT, April 7, 2020) Topline: President Trump—increasingly a booster of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus—has a “small personal financial interest” in Sanofi, a French drugmaker that produces a brand-name version of the drug—though it’s a tiny investment for the billionaire.     Sanofi produces Plaquenil, the brand-name form of hydroxychloroquine, the New York Times reported; the drug is typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and malaria.  Trump’s three family trusts have investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund, with Sanofi as the largest holding, according to the Times.  Forbes estimates the value of Trump’s Sanofi holdings to be less than $3,000; for context, Forbes estimates Trump's total net worth at $2.1 billion  Billionaire Ken Fisher, a major Republican donor (including to Trump), is one of Sanofi’s largest shareholders, while Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross used to run a fund that invested in Sanofi, the Times reported.  “Sanofi is neither a material holding of Fisher Investments nor of Ken Fisher personally,” Fisher Investments said in a statement, adding, “The company represents less than 0.8% of Fisher Investments’ portfolio, and the firm’s ownership is less than 0.7% of Sanofi.”  Trump in recent weeks has promoted the drug as coronavirus has swept through America, but hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against COVID-19 has not been conclusively proven in scientific studies.  Hydroxychloroquine, the Washington Post reported Monday, has serious side effects, including a possible risk of irregular heartbeats, when COVID-19 is causing a heart infection in some of the most seriously ill patients.  A Sanofi spokesperson told the Times that the company no longer sells or distributes Plaquenil in the U.S., but does sell the drug internationally.   Crucial quote: “What really do we have to lose?” Trump asked during a Sunday press briefing, adding that, because people are dying from COVID-19, “We don’t have time to say, ‘Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out.’”  Key background: Trump said Sunday that the Food and Drug Administration has approved hydroxychloroquine. But the FDA has not approved it⁠—or any drug⁠—to treat COVID-19, CNN reported. The FDA did, however, green-light hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to test as coronavirus treatments on March 19, 2020. Since then, the federal government has moved to stockpile millions of the pills.  Surprising fact: The French organization that published a positive study on hydroxychloroquine cited by Trump’s allies walked back the findings Friday, saying it does not meet their “expected standard.”  Tangent: When Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases expert, was asked directly about the effectiveness of the drug Sunday, Trump cut the reporter off, saying there had been enough questions about it.
