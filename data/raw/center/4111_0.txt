WASHINGTON—A dozen Senate Republicans joined Democrats on Thursday to reject President Trump’s emergency declaration at the southern border, rebuking the president on his signature policy issue after he pushed to use funds that weren’t appropriated by Congress. The vote set up Mr. Trump for the first veto of his presidency and came one day after the Senate passed a resolution to withdraw U.S. forces in Yemen, which Mr. Trump is also expected to veto when it passes the House. Lawmakers aren’t likely to have the votes to override either veto. In a 59 to 41 vote, the Senate passed a resolution to terminate the president’s declaration, which was part of a White House plan to secure $6.7 billion to build more barriers on the border with Mexico.     Mr. Trump made the declaration last month, after Congress authorized $1.38 billion for such barriers. His move angered members of both parties, who had agreed on that figure as part of a deal that funded the government through September, not long after a five-week partial government shutdown.          “What was more litigated than this very question? We had a government shutdown, for crying out loud,” said         Sen. Pat Toomey    (R., Pa.), who joined Democrats in supporting the resolution. “The bill passed and it was signed into law and in my view, the National Emergencies Act is not meant to circumvent duly passed legislation.”     The resolution had been expected to pass for nearly two weeks, after a handful of Republican senators declared their intention to back it. Vice President      Mike Pence        lobbied GOP senators earlier this week to prevent an embarrassing vote for the White House, but the number of defections grew.      The president, while publicly calling for fellow Republicans to vote against the resolution, didn’t mount a full-court press to defeat the resolution. He also dismissed a late-hour Republican effort, headed by         Sen. Mike Lee    of Utah, to give Congress more control over future emergency declarations as a way to allow the border emergency to proceed.     “Nobody is beaten up,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday when asked about the lobbying effort. “I said, ‘Use your own discretion.’”           After the vote, Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday that he looked “forward to VETOING the just passed Democrat inspired Resolution.” While not directly acknowledging the GOP defections, Mr. Trump thanked “all of the Strong Republicans” who voted against it.     Overriding Mr. Trump’s veto would require a two-thirds majority in each chamber, or 67 votes in the Senate and about 290 in the House. Only 13 Republicans supported the resolution when it passed the Democratic-controlled House last month, leaving it far short of the number needed in that body. A Democratic leadership aide said the House would hold a vote later this month on overturning the veto.     While the veto is likely to stand, the brushback from Congress underscores the limits of Mr. Trump powers with Democrats now controlling the House after two years of the GOP in charge of both chambers of Congress. Senate Republicans have largely backed Mr. Trump’s hard-line positions on border security, but many expressed concern that Mr. Trump’s action impinged on Congress’s power and warned of the precedent it could set for a future Democratic president on progressive priorities such as climate change.     “Never before has a president asked for a certain amount of money, the Congress refused to provide that amount, and then the president spent the amount he asked for anyway,”         Sen. Lamar Alexander    (R., Tenn.) said.              Sen. Kevin Cramer    (R., N.D.), who opposed the resolution, said lawmakers bore some responsibility for Mr. Trump’s action. “For those of us who want to claim purity as the reason for a ‘yes’ vote today, I remind them that we were complicit in this because we were so anxious to make sure the government didn’t get shut down again, we agreed to a lower [border funding] number and he agreed to sign it,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, have remained united in opposing Mr. Trump’s border plans and blasted his efforts to use the emergency declaration. “Today’s votes cap a week of something the American people haven’t seen enough of in the past two years: Both parties in the United States Congress standing up to      Donald Trump,        ”         Sen. Chuck Schumer    of New York, the Democratic leader, said after the vote.     The Senate reproach on the emergency declaration came less than 24 hours after the chamber voted Wednesday for a measure to end U.S. military assistance for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, pushing back on the Trump administration’s steadfast support for the kingdom. The Yemen measure heads back to the House, where it is expected to pass, setting up another potential veto from Mr. Trump.     “There are ways in which even in this Congress, even with this Senate majority, the president is at risk of losing the support of the Senate when he exceeds presidential power or when he makes abrupt or unwise shifts in policy,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.).     Mr. Trump is seeking $6.7 billion overall in additional funding for barriers. He is relying on the emergency declaration for about $3.6 billion of that total to enable him to tap funds from military construction projects. Using executive actions, the White House also plans to divert $2.5 billion from the Defense Department’s effort to fight illegal drugs and $600 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.     While the expected veto will keep Mr. Trump’s declaration in place, it also faces challenges outside of Congress. On Wednesday, four more states joined a federal lawsuit challenging it, bringing the total to 20. The states are seeking injunctive relief to block the emergency declaration and any diversion of congressionally appropriated funds.      There are also questions remaining about how quickly wall funds could be disbursed and where any additional barriers would be built.     In a hearing with top defense officials Thursday, several senators criticized the Pentagon for not providing a list of military construction projects that stand to be tapped to divert funds to a border wall. Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) said he felt “sandbagged” by the Pentagon because it had so far refused to list what construction projects could be affected.     Acting Defense Secretary         Pat Shanahan    told lawmakers he would provide that list by the end of the day—after the Senate vote. By Thursday evening, Mr. Shanahan hadn’t provided a list.     The vote, in splintering the Republican caucus, also sent signals about how re-election concerns could affect GOP senators up for re-election in 2020 in competitive states. “My job is to stand up for the Constitution, let the chips fall where they may,” said         Sen. Susan Collins    of Maine, who opposed the resolution. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who had originally announced he would support the resolution, changed his position minutes before the vote on Thursday and sided with Mr. Trump.
