         WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Brooklyn on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meaning the government will once more have to accept new applications for the program that protects immigrants living in the U.S. since childhood without legal permission.     The order concludes a three-year legal battle over the Trump administration’s attempt to kill DACA, which the Supreme Court ruled it did improperly because it didn’t follow the proper procedure for federal policy-making.      That means, for the first time since September 2017, new applicants who weren’t previously eligible, typically because they were too young, may now apply for the program. The Friday ruling also asks the government to issue two-year permits for it.     “Today’s decision from a federal judge in New York is a victory for the courageous directly impacted plaintiffs, all DACA recipients and DACA-eligible youth,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, state and local policy manager for United We Dream and herself a DACA recipient.               The DACA program was created by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer work permits and deportation protections to young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been living in the country without legal permission since childhood. To apply, an immigrant must have arrived in the U.S. before age 16, lived in the country since 2007 and have a high-school diploma or a GED.                                                 At the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse on Friday, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis ordered DHS to attempt to reach people potentially eligible for the DACA program.

Garaufis    of the Eastern District of New York, ruled in November that a memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security narrowing the program was invalid because         Chad Wolf,    the acting secretary, isn’t legally serving in that role. That memo had sought to close the program to new applicants and issue one-year permits, rather than two, to existing DACA recipients on a case-by-case basis.     “All parties agree that the DACA program is currently governed by its terms as they existed prior to the attempted rescission of September 2017,” Judge Garaufis wrote in Friday’s order.     In a statement Saturday evening, Chase Jennings, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, labeled Judge Garaufis an “activist judge” and said his ruling didn’t follow “sound law or logic.”     “We will abide by this decision while we work with [the Justice Department] on next steps to appeal,” he said.      Judge Garaufis, appointed by President Clinton in 2000, further ordered DHS to post publicly that it is accepting new applications for the program by Monday, and to make attempts to reach people potentially eligible for the program. As many as 300,000 young immigrants could qualify, according to the Center for American Progress, an estimate also cited by lawyers in the case.      Friday’s order doesn’t represent the end of the road for DACA recipients. Though President-elect      Joe Biden        has pledged he would fully restore the program had the court not already done so, DACA faces a different legal challenge. In that case, which will be heard in Texas later this month, Republican attorneys general have asked a different federal judge to rule the program unlawful. That litigation, filed in 2017, was put on hold while a challenge to President Trump’s DACA cancellation made its way through the courts.
