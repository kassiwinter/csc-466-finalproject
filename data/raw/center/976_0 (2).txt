Mr. Alexis was a New York native who lived in Fort Worth, Texas, and worked in a Navy fleet logistics support squadron based there before he was discharged from the military after a 2010 arrest for firing a gun at his apartment. The incident sent a bullet into a neighbor's property a few days after an alleged confrontation with the neighbor over noise.                                                      Suspected gunman Aaron Alexis          Associated Press                                                                                                             No one was injured and no charges were filed, according to the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney's Office. According to the police report, Mr. Alexis said that "he was trying to clean his gun while cooking and that his hands were slippery."     A defense official said that Mr. Alexis was pushed out of the military following the apartment incident. "There is no question there was a pattern of misconduct," the official said.          In a 2004 incident in Seattle, police said Mr. Alexis had been arrested for shooting out the tires of another man's vehicle in an anger-fueled "blackout." Mr. Alexis told police at the time he had been deeply disturbed by events he witnessed during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Police said Mr. Alexis's father said his son had been involved in 9/11 rescue efforts and had post-traumatic stress and anger-management issues.               Following his separation from the Navy, Mr. Alexis began working at Happy Bowl Thai, a restaurant in Fort Worth.     The restaurant's owner, Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, said in an interview that he met Mr. Alexis roughly three years ago at a Fort Worth area Buddhist temple. The two became friends and drinking buddies. Mr. Suthamtewakul said he invited Mr. Alexis to move in with him after the apartment incident. Mr. Alexis, who spoke fluent Thai, also took a job at the Thai restaurant, the owner said.                                         Officials named 34-year-old Aaron Alexis of Fort Worth, Texas as the gunman in the Navy Yard shootings that left 13 people including Mr. Alexis dead, and said it appeared he acted alone.                                                                                                     Mr. Alexis was a "hard-core drinker," Mr. Suthamtewakul said. Another friend, Michael Ritrovato, a government worker, said he saw Mr. Alexis playing first-person shooting games online. Mr. Suthamtewakul said he and his family would sometimes bring Mr. Alexis plates of food during his videogame binges.     During this time Mr. Alexis also sought spiritual enlightenment at the Buddhist Thai temple, members said. Mr. Alexis began coming to the Wat Busaya Dhammavanaram Meditation Center in 2010. He participated in chanting and meditation sessions, and had a keen interest in Thai culture, said Pat Pundisto, one of the temple's members.     Mr. Suthamtewakul said Mr. Alexis moved out of his home in May following friction between his wife and Mr. Alexis over the family's cats, which Mr. Alexis disliked. He said he was shocked his friend was identified as the alleged shooter.     So were customers at the Thai restaurant, some of whom recalled Mr. Alexis as a polite man who fixed patrons' computers.     After the restaurant, he found a job with an information-technology company called The Experts, which         Hewlett-Packard Co.    described as a subcontractor for an H-P contract for the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network. He had been rehired by the firm in July for a project at the Washington Navy Yard after an earlier stint in Japan.     He also was taking online classes with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, the school said.     —Julian E. Barnes contributed to this article.
