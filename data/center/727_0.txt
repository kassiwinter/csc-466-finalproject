WASHINGTON—President Trump on Sunday said he was extending the administration’s social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April, after saying for days that he was hoping to open up the country in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, said the peak of the death rate from the new coronavirus was expected to hit in two weeks. Mr. Trump predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by June 1. “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,” he said. “It’s very important that everybody strongly follow the guidelines.”     The administration earlier had announced a 15-day program that instructed all Americans to avoid nonessential travel, sit-down restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people, among other steps. Governors and mayors nationwide have rolled out their own restrictions, shutting schools and many retail businesses.

The president said his earlier comments that he hoped to reopen the U.S. by Easter on April 12 were “just an aspiration.”               Mr. Trump extended the guidelines as coronavirus patients besieged hospitals in New York and other cities and the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,400 over the weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 800 of the deaths were in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, and New York state’s total death toll surpassed 1,000 on Sunday, according to city and state figures.     The global death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 33,881 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy, which has suffered the most fatalities.                                                 A skateboarder approaches the shuttered Santa Monica beach on Sunday.

Widespread testing is still a long way off and labs now are struggling with supply issues that are further hampering the ability to identify cases. The coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic.     Mr. Trump said he didn’t anticipate relaxing the guidelines before April 30 even for regions less affected by the virus.     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions.     “What we’re trying to do is not let that happen,” Dr. Fauci said at a White House press conference Sunday.        
The Latest on the Coronavirus  The CDC issued a domestic travel advisory for New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut Global virus infections reach 718,000; death toll hits 33,881 Confirmed cases in the U.S. exceed 139,000 China reopens domestic flights in Hubei, where the world’s first cases were reported late last year though they remain suspended in the capital Wuhan Governments in Asia announce stimulus packages to minimize the economic blow        Dr. Fauci and other federal public-health officials have said over 2 million deaths were possible if no social-distancing and other measures were taken.      “So, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying to 100,000—it’s a horrible number—maybe even less, but to 100,000—so we have between 100,000 to 200,000—we all together have done a very good job,” the president said.      Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients.     “We’ve put in orders with the national stockpile,” said Louisiana’s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “But we’ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.”     “I think thus far we’ve received 192,” Mr. Edwards said.     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process.     “Unfortunately we’re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,” Mr. Cuomo said Sunday.                            confirmed cases in the U.S.                 total deaths in the U.S.                   Source: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering       Mr. Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency brought 80 tons of personal protective equipment to New York on Sunday, including 130,000 N95 respirators, 1.8 million face masks and gowns and 10.3 million gloves. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights, and Mr. Trump said he hopes to have 51 flights in total.     “Many of the states are stocked up,” Mr. Trump said. “Some of them don’t admit it.”     Mr. Trump said he was instructing his administration to take steps to provide incentives to keep restaurants open, including instructing the Treasury Department and the Labor Department to examine reinstating corporate tax deductions for the cost of business meals and entertainment.      The president called on journalists and state officials to investigate the high volume of protective masks being ordered by hospitals, suggesting hospital workers were mismanaging the supply of masks.      “Where are the masks going?” Mr. Trump asked, adding later, “I don’t think it’s hoarding. I think it’s maybe worse than hoarding.”     Mr. Trump praised General Motors Co., saying the company was doing a “fantastic job” producing ventilators. His comments came two days after he invoked the Defense Production Act to order the company to make ventilators, accusing GM of “wasting time” in negotiations. “I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now,” he said.                                                 “Many of the states are stocked up,” Mr. Trump said. “Some of them don’t admit it.”                  Photo:            Patrick Semansky/Associated Press                                                                                                             The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 142,000, the most in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins data. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 718,000. Dr. Fauci said that there would be millions of cases this year in the U.S. and that infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon.     “We have a very difficult problem here,” he said. “We’re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.”     New York remained an epicenter in the U.S. Mr. Cuomo said the number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000—close to half of the nation’s total number of confirmed cases. At least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state.     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere.     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60-day jail sentence and fines of up to $500.     Other countries also moved to put lockdown measures in place. Italian officials warned that the nation’s strict measures likely will be extended, as data aren’t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes.         Related        By contrast, China, where the virus is believed to have originated, gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months.     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France.     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere.     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured.
