                  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo    on Tuesday declared a state of emergency over gun violence, which he said is now claiming more lives than Covid-19 and is a threat to the broader economic recovery.     The designation will allow the state to quickly release $138.7 million of funding for a series of initiatives, including summer recreation and violence interruption, which already operate in some areas of the state’s cities.      Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, also signed legislation that would allow people harmed by firearms to sue gun sellers and manufacturers if those entities acted recklessly and didn’t establish reasonable controls to prevent their products from being marketed or sold illegally in New York.                                                 Shootings have increased in New York City, where police investigated a case last month.

A spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms-trade association, said it plans to challenge the law in court.          The actions come as shootings in several of the state’s cities have increased from prior years. A recent poll found voters were more concerned about crime than education, and Mr. Cuomo said the perceived lack of safety could prevent the return of office workers to Manhattan and other urban centers.     “People are going to have to want to come back to work,” he said during a speech in Manhattan. “They’re not coming back unless they feel safe. They’re going to have to want to come back to New York City.”      Shootings and homicides in New York City rose last year and have continued to increase in the first half of 2021. The New York Police Department recorded 718 shootings from Jan. 1 through June 27, compared with 503 in the same period last year.     According to data gathered by the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services from other large police departments around the state, 511 people were injured or killed by shootings in the first five months of 2021, compared with 313 for the same period in 2020. The increases were highest in the upstate cities of Buffalo, Rochester and Albany. Eight people have been killed by gun violence in Albany through May, according to the state, compared with one person over the same period in 2020.     The governor announced a multipronged approach that would dedicate $58 million funding for summer-employment programs designed to help 21,000 people. The state will double funding for violence-interruption programs such as SNUG, in which nonprofit organizations hire outreach workers to act as mediators in inner-city disputes.

The executive order declaring the disaster—the text of which wasn’t immediately available—will waive state laws requiring pre-review and competitive bidding of certain expenditures, state officials said. A spokeswoman for Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, who oversees most state expenditures, declined to comment.     A spokesman for New York City Mayor         Bill de Blasio    said Mr. Cuomo’s plan reflected efforts against gun violence already under way in New York City, including the city’s summer-jobs program.     Republican leaders of the state Assembly and Senate said Mr. Cuomo’s executive order would circumvent the Legislature and was a distraction from recent changes to state law that eliminated monetary bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony offenses. Some law enforcement and police-union officials have said the bail law has contributed to the rise in shootings. Supporters of the change say it makes the criminal justice system fairer.     Gun-control groups said the new law allowing for lawsuits would help New York officials stem the flow of illegal guns from other states, but acknowledged that the law would be quickly challenged in court. Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday the she looked forward to enforcing the law and defending it against legal challenges.     Tom King of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, a gun-rights group, said he believed the new law wouldn’t make anybody safer and could drive the gun industry out of the state.
