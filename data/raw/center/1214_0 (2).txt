Vice President      Joe Biden        brought support for Kiev and stern new warnings for Moscow as he arrived in Ukraine in a bid to break a stalemate over unrest along the country's eastern edge.As Washington prepared for another round of sanctions against Russia as early as this week, Moscow and Kiev accused each other of violating last week's Geneva agreement, which was meant to defuse the crisis.

The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,         Geoffrey Pyatt,    said on Monday that the Russians would have to take decisive action to comply with the Geneva agreement and avoid new sanctions.     "It's still too early to tell if this is going to succeed," Mr. Pyatt said of the Geneva deal. "The ball is really in Moscow's court in terms of whether they're going to take this diplomatic off-ramp."               Mr. Pyatt reiterated other Obama administration threats that the sanctions against Moscow would come in "days, not weeks."           Related           Administration officials haven't made clear whether the next round of U.S. sanctions would target individuals and companies or if they would aim to damage broad swaths of Russia's economy.     Ukraine has accused the pro-Russian forces that have seized control of 10 cities in the eastern part of the country of failing to vacate occupied government buildings and remove roadblocks in the region, as specified in the deal.                                                 U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrives at the Boryspil airport in Kiev on Monday.          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images                                                                                                             Russian Foreign Minister         Sergei Lavrov,    in turn, accused the Ukrainian government of violating last week's agreement by not moving to immediately disarm what he called extremists in Ukraine.     The U.S. leveled similar charges of foot-dragging against Moscow. "We've seen certain activities that have been discouraging," a senior administration official said.      Mr. Biden, the highest ranking U.S. official to visit since the crisis began, planned meetings on Tuesday with Ukrainian leaders, including acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. His arrival in Kiev on Monday coincided with that of a U.S. team of energy experts to work on providing Ukraine with short-term supplies, said the senior administration official.     The U.S. also is preparing a new package of economic, energy and governance assistance, the official said, although it won't include additional money.     A Sunday morning shootout on the outskirts of Slovyansk, a city that has been a focal point for pro-Russian unrest in eastern Ukraine, became the latest flash point.     Russia has blamed the violence on a small Ukrainian ultranationalist group, Pravy Sektor. Mr. Lavrov said it was a sign that Kiev is "either unable or reluctant to control extremists."                
Related           "Claims are being made against the southeastern regions over the failure to vacate the occupied buildings and to remove roadblocks but the authorities have done nothing, haven't lifted a finger, to do away with the causes of the profound Ukrainian internal crisis," he said.      Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine has been overrun by armed fascists who are threatening the rights of ethnic Russians, although little evidence of such threats has emerged.     Ukrainian officials and representatives of Pravy Sektor denied any role in Sunday's shooting and accused Russia of provoking it to undermine the Geneva agreement and to justify a future invasion.     Russia has moved tens of thousands of troops close to the Ukrainian border and has repeatedly said it reserves the right to defend the interests of ethnic Russians living in eastern Ukraine.          Mr. Lavrov said the U.S. is responsible for the decisions of the new Ukrainian government and shouldn't "turn a blind eye on the violence committed by this regime and the militants that this regime relies on."     "Before declaring ultimatums and demanding that we do something within two or three days and otherwise threatening further sanctions, we would like to urge our American partners to fully realize their responsibility for those they have brought to power," he said.     Ukraine's new government took over after months of pro-Western protests led to the ouster of President         Viktor Yanukovych,    a Kremlin ally, in February. Elections are set for May 25, but Russia has refused to support them.     Moscow still recognizes Mr. Yanukovych as Ukraine's legitimate leader, even as it moved last month to annex the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.     Russian President      Vladimir Putin        on Monday submitted a draft bill to parliament that would designate Crimea a legal gambling zone.     Russia has moved swiftly to incorporate the peninsula since it seceded from Ukraine in March and has proposed a number of plans to encourage investment and absorb the territory into the national infrastructure.     In addition to building a bridge to connect Crimea to mainland Russia and laying communications lines under the narrow strait that separates the two, Russian officials have suggested declaring the region a special economic zone and creating a special tax regime to attract investors.      Efforts are also under way to reduce Crimea's dependence on Ukraine for electricity and water supplies.     On Friday, Crimea's acting leader         Sergei Aksyonov    told the Itar-Tass news agency that if the bill passes, the region plans to create a specific gambling center rather than allow gambling everywhere on the peninsula.     In late March, Russian Prime Minister         Dmitry Medvedev    —during a visit to Crimea—urged Russian state companies, ministries and private corporations to send their employees to Crimea for summer vacations. He promised subsidies for air tickets to boost the local economy to make up for an expected shortfall in the much-needed tourist cash the region relies on.     The hastily arranged referendum for Crimea to leave Ukraine—which was conducted while the region was occupied by thousands of Russian troops—has been widely viewed in the West as illegitimate.      Russia's subsequent move to annex the region was met with sanctions from both the U.S. and European Union against a number of Russian officials and people close to Mr. Putin.     Write to Carol E.
