 New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg obliterated Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for owning three homes while declaring himself a socialist democrat during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sanders criticized President Donald Trump and Walmart over what he called "socialism for the rich," when Bloomberg inserted his verbal assault. "I believe in democratic socialism for the working people, not billionaires!" exclaimed Sanders. "Health care for all, educational opportunities for all!" "What a wonderful country we have!" interjected Bloomberg. "The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses! What'd I miss here?"  "Well, you miss that I work in Washington, house one!" exclaimed Sanders. "That's the first problem," Bloomberg retorted. 	"Live in Burlington, house two!" Sanders continued. "That's good!" said Bloomberg. "And like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp. Forgive me for that! Where is your home? Which tax haven do you have your home?" Sanders asked loudly. 	"New York City, thank you very much! And I pay all my taxes!" responded Bloomberg. 	Earlier in the debate, Bloomberg himself came under attack by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over comments attributed to him that were seen as sexist and misogynist. Sanders is considered by many to be the Democratic presidential front-runner after a disastrous showing for Joe Biden in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
