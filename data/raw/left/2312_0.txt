Hong / APNBC News declared the real estate mogul to be the presumptive Republican nominee after his remaining GOP competitors dropped out of the race in early May.Trump will not officially become the nominee until he accepts the nomination at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.Earlier in the race, Trump foes within the Republican Party hoped to prevent him from reaching the so-called "magic number" of a majority of delegates, forcing a contested nomination process that would have prompted a potentially chaotic power struggle between different factions of the GOP on the convention floor.But Trump deflated the hopes of rivals like Ted Cruz and John Kasich after decisively winning the Indiana primary on May 3 and putting himself easily within reach of a majority of delegates before the end of the primary process.Carrie Dann is a political editor for NBC News.
