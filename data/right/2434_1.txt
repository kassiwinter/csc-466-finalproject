           Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said Saturday that he would release his taxes before Election Day in November.
"I promise you, when my forms are filed and when my tax returns are released, it’s going to be a quick read," Pence told "Election Central with Rita Cosby" on WABC Radio in New York. "The Pences have not become more wealthy as a result of 16 years in public service.
"There's been a lot of sacrifices. We're a middle-class family — and it's been a tremendous honor to serve as the governor of Indiana, and my years in the Congress.
"We'll look forward to making all that information available," he said.
Pence's disclosure came a day after Hillary Clinton's campaign released her returns, showing that the Democratic candidate and former President Bill Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
The Clintons paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent last year — and most of the couple's income, more than $6 million, came from speaking fees for appearances made largely before the former secretary of state began her White House bid in April 2015.
Pence's running mate, Donald Trump, has not yet released his taxes.
He told Cosby that the information from Clinton's returns flies in the face of her "class-warfare rhetoric" she used in attacking Trump's economic plan in Michigan on Thursday.
"This is a very wealthy family — and for her to be leveling the criticisms at Donald Trump that she leveled yesterday for his success, I think … come into high relief," he said.
"What you have in the Clintons is an extremely prosperous family that's made tens of millions of dollars related to and derivative of their time in and around public service.
