The U.S. economic expansion is now the third-longest on record and showed no signs of letting up in February, with robust hiring, falling unemployment and firmer wage growth opening the way for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.Fed officials have signaled that their third post-financial crisis rate increase would be highly likely at their policy meeting next week. Friday’s report from the Labor Department offered much to strengthen their resolve. Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 235,000 from January, exceeding forecasters’ expectations, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7%. Average hourly earnings in the private sector rose 2.8% from a year earlier, a sign that the tightening job market is pushing employers to raise pay.     “It would have taken a terrible report for them not to move, and this was not a terrible report,” said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at         PNC Financial Services Group.                   Healthy job gains and buoyant financial markets, combined with strength in gauges of U.S. consumer and business sentiment, raise the possibility that rising optimism could lead to faster economic growth.           White House press secretary         Sean Spicer    said on Friday that President      Donald Trump        has “jump-started job creation, not only because of his executive actions, but through the surge of economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election.”     However, it would be premature to conclude a boom is imminent. The mild winter likely boosted the pace of hiring, especially in the weather-sensitive construction sector. The construction industry added 58,000 jobs last month after adding 40,000 in January, strong gains that some economists said could lead to weaker readings in the spring.

The share of Americans in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who were employed in February, hit 78.3%, the highest level since October 2008. The labor-force participation rate ticked up to 63%, a sign that a healthier job market is stemming a tide of labor-force dropouts.     Richard Moody, chief economist at         Regions Financial Corp.    , said data on the manufacturing sector and business investment have looked increasingly upbeat. “There’s more going on here than people just feeling better,” he said. Manufacturers added 28,000 jobs in February and 57,000 positions over the past three months.     For the Fed, a key signal in Friday’s report was wage growth, which was stuck at 2% for years following the end of the 2007-2009 recession, partly due to slack in the labor market. Companies have felt increased pressure in recent years to raise pay as falling unemployment forced them to compete for a shrinking pool of available workers, and many states have raised minimum wages as well.          At 2.8%, February’s annual growth for private-sector hourly earnings matched the second-highest reading of the current expansion. Some of the strongest wage growth has come at the bottom of the pay scale; the leisure and hospitality sector, for instance, saw earnings rise 4.2% on the year.     “We can feel it tightening,” said Leanne Stapf, director of operations at the Cleaning Authority, a Columbia, Md., home-cleaning chain. The company is in the process of adding about 400 jobs this year, split between new locations and existing franchises that are expanding to handle growing demand.     Compared with a few years ago, she said, the Cleaning Authority is seeing “fewer applications, and fewer people are coming in for their interviews, and it’s getting harder for them to stay.” The company has raised pay across most of its locations, which she said has helped.     “We’re not just competing with household-cleaning companies,” Ms. Stapf said. “We’re competing with the entire hourly work space.”     The overall pace of hiring has picked up a bit in early 2017, with payroll growth averaging 237,000 over the first two months of the year, compared with a monthly average of 187,000 for all of 2016. Although weather may have played a role, job gains last month were broad across most sectors of the economy.     Retailers shed 26,000 positions last month after adding about 40,000 in January. But Chewy Inc., a Florida-based online seller of pet supplies, is expanding. It is in the process of hiring an estimated 2,500 new employees over the next 12 months as it expands its operations, including three new warehouse facilities set to open this year.     “Our business is accelerating. We did $900 million in sales in 2016, and we’ll do close to $2 billion this year,” Chief Executive         Ryan Cohen    said. “We need to always be proactive in making sure we have the capacity.” He credited the company’s rapid growth to structural shifts in the economy—customers moving their spending from brick-and-mortar stores to online.                                         Donald Trump has questioned the main unemployment rate, but there are actually six separate measures and each one tells a different story.                                                                                                     The health-care sector added 27,000 jobs in February, but uncertainty over government policies could cloud the outlook. Scripps Health, which operates hospitals and clinics in the San Diego area, hired about 2,200 employees last year and has brought on roughly 950 new employees so far in 2017, mostly to fill existing jobs. As congressional Republicans try to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, however, it may leave more positions open in the coming months.      “We’re doing everything we can to restrain hiring…because of the unknown impact of the new Republican health plan,” said Chief Executive         Chris Van Gorder.    He said no layoffs are planned, but “if I can hold off hiring for a while, I will.”     Despite years of progress, pockets of distress persist across the economy, many of them hard to reverse quickly.      Some 23.8% of America’s 7.5 million unemployed workers have been out of a job for longer than six months, an elevated rate of long-term unemployment, compared with the prerecession years. An additional 5.7 million people are working part-time because they can’t find full-time jobs. And the pace of wage growth, while improved, remains below precrisis levels.
