                                                                                                                                         President-elect Donald Trump is prepared to listen to and understand intelligence information he’s due to receive Friday on alleged election season hacking by Russia, according to Mr. Trump’s spokesman.                                                                                                                                                      “I think he’s prepared to listen and understand how they got to the conclusions they did,” incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”                                                                                                                                                      “The president-elect, I think, has a healthy skepticism of everything, and that’s important,” Mr. Spicer said.                                                                                                                                                                    “He wants to make sure that whatever decisions we make, whether it’s sanctions or actions, that it’s in the country’s best interest,” he said.                                                                                                                              Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified to Congress Thursday he’s confident Russia was behind the campaign season hacks of Democratic officials, but Mr. Trump has consistently been skeptical of Russian involvement.                                                                                                                                                       President Obama was briefed on the matter Thursday, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to get a briefing on Friday. Parts of the classified intelligence report could be made public next week.
