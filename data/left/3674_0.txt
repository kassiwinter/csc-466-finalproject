WASHINGTON – George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump who was sentenced Friday for lying to the FBI, said he recalled then-Sen. Jeff Sessions taking an interest in a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Sessions, now the attorney general, told Congress last fall that he shut down the idea of that summit when Papadopoulos raised it in a meeting in 2016."All I can say is, my recollection differs from Sen. Sessions," Papadopoulos said on ABC’s "This Week.""The campaign was fully aware of what I was doing," Papadopoulos said.Papadopoulos's comments to ABC were the first he has made since being sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to FBI agents about his interactions with a Russian national while working for the Trump campaign. Trump has dismissed Papadopoulos as a low-level campaign aide. Papadopoulos was the first former Trump aide to be sentenced in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Moscow's interference in the 2016 election. Three others have either pleaded guilty or been convicted. Papadopoulos admitted last year that he lied to the FBI about interactions in which people he thought were linked to the Russian government described Moscow having “thousands of emails” containing damaging information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Contributing: Brad Heath
