The Washington Post's editorial board mocked Mitt Romney's tax plan on Sunday."Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican nominee for president, promises to lower everyone’s income tax rate without reducing revenue. This sounds terrific. Why didn’t we think of it sooner?"The editorial, titled 'Mitt Romney's garbage', argued that Romney's plan to cut taxes and lower the deficit is unfeasible."It’s reasonable to assume that his cuts would, as did President Bush’s, worsen the nation’s deficit. Until he’s willing to explain how he would avoid such a result, he has little standing to criticize Mr. Obama’s fiscal shortcomings."The piece also took issue with Romney's claim that his plan to cut taxes by 20% for everyone helps the middle class and not the rich.A recent study found that Romney's plan would mostly benefit the wealthiest Americans. Romney called the findings "garbage.""You can’t simultaneously lower tax rates, take in as much money as before and protect the middle class," the Post editorial board wrote. The editorial echoed comments made by President Obama earlier this month. Obama called Romney's plan "Romney hood... like Robin Hood in reverse."Mitt Romney Campaigns
