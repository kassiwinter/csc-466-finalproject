Senate Republicans will invoke the body’s so-called nuclear option Wednesday and use a simple majority to change the chamber’s rules for confirming many presidential appointees.Democrats opposed a procedural vote on the proposed change Tuesday, prompting Republicans to move to unusual procedural tactics to reduce the amount of time the body takes to process district-court nominees and many executive appointments. The Senate GOP argues that Democrats are abusing Senate procedures to prevent President Trump from staffing his administration. “We’ve got a crisis right now with this attempt to basically keep this administration from functioning,”         Sen. Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.) said Tuesday. Confirming conservative judicial appointees has been a centerpiece of Mr. McConnell’s tenure under Mr. Trump.     The resolution would permanently cut the amount of debate after a nominee clears a cloture vote from 30 hours to two hours. Nominees to circuit courts, the Supreme Court and cabinet-level executive positions are exempt from the proposed change.               The Senate instituted a similar limit on post-cloture debate under then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, but the change was temporary and has since expired.     Democrats have called the latest rules change a power grab that will diminish the Senate’s ability to vet nominees.     “What is this about? It’s about trying to ram things through,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee and a candidate for president. “It’s our job to make sure that the people who are nominated to the most senior positions in our government are competent and qualified.”     But Republicans can move forward with the proposal under the Senate’s “nuclear option” to change the body’s rules with a simple majority. The GOP controls the chamber with 53 members, and the party may move to change the body’s rules as soon as this week.     “Republicans have been very clear that we have the votes to do it ourselves,” said         Sen. James Lankford    (R., Okla.), one of the author’s of the proposed change. “We have 51 votes.”     The average length of the Senate nomination and confirmation process for many positions has grown under the last several administrations and reached record lengths during the Trump administration, according to data kept by the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan organization. The Trump White House has taken longer to select appointees than previous administrations, and the Senate has taken longer to process the nominees.     Republicans contend that both parties will ultimately benefit from the change in procedure in the long run. Mr. McConnell has threatened to deploy the same tactics for delaying the confirmation of appointees when Democrats control the White House, goading Democrats running for president that they have an interest in easing the process.     “If we don’t stop this behavior now, it will become the norm,” Mr. McConnell said.     The process for confirming presidential appointees has been at the center of a procedural arms race between the parties to reduce the minority party’s influence over the chamber.     In 2013, Sen. Reid, as majority leader, used the “nuclear option” to eliminate the filibuster for most executive and judicial appointments, significantly curtailing the ability of the minority party to reject presidential nominations.     Mr. McConnell made a similar move in 2017 when Senate Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. That cleared the way for the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Justice         Neil Gorsuch.    The Senate confirmed Justice         Brett Kavanaugh    in 2018 with 50 votes.     Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com      Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
