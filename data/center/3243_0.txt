The Dow Jones Industrial Average gyrated wildly Tuesday, trading in a range of nearly 1,200 points, as financial markets attempted to regain their footing a day after the index suffered its biggest-ever daily point plunge.The blue-chip index changed direction 29 times over the course of the session before surging in the final hour to close up 567.02 points, or 2.3%, at 24912.77. (Follow live analysis of today’s markets.) Investors struggled to keep pace as volatility returned in force to the stock market. Equity benchmarks from Tokyo to Madrid plunged overnight, and the opening hour of U.S. trading was especially frenetic with the Dow falling as much as 567 points and briefly flirting with correction levels.     Many individuals trying to place orders had trouble accessing their investment accounts, taking to         Twitter    to report outages and slowdowns on the websites of discount brokerages and mutual-fund firms including         TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.        AMTD -0.73%       and Fidelity Investments.          Meanwhile, professional traders from New York to Hong Kong described a sense of lingering unease as major indexes oscillated in choppy trade. An online discussion thread titled “The Dow has lost 1,000 points in two days” on the forum Reddit had generated more than 4,700 comments by Tuesday afternoon.          But some novice investors like Kayleigh Kemper, a 31-year-old stay-at-home mother in Peoria, Ill., rushed to try to scoop up shares at a discount.     “I see the market dropping as an opportunity for those of us who don’t have a chance to play all the time,” said Ms. Kemper, who added $500 to her new account on the stock-trading app Robinhood to buy the         Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.         The Dow’s late-day gain put the index back in positive territory for the year, up 0.8%, and marked its largest jump of the year on a point and percentage basis. It is still down 6.4% from its Jan. 26 high.     The index swung 1,167.49 points from its high to its low on Tuesday. That marked the second-biggest intraday trading range in the Dow’s history. The largest: Monday’s 1,596.65-point swing that ended with the index closing down 1,175.21 points.     The S&P 500, which lost $965.9 billion in market value following Monday’s declines, gained 1.7% on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.        
More on the Market Tumult        While U.S. markets stanched the red ink on Tuesday, losses overseas were steep. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.4%, posting its largest one-day decline since June 2016, shortly after the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 5.1%, or 1,650 points, its biggest point decline since January 2008.     Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index—known as Wall Street’s fear gauge—fell 20% after surging 115.6% Monday in what was its biggest one-day jump on record.     While Tuesday’s turn higher in the U.S. market was welcome to investors, many believed that the sudden onslaught of volatility hadn’t ended. “As the market drips higher, confidence is slowly coming back. But many feel like we aren’t out of the woods yet,” said         Mohit Bajaj,    director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital.     Some investors attributed the choppy trading to lingering nervousness from the abrupt market reversal of previous days and the return of volatility following a period of prolonged market calm.     There was no obvious catalyst for the selloff that began last week, but investors have started to question whether a pickup in inflation will force central banks to tighten monetary policy more than anticipated, posing a risk to the yearslong rally in stocks.

Still, with earnings and global economic growth looking strong, the outlook for the stock market remains positive over the long term, said         Tom Anderson,    chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth.     Meanwhile, several financial advisers—some of whom had geared up to receive a flood of inquiries from clients—said business was calmer than they had anticipated.     “We were expecting the phone to go off the hook,” said Winnie Sun, founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, Calif. “We got a couple of calls, but it wasn’t anything like 2008.”     Ms. Sun and other advisers say they have been preparing clients for a market correction for the past 12 to 18 months, moving more money to cash and engaging in regular conversations about declines as markets notched high after high. Instead of calming worried investors, some advisers said they have been fielding questions about whether now is the time to add to equity holdings.     “We think there will be more chances,” said Danie McHugh, partner at Summit Trail Advisors in New York, who added that she had received calls from clients asking if “this is the 10% pullback we’ve been waiting for.”     Read More:     Streetwise: Will Inflation Eat This Market Alive?
