     President Donald Trump said he believed the leaks coming from his administration are actually "fabricated lies." | Getty President Donald Trump on Sunday morning accused news outlets of fabricating stories and making up sources.
In a series of tweets, the president said he believed the leaks coming from his administration are actually "fabricated lies." "It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media," he tweeted at 8:33 a.m.
He went on to say that the anonymous sources used in articles do not exist.
"Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names .... it is very possible that those sources don't exsist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy," he continued. Several minutes later he rewrote one of the tweets to fix the spelling of "exist."
Trump has been plagued with a series of leaks coming from sources within the White House since his inauguration. This past week, Trump made his first overseas trip â€” a stretch of time in which he did minimal tweeting.Trump also implied that the special election in Montana between Democrat Rob Quist and Republican Greg Gianforte was poorly covered, given that Gianforte won the race.
"Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered," he wrote, presumably meaning "V" for victor. Earlier in the morning, Trump tweeted about that race, saying: "Big win in Montana for Republicans!"
Trump also tweeted Sunday morning about his trip abroad, calling it "a great success for America."
"Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results," he tweeted.
