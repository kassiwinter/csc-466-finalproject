                                                                                                                                         The United States and China unveiled ambitious targets Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gases in an effort by the world’s two biggest carbon dioxide polluters to foster a global agreement on climate change next year.                                                                                                                                                      President Obama said the U.S. would cut its emissions much faster than previously planned, reducing greenhouse gases by anywhere from 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Those are deeper cuts than were planned through 2020, and most of the action would be required after Mr. Obama leaves office in 2017.                                                                                                                                                      In return, Chinese President Xi Jinping didn’t commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. He said China, which is still building coal-burning plants, would set a target of capping its greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Obama said the U.S. goals are “ambitious,” but said the accelerated pace of cuts will improve public health and boost jobs.                                                                                                                              “This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship,” Mr. Obama said. “We have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change.”                                                                                                                                                                 He praised China for agreeing to “slow, peak and then reverse” its carbon emissions eventually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            China also is pledging to get about 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.                                                                                                                              It was unclear how feasible it would be for either country to meet their goals, and Mr. Obama’s pledge was sure to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress.                                                                                                                              The new, accelerated targets for the U.S. are sure to raise objections among congressional Republicans. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has frequently denounced Mr. Obama’s “war on coal” and wants to cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency.                                                                                                                   In a statement after the deal was announced, Mr. McConnell said the new targets agreed to by Mr. Obama are “unrealistic.”                                                                                                                 “Our economy can’t take the president’s ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,” Mr. McConnell said. “This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs.”                      He added, “The president said his policies were on the ballot, and the American people spoke up against them. It’s time for more listening, and less job-destroying red tape. Easing the burden already created by EPA regulations will continue to be a priority for me in the new Congress.”                      Environmental groups praised the deal, saying it would create momentum for a global climate-change pact in Paris next year among nearly 200 nations.                      “It’s a new day to have the leaders of the U.S. and China stand shoulder-to-shoulder and make significant commitments to curb their country’s emissions,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. “They have both clearly acknowledged the mounting threat of climate change and the urgency of action. It’s heartening to see this level of cooperation.”                      It was the first time that China has agreed, at least in principle, to cap its greenhouse gas emissions.                      Mr. Obama said his visit to China produced a “remarkable scope” of agreements with Beijing, including a pact to extend visa limits for Chinese citizens, and an understanding to expand an information technology agreement on the export of electronic goods.                      • This article is based in part on wire-service reports.
