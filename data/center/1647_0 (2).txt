WASHINGTON—         Kayla Jean Mueller,    the last American hostage known to be held by Islamic State extremists, was confirmed dead by her relatives and the White House on Tuesday.Ms. Mueller’s parents received what U.S. officials described as private communications from Islamic State over the weekend, including photographs. Based on the images, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded they proved she had been killed, officials said. However, intelligence officials couldn’t determine how she was killed or when she died, White House press secretary         Josh Earnest    said.     The extremist organization asserted Friday that Ms. Mueller had been killed in a Jordanian airstrike in Syria. But U.S. and Jordanian officials have been skeptical of the claim. U.S. officials said it was impossible to ascertain from the photos whether she had been killed in the recent strikes as the group claimed.

John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.               One U.S. official said militants sent Ms. Mueller’s family three photos showing her face. In two of them, she was wearing a head scarf and, in the third, she appeared to be in a burial shroud. It was clear that she had recently died, but it wasn’t possible to know when the photos were taken.     Her parents, Marsha and Carl Mueller, had held out hope their daughter was alive even after Islamic State announced her death on Friday. But in a statement on Tuesday, they said they had received confirmation of her death.     “We are so proud of the person Kayla was and the work that she did while she was here with us,” Ms. Mueller’s family said, calling her “a compassionate and devoted” humanitarian. “She lived with purpose, and we will work every day to honor her legacy.”     She had been held by Islamic State for 18 months, describing her captivity in a letter that she wrote last spring and that was released by her family Tuesday. Unlike the experiences of other Islamic State hostages, she said in the letter that she hadn’t been physically harmed.     She recounted agony over thoughts of her family’s suffering. “None of us could have known it would be this long,” she wrote, packing a single page of paper with dozens of lines of script. She relied on other captives to deliver the letter to her family when they were freed.                                         Could the death Kayla Jean Mueller, the last American hostage known to be held by ISIS, change the way the U.S. deals with militants? WSJ's Jerry Seib discusses with Tanya Rivero.

As the months dragged on, she clung to hope and wrote a song to buoy her spirits. She asked her family not to be afraid.     During her imprisonment, she tried to teach the guards crafts, said Rev.         Kathleen Day,    a family friend who spoke at a Tuesday news conference by friends and relatives in her hometown of Prescott, Ariz. “Kayla remained Kayla” while a captive, she said, adding Ms. Mueller and other captives told each other stories and taught each other songs.      President         Barack Obama,    in a statement, offered condolences to the Mueller family and vowed to bring those responsible for her death to justice. “Kayla represents what is best about America,” he said. Mr. Obama has spoken with Ms. Mueller’s parents, a family representative and administration officials said.     During Ms. Mueller’s captivity, U.S. intelligence officials had assessed that Islamic State militants didn’t intend to kill her, and believed that she wasn’t in the same mortal danger as the male hostages have been.     “She was not at the same risk,” said a military official. “They have treated their female hostages differently.”     U.S. officials also believe Ms. Mueller was forced to convert to Islam and marry an Islamic State leader, part of the reason why they assessed she wouldn’t be killed.     Mr. Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed News, said Ms. Mueller was among those whom U.S. forces tried but failed to rescue at an oil refinery last July.      After the failed summer raid and the December attempt to rescue Luke Somers, family members of Ms. Mueller told the military and U.S. government that they didn't want a rescue to be attempted, a military official said.

A family representative disputed the account, and said the Muellers weren't opposed to a rescue operation but wanted to be notified before any operation took place. They made the request in the fall and the White House agreed, the representative said.     In the wake of criticism over U.S. handling of hostage situations, the Obama administration has tried to improve communication and coordination with family members. But while concerns of family members are given deference, relatives don’t hold a veto over operations, officials said.      Ms. Mueller, who was 26 years old, traveled to the Turkey-Syria border region in December 2012 to work with aid organizations Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council, according to relatives, to help refugees displaced by the Syrian civil war. She was kidnapped in Aleppo in August 2013.     Dedicated to service work, she previously spent time volunteering in India, Israel and the Palestinian territories, before traveling to the border region.     Administration officials blamed Ms. Mueller’s death on her 18-month-long captivity by Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. “ISIL, and ISIL alone, is the reason Kayla is gone,” Secretary of State         John Kerry    said.     Islamic State extremists at one point asked for a ransom of $6.6 million for her release, according to a person involved in the negotiations, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. Another Islamic State demand was the release of         Afia Siddiqui,    a Pakistani imprisoned in the U.S.     Islamic State killed three other American hostages last year, all men, in beheading videos that were publicly released. The group also beheaded two British hostages, and more recently, two Japanese hostages.     Islamic State, earlier this month, also released a video of a Jordanian pilot who had been taken captive and then burned alive. That video spurred outrage among the U.S.-led coalition’s Arab partners and prompted Jordan to step up airstrikes. United Arab Emirates also recently rejoined the air campaign after a brief hiatus.      Mr. Earnest, the White House press secretary, said at least one other American is being held hostage in Syria, pointing to public reports. The family of         Austin Tice,    a freelance journalist who disappeared near Damascus in 2012, held a news conference in Washington last week to raise awareness about his case and campaign for his return.      It isn’t clear which group is holding Mr. Tice, but his parents said at the news conference that they have received assurances he’s alive and not being held by Islamic State militants.     —Julian E.
