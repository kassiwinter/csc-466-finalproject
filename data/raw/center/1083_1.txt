Stepien worked his way up through the political ranks, serving as former New Jersey Republican Representative Bill Baroni's campaign manager in 2003. In 2008, Stepien worked the presidential campaigns of both former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the late Arizona Senator John McCain.After helping former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie attain office by serving as his campaign manager, Stepien became Christie's political adviser and deputy chief of staff.Christie's administration became embroiled in scandal after it was uncovered that Christie had closed down lanes on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 as retaliation against a local mayor.Mark Sokolich, mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, had declined to give Christie his political endorsement. Christie then began shutting down parts of the bridge during heavy traffic hours, referring to them as "traffic studies."Known as "Bridgegate," the controversy involved the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs which Stepien oversaw. Emails were uncovered in which Stepien referred to Sokolich as an "idiot." Stepien was not indicted in the affair but it was alleged that Stepien was aware of the plan to halt traffic on the bridge.
Kevin Marino, Stepien's attorney during the Bridgegate legal proceedings, denied Stepien's involvement in a 2014 statement. "Bill Stepien was not involved in the origination, the planning, the execution, the concealment of the lane closures," Marino said. "And Mr. Stepien never lied to anyone about anything."Before the Bridgegate case, Stepien had been selected by Christie to be the leader of New Jersey's Republican party. However, Stepien was fired by Christie in 2014. Christie explained by the firing by saying he "lost confidence" in Stepien's judgment.In 2016, Stepien joined Trump's campaign as national field director. He became Trump's deputy assistant and political director in 2017.
