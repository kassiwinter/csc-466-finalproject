And these people led it!” Trump told the newspaper hours after it was announced Brennan's clearance was being revoked.“So I think it’s something that had to be done," he added.Brennan served as CIA director under former President Obama, and was one of the officials who briefed Trump prior to his inauguration on evidence of Russian interference.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a statement from Trump during Wednesday's press briefing that listed several other Obama-era intelligence officials whose clearances are under review.The names included former Director of National Intelligence James ClapperJames Robert ClapperUS intelligence community 'struggled' to brief Trump in 2016, CIA review shows An unquestioning press promotes Rep.
