WASHINGTON—Republicans won't accept further tax increases in coming budget and debt negotiations, the party's Senate leader said Sunday, putting GOP lawmakers on a collision course with Democrats over raising the government's borrowing limit.Congress and President         Barack Obama    last week raised income-tax rates on high earners as part of legislation to avoid the series of spending cuts and broad tax increases known as the fiscal cliff.                                                 Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, above, says new revenue is 'off the table.'          Reuters                                                                                                             "The tax issue is finished, over, completed. That's behind us," Senate Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.) told ABC. He said new tax revenue is "absolutely" off the table as part of any coming negotiations with Democratic lawmakers and Mr. Obama.     Democratic leaders say more revenue is needed, mainly by scaling back tax breaks.               "There are still deductions, credits, special treatments under the tax code that ought to be looked at very carefully," Sen.         Dick Durbin    of Illinois, the Democrats' No. 2 leader in the Senate, said on CNN Sunday.     Mr. McConnell's line in the sand comes as lawmakers prepare to consider the terms for raising the nation's statutory borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, which must be done by late February or early March, one of several impending deadlines on spending matters.          Many conservative House Republicans opposed last week's fiscal-cliff measure, which raised income-tax rates for the first time in almost two decades and contained no long-term spending cuts of any significance. That bill would reduce the deficit by some $620 billion over 10 years, far short of the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that some leaders had hoped to negotiate.     "Now, it's time to pivot and turn to the real issue, which is our spending addiction," Mr. McConnell said Sunday. He said any cuts should target entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which Democrats have been reluctant to cut.     Mr. Obama, in comments at the White House on New Year's Eve, said that "cutting spending has to go hand-in-hand" with tax-law changes "so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans."     Mr. Durbin, in his Sunday appearance on CNN, suggested revisiting, among other things, the ability of taxpayers to "park their money" offshore to avoid U.S. taxes.      Administration officials have said privately that they want further deficit-cutting deals to be composed roughly of half revenue increases and half spending reductions.     Similarly, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Sunday on CBS that the fiscal cliff didn't do enough to raise government revenues and that lawmakers should end certain tax breaks, citing in particular "special subsidies for big oil."     Coming off the elections, Republicans had insisted they would resist any increases in income-tax rates in averting the fiscal cliff. But they wound up yielding to Mr. Obama on this point, agreeing to end the Bush-era tax cuts for couples earning more than $450,000 a year.      House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), in an interview with The Wall Street Journal editorial page to be published Monday, also said the GOP wouldn't agree to any more tax increases in the next two years. "The tax issue is resolved," he said.     Sunday's comments left unclear whether and how lawmakers would proceed with the push toward a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code, a goal backed by Mr. Obama and many lawmakers, including the legislative leaders on tax matters, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R., Mich.) and his Senate counterpart, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D., Mont.).     Many lawmakers hoped that last week's resolution of the fiscal-cliff tax-and-spending issues would free lawmakers to start considering a tax-code overhaul, but other pending fiscal matters are complicating the process.

Lawmakers also must contend with automatic spending cuts known as sequesters due to take effect in March, as a result of last week's fiscal-cliff deal. Many lawmakers say those cuts would hit the Pentagon too hard.      In addition, Congress must pass a measure to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year through Sept. 30 before the existing stopgap legislation expires in late March.     Those deadlines are certain to touch off difficult negotiations and potentially more stalemate in Washington. Republicans in the summer of 2011 used the debt ceiling to push the White House for spending cuts, and they have signaled they would do that again. Mr. Obama has said he won't allow the debt ceiling to again be tied up in the tussle over taxes and spending.     Last week's brinkmanship has left lawmakers in both parties looking for a new model over how to negotiate tough issues. Given more than a year to deal with a Jan. 1 deadline, Congress waited until the last minute to avoid tax-rate increases on nearly all taxpayers and deep spending cuts, acting hours after the tax increases took effect.     Mr. McConnell, who stepped in to help forge the fiscal-cliff compromise with the White House, warned afterward that he doesn't want to play that role again. Both he and Mr. Boehner are saying they want to abandon the practice of conducting high-drama negotiations with Mr. Obama. "These last-minute deals are no way to run government," Mr. McConnell said on ABC.     At the White House, officials also have grown frustrated with the protracted deal-making. They increasingly believe that wariness of Mr. Boehner among his most conservative members has made him an unreliable partner who can't produce the votes needed to push legislation through his chamber.     "It's pretty clear that John Boehner has the office of speaker and the title of speaker, but the notion that somehow he's the leader of the House seems to be over," said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary.     Republicans say it is Mr. Obama who makes for a poor negotiating partner. Aides said the president would talk so much in bargaining sessions that they took to clocking the amount of time he spoke compared with Messrs. Boehner and McConnell. In a couple of phone calls since November, these aides said, Mr. Obama did nearly all of the talking.              Josh Earnest,    a White House spokesman, said that "the president went more than halfway to compromise with Republicans on a grand bargain" to resolve a large number of fiscal issues, but that Republicans didn't offer the same specificity.
