While the Pentagon is pushing for tens of thousands of troops to remain in the country, the White House is likely agree to about 10,000 at most.Regardless of whether the BSA is signed, 2015 is likely to be a difficult year in Afghanistan, the Pakistani official added. Afghan security forces still need a great deal of training, as they have yet to become “a mature fighting machine,” the official said.Without more training in the wake of a US force departure, Afghan troops are likely to desert, the official adds, even as insurgent groups rush in “to fill that vacuum.”
