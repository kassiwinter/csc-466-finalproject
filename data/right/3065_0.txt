           The State Department revoked the visa of a U.S.-born businessman and chief critic of Vladimir Putin after Russia exposed a loophole and unilaterally added him to Interpol's wanted list, The Guardian reported.
Bill Browder has waged an international campaign against Putin over the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died while in Russian custody in 2009 after accusing Russian officials of massive tax fraud. He was beaten to death days before a mandatory release.
Browder's efforts spawned the Magnitsky Act in 2012, aimed at punishing Russian officials responsible for the lawyer's death.
For that, Browder is now the subject of an arrest demand, thanks to Russia, which manipulated a loophole after having been denied by Interpol three times from 2012 to 2015 to issue arrest warrants for Browder, The Guardian reports.
He tweeted: Canada is the latest country moving ahead to adopt the Magnitsky Act.
"Putin is so rattled by the spreading Magnitsky sanctions around the world that he’s ready to run roughshod over all rules and western norms," Browder told The Guardian.
Browder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the summer about Magnitsky and the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) as part of the over-arching Russia investigation.           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
