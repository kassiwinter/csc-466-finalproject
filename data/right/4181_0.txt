Vice President Joe Biden will announce that he is running for president next week, according to multiple reports.The announcement is expected in a video message Wednesday, according to three people with knowledge of his plans. Even though he has not officially launched his campaign Biden has appeared at or near the top of several polls on Democratic candidates. But not all Democrats would be happy if the former VP ended up their party’s nominee."How many of you would like to see Joe Biden get in? Show of hands," CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked the panel of six Democrats, selected from Ohio, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, on "New Day" Tuesday morning.No one raised their hands."His time is done," said Carol Evans, one of the panelists."To be honest, Sen. Biden comes from kind of the good-old-boy politics of the past," added another panelist, Russell Banks."I don't think Joe Biden represents that new thing that we need," a third panelist, Owen Evans, said. "We need a new economy, we need new politics and we need someone different." (CNN)In addition to the lack of enthusiasm for him entering the race from some Democrats, and his age, Biden has faced recent backlash from several women for inappropriate and unwanted touching. “Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it,” Biden said in a video addressing the claims. “I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility, and I’ll meet it.” 
President Trump predicted earlier this week that the Democratic race would come down to Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).“I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)!” he wrote. “I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!”
