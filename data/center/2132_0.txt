Republicans opened a counteroffensive against Democratic claims that Mitt Romney outsourced jobs, highlighting how President Barack Obama's economic-stimulus program ended up sending some U.S. taxpayer money to foreign firms and workers.The issue of sending U.S. jobs overseas has emerged as a major theme of the presidential campaign, with both candidates striving to convince middle-class voters that his opponent poses the greater risk to their economic security.                                         Fearing Democratic attacks on Mitt Romney may be taking a toll, Republicans opened their own offensive on the outsourcing front, highlighting spending within the federal stimulus program in which taxpayer money went to foreign firms and workers.

The former Massachusetts governor labeled as "false and misleading" a series of Obama ads accusing him of profiting from companies that moved jobs abroad when he was a private-equity manager.     "If there's an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him," Mr. Romney said.               The Republican National Committee joined in, unveiling a website intended to spotlight instances when the Obama administration funded projects that ended up awarding work to overseas companies.      Called "Obamanomics Outsourced," the site includes an interactive world map and highlights what Republicans describe as about three dozen cases of spending under the 2009 Recovery Act that rewarded foreign companies and workers. Among them are solar panels built in Mexico, electric delivery trucks assembled in Great Britain and parts used to build U.S. wind-power farms that came from South Korea, Japan and Mexico.      RNC Chairman Reince Priebus flew to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Tuesday to draw attention to the GOP attacks just before President Obama made a campaign appearance at the same community college. "This president has an addiction of sending taxpayer money overseas to companies that are not providing jobs in this country," Mr. Priebus said.          The stimulus legislation contained some restrictions on the use of foreign goods, but they mainly applied to the use of raw materials in highway projects.     The Obama campaign didn't dispute that some stimulus dollars went to buy foreign products, but said the RNC and Romney attacks distort the record of stimulus spending and its positive effect on the U.S. economy.     The new Republican line of attack comes after the Obama campaign has hammered Mr. Romney for weeks with ads in battleground states. Citing a story last month in the Washington Post, the ads accuse Mr. Romney of profiting from investments in companies that shipped jobs overseas during his years as head of Bain Capital, a charge the Romney campaign has dismissed as false.     Mr. Obama himself has called Mr. Romney "an outsourcing pioneer," while his top campaign aide, David Axelrod, first used the "outsourcer-in-chief" line against Mr. Romney last month.     Romney aides and many GOP officials have expressed worries that the ads could weaken Mr. Romney in the eyes of swing voters in industrial states.     Polls have been mixed on whether voters see Mr. Romney's business experience as an asset. But a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that voters in swing states viewed his Bain resume far more negatively than positively—the result, possibly, of the Obama ads that have pounded Mr. Romney on the issue in states such as Iowa, Ohio, Colorado and Virginia.     The Obama campaign hasn't backed off the outsourcing charges. It released a new ad this week claiming Mr. Romney "made a fortune" sending U.S. jobs to China and other countries. "Mitt Romney is not the solution. He is the problem," the ad says.     The new RNC website cites numerous examples of U.S. spending that it says benefited firms abroad. But in some instances, the cases are more complicated than the site suggests.     One involves a $151 million federal grant that went to help set up a lithium-ion battery plant for electric cars called LG Chem Michigan Inc. in Holland, Mich. The company is a subsidiary of LG Chem Ltd. of South Korea.      A local labor union said that workers saw Koreans taking part in the plant construction. They complained that local workers were being sidelined in favor of Korean nationals on a project underwritten by U.S. taxpayers. The RNC website says this was "work that Americans easily could have done."     But Randy Boileau, a spokesman for LG Chem, said the company "didn't ask people to come over and perform general-contracting labor or craft work. These were highly technical people who were there to assist in the transfer of the [battery] technology.'' During construction, no more than 10 to 12 Koreans were on the job, he said.     Department of Energy spokeswoman Jen Stutsman said the plant is "an illustration of in-sourcing in action." The department's grants, she said, "spurred international companies to move manufacturing plants to the U.S., where they trained and hired hundreds of U.S. workers."
