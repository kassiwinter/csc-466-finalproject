The Senate Wednesday sent another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis; Trump signed it into law hours later.But, all sides have agreed that the government needed to pass a third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide have been stuck home.TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A ‘WARTIME PRESIDENT’ OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACTThe administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require "limits on increases in executive pay" until the loans are repaid.The proposal calls for $150 billion to "other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy" through secured lending or loan guarantees.Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all "prime candidates" for support.The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.The administration would create a "small business interruption loan program" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has taken the lead on negotiations with Congress on the coronavirus response.
