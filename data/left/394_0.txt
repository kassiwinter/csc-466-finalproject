An investigation into a fatal gun battle at a Jersey City kosher market Tuesday afternoon has made it “clear” that it was targeted attack, according to Mayor Steven Fulop. The mayor wrote on Twitter late Tuesday that the shootout that left a police officer, three passersby, and the two suspects dead was deliberately started at a Jewish grocery in the Greenville neighborhood of Jersey City. “Based on our initial investigation (which is ongoing) we now believe the active shooters targeted the location they attacked,” Fulop wrote. He added on Wednesday morning that, after a review of CCTV footage, “it has now become clear from the cameras that these two individuals targeted the Kosher grocery location.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed what appears to be blatant targeting. “This tragically confirms that a growing pattern of violent anti-Semitism has now turned into a crisis for our nation,” he wrote on Twitter. “And now this threat has reached the doorstep of New York City.”Read it at NJ.com
