President         Barack Obama    on Wednesday said Americans who are losing insurance under the health law would find better coverage, rebutting a rising chorus of complaints that he had oversold the law's benefits.With Republican criticism in Congress intensifying over canceled policies and the new online insurance marketplaces malfunctioning, Mr. Obama used a speech in Boston to tell Americans that they could obtain improved insurance if they shopped around. This comes after the president has long said that people who like their health plans would be able to keep them after the new law takes effect next year.

"So, if you're getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace," the president said. For most people, "you're going to get a better deal."               In his speech, Mr. Obama added caveats to his broad promise that people could keep their current coverage: "For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it." He acknowledged that some people would need to obtain new plans and that a fraction of Americans would pay more but get more comprehensive coverage.     The president's comments came hours after the top official in charge of the law's rollout, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, apologized in congressional testimony for the HealthCare.gov website's problems. "You deserve better," she told Americans, adding that she was committed to getting the site fully functioning by the end of November.           Find Your State's Health-Insurance Exchange           Republicans at the hearing repeatedly raised the health-insurance cancellation notices. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which held the hearing, said people who are losing their policies "may be losing their faith" in government.     Democrats defended the health law in language similar to Mr. Obama's, saying the issue affected only a sliver of Americans who already buy insurance on their own and who had plans that left them vulnerable to high out-of-pocket costs. "Insurance companies are canceling lousy policies with high prices," said Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.).     The wrangling has a long history. In 2009, while the law was being debated in Congress, Republicans were quick to say that the president might be overpromising. That August, Mr. Obama devoted one of his weekly addresses to the health legislation, saying, "If you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan. Period."     In that week's Republican address, Rep.         Tom Price    of Georgia suggested the president was playing "fast and loose with the facts."     "If you read the bill, that just isn't so," Mr. Price said.     During several public appearances, the president has offered an emphatic guarantee. "No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people," he told the American Medical Association in 2009. "If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what."

They surfaced occasionally on the campaign trail last year, and Mrs. Sebelius repeated them in a speech at the 2012 Democratic convention.     This year, when the White House marked the third anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama said again that people who like their plans could keep them.     Now, the White House is saying Mr. Obama's assurances applied mostly to people who obtained insurance through their employers. On rare occasions he has offered such qualified promises, saying in a 2008 presidential debate, when he was envisioning a health-care overhaul, that "if you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan."          Cancellation notices are going largely to people who buy insurance plans in the individual market. The health law sets standards for which benefits insurance plans must include, and some policies don't comply. For instance, the law says insurance plans must offer certain preventive care with no co-payments.     Insurers can continue to offer existing customers policies that don't comply with the standards—provided those policies existed before March 2010. But many insurers are canceling the older policies, sometimes because they are no longer profitable or would die out anyway in the absence of new customers.     White House spokesman Jay Carney noted this on Tuesday, saying that "the president was clear" that people buying insurance in the individual market could keep their plans "if you wanted it, and it was available." At the same time, administration officials have said, the law intentionally induces insurers to replace some plans with those offering more comprehensive coverage.     About 15.4 million people, or about 5% of the U.S. population, are covered under individual health plans, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. As many as 10 million consumers are expected to have their health plans terminated by their insurers by year-end, industry experts have said.     Dallas Salisbury, president and chief executive of the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, said that when Mr. Obama declared in 2009 that people could keep their coverage, "my reaction was: Why would they say something so stupid?"

A more accurate pledge, Mr. Salisbury said, albeit one that would have been wordier: Anybody that has an insurance policy that meets the minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act can keep their plan.     John Podesta, who served as White House chief of staff under former President Bill Clinton, said Mr. Obama's earlier comments would be forgotten once HealthCare.gov is fully functional     "The question comes back to getting these markets workable and working. Then, this will fade as an issue," said Mr. Podesta, who was co-chairman of Mr. Obama's 2008 transition team.     Mr. Obama delivered his remarks Wednesday in Boston's Faneuil Hall, where in 2006, then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed into law an overhaul of the state's health-care system. Mr. Obama pointed to the Massachusetts law as a model for the federal law.      Like the federal health law, lawmakers and others thought the Massachusetts law was doomed to fail, Mr. Obama said. "All the parade of horribles, the worst predictions about health-care reform in Massachusetts never came true," he said.
