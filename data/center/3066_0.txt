The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a decision by Puerto Rico’s power authority to award a $300 million contract to a tiny Montana energy firm to rebuild electrical infrastructure damaged in Hurricane Maria, according to people familiar with the matter.Agents from the FBI’s San Juan field office are looking into circumstances surrounding the deal that the public power monopoly known as Prepa signed with Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC, according to the people familiar with the matter. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló canceled the contract Sunday, saying it had become a distraction from the U.S. territory’s efforts to restore the devastated grid. Only 30% of the island’s power customers have had electricity restored.     The Federal Emergency Management Agency, multiple congressional committees and local auditors also have raised concerns and begun requesting documents about the deal.               “Whitefish is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation,” a company spokesman said Monday. “The procurement of the PREPA contract was at all times fully appropriate.”     A spokeswoman for Gov. Rosselló said he “welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: there should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”     A spokesman for the FBI field office couldn’t be reached.     The House Committee on Natural Resources said Monday it would hold hearings over the next three weeks on the storm recovery and on transparency in the reconstruction process.     Ricardo Ramos, executive director of Prepa, had defended the Whitefish pick and said the contracting process was done according to the utility’s regulations for handling emergency situations.     Whitefish, a startup firm based in the remote hometown of Interior Secretary         Ryan Zinke,    had roughly 350 subcontracted workers and 2,500 tons of heavy equipment on the ground for restoring electrical lines destroyed in the Category-4 hurricane. But the firm’s small size and limited track record, as well as the terms of the contract, ignited concerns around Puerto Rico’s management of the flow of federal disaster-relief dollars to the island.     Mr. Zinke, an acquaintance of Whitefish Chief Executive Andy Techmanski, issued a statement last week denying he had any involvement in the company securing the deal.     On Friday, FEMA said it had questions about how Whitefish’s prices were negotiated and was working with Prepa and its legal advisers to determine how the contract was procured as well as how the utility determined the prices.      The Whitefish controversy now threatens to cost Puerto Rico’s governor control of the power utility, which this summer entered a court-supervised bankruptcy proceeding. He is vying for control of Prepa with the federal oversight board installed by Congress to supervise Puerto Rico’s economic planning. The oversight board last week took steps last week to install a retired Air Force colonel as a “chief transformation officer” to take over Prepa’s operations.     The governor said he would oppose the change and that management of public corporations such as Prepa should rest exclusively with local officials appointed under Puerto Rican law. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy process is expected to decide who should be in charge.     A committee representing Puerto Rico creditors petitioned the court Monday to take depositions and obtain documents surrounding the “questionable nature” of the Whitefish deal.     The Whitefish contract had terms that precluded government agencies from auditing certain profit and cost elements and provided compensation for linemen that critics on the island said were in excess of typical rates, even considering the rugged working conditions in remote regions of Puerto Rico.     Whitefish has defended its work and said that without its quick arrival to the island, utility crews would only now be getting there to begin restoration work.     Mr. Rosselló said Sunday he would reactivate mutual aid agreements with utilities from Florida and New York that Prepa initially chose not to tap after the storm in favor of private contractors.     A Whitefish spokesman said Sunday it was “very disappointed” by the governor’s decision to shred the contract, arguing that bringing in replacement brigades would only delay restoring power to the majority of Prepa customers who still lack service.     FEMA said Friday it hadn’t confirmed whether it considered Whitefish’s prices to be reasonable and hadn’t yet provided any reimbursement for the contract. FEMA said it hadn’t authorized Whitefish’s payment terms, despite language in the contract stating the terms had been approved for reimbursement by the agency.     Mr. Ramos told The Wall Street Journal the language should have been removed from the contract but was left in by mistake.     “That’s civil fraud without any doubt,” said John Mudd, a Puerto Rico-based attorney who represents government contractors in court proceedings. “If the contract is canceled and these people are not paid,” he said. “They can claim that they were defrauded.”     Prepa based its decision on the contract rates, the time it would take for crews to mobilize and the fact that Whitefish didn’t require a large upfront payment, Mr. Ramos said. He said that to his knowledge there was no outside influence on his procurement department and that Prepa structured the deal so money would be released in tranches of between $1 million and $3 million as work was completed.     But Mr. Ramos also acknowledged that the contracting process was rushed due to the emergency circumstances and that Prepa didn’t receive certain protections, including a performance bond.     If FEMA determines the contract to be non-reimbursable for failing to comply with agency requirements, Prepa could be stuck with the bill for a month’s worth of work by Whitefish, Mr. Mudd said.     The controversy “certainly will chill some people’s opinions” about doing business with Puerto Rico or investing capital on the island, said Tom Lewis, president of U.S. operations at Louis Berger Group, an engineering firm involved in the hurricane recovery. “Credibility matters, not just to Washington D.C. but also to the private sector, which will have to play a role.”     Whitefish signed a deal framework on Sept. 26, less than a week after Maria made landfall. It was amended on Oct. 17, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.     In an Oct. 21 letter seeking assistance from Florida Gov.         Rick Scott,    Mr. Rossello said that “restoring electricity to our citizens has become a daunting task, mainly because of the lack of liquidity of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.”      Mr. Scott, a Republican, said Monday he will lead a delegation of the state’s utility providers to the island Friday.
