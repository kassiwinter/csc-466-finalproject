WASHINGTON—White House chief of staff         John Kelly    will leave his job “toward the end of the year,” President Trump said Saturday, part of a broad shake-up as the White House girds for a re-election bid and clashes with congressional Democrats.The president will announce Mr. Kelly’s replacement on Monday, a White House official said on Saturday. The new chief of staff will be the third to hold the position in less than two years, reflecting an extraordinary level of turnover in the White House’s senior ranks. Nick Ayers, Vice President      Mike Pence’s        top aide and a longtime Republican political operative, is the likely replacement for Mr. Kelly, the White House official said.

Mr. Trump has indicated he would like Mr. Ayers to make a longer commitment. The negotiations over the terms of Mr. Ayers’s appointment are continuing.          Before departing for the Army-Navy football game, taking place in Philadelphia, the president described Mr. Kelly, a former Marine Corps general, as “a great guy.” Mr. Trump, in his comments to reporters, didn’t give a reason for Mr. Kelly’s departure. The two men spoke Friday about the move, the White House official said.     Mr. Trump told reporters that Mr. Kelly would be “leaving” this month, adding “I don’t know if I can say ‘retiring.’”     “He’s been with me almost two years now,” Mr. Trump said.     Mr. Kelly took Friday off, yet showed up for a dinner at the White House hosted by Mr. Trump and first lady         Melania Trump    for various senior White House aides, White House officials said. There was no mention of Mr. Kelly’s job status, they said, adding that the president praised Mr. Kelly at the dinner.     The move comes less than five months after the White House said Mr. Kelly would stay in the job through the 2020 election. That agreement quashed speculation about Mr. Kelly’s future for a time, but did little to resolve the underlying tensions in what has been a rocky relationship between Mr. Kelly and the president.     Mr. Trump has privately told associates that he never committed to the 2020 timetable.          Mr. Kelly brought a top-down, chain-of-command style to perhaps the most freewheeling West Wing in modern presidential history. Mr. Trump chafed at a structure he complained left him isolated, while Mr. Kelly fumed over Mr. Trump’s efforts to subvert the new protocols.     Mr. Kelly’s imminent departure adds to a record-setting level of churn at the highest levels of the White House. An analysis by the Brookings Institution in October showed that turnover among senior staff stood at 83%, higher than any of Mr. Trump’s five predecessors.     When top aides have left in the past, some of their subordinates followed them out the door, creating a domino effect that is expected to play out with Mr. Kelly’s departure. For instance, Mr. Kelly threw a protective cloak around         Kirstjen Nielsen,    the secretary of Homeland Security, who has been at odds with Mr. Trump for months. The president has criticized Ms. Nielsen for not taking a tougher stance on border security.     Mr. Kelly’s departure would cap a tumultuous tenure that began in July 2017 when the president abruptly removed his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, a former head of the Republican National Committee.     Mr. Kelly had impressed the president as his first Homeland Security secretary. Mr. Kelly came in with a mandate to impose discipline in what many viewed as a freewheeling White House, where Mr. Trump signed executive orders that hadn’t been fully vetted and held court while aides and advisers rolled through the Oval Office at will. “A s---show” is how one senior adviser described it.     At first, the new protocols seemed effective. Mr. Kelly imposed new controls over the flow of information that came to the Oval Office and access to Mr. Trump. Even the president’s son-in-law,         Jared Kushner,    and daughter         Ivanka Trump,    both senior White House advisers, began reporting to Mr. Kelly, rather than directly to the president.     He removed controversial aides, including Steve Bannon, the president’s chief strategist and top 2016 campaign aide, and         Anthony Scaramucci,    who lasted just 10 days as communications director.        
Related        At times the president marginalized Mr. Kelly, ordering aides to carry out tasks without telling him. Some friends took to calling Mrs. Trump and asking her to pass messages to her husband, according to two people familiar with the matter.     Any chief of staff is likely to have a tough time of it under President Trump, said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers,” a book about White House chiefs of staff.     “It’s almost mission impossible unless and until Trump figures out that he needs to have a White House chief of staff who can tell him what he does not want to hear,” Mr. Whipple said. “And there’s no evidence so far that Trump wants that kind of person in the job.”     Mr. Ayers’s ambition and advocacy for Mr. Pence’s interests have made him a polarizing figure within the West Wing, and could accelerate the departure of other White House officials, according to people familiar with the matter. The 36-year-old would bring more than a decade of political experience to the job. He is worth $12.2 million to $54.8 million due largely to his consulting work, according to a financial disclosure last year.      He is close to Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who often clashed with Mr. Kelly’s command-and-control style. But other aides have raised questions with colleagues about whether Mr. Ayers’s actions have, at times, benefited Mr. Pence instead of the president.     Mr. Trump has told advisers that he believed Mr. Ayers was the best fit for the job and that the hand-wringing was part of a natural tension between staffs for the president and his No. 2.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump had signaled a shake-up would be coming, and he made several moves Friday. He announced he would nominate         William Barr    to be his attorney general and said he would nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert for the United Nations ambassador job.     Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he would name Gen. Mark Milley, the Army chief of staff, as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.     The shake-up comes as Mr. Trump faces new challenges next year, with Democrats taking over the House and promising investigations of his business dealings and actions as president.
