  	President Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch is issuing a strong statement about a shooting in a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic last week.
The Attorney General denounces the shooting as “a crime against women.” “This unconscionable attack was not only a crime against the Colorado Springs community, but a crime against women receiving healthcare services at Planned Parenthood, law enforcement seeking to protect and serve, and other innocent people,” she said in a statement.
She also alluded to the attack as an act of terror, pointing out that it was “an assault on the rule of law, and an attack on all Americans’ right to safety and security.”
Planned Parenthood and its supporters were quick to blame the videos released this summer exposing their bartering over aborted baby body parts.
“We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country,” the organization said in a statement shortly after the attack. “We will never back away from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that millions of people rely on and trust.”
According to reports, the shooter mentioned “baby parts” in interviews with local law enforcement after he was taken into custody.
