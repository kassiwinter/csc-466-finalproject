In a letter sent to the White House on Tuesday, Pelosi touted Biden's "historic and transformative leadership" and praised him for, in her words, turning his campaign pledge of "help is on the way" into "help is here" governing.            BIDEN AND CEOS ARE ODD BEDFELLOWS IN VOTING DISPUTE WITH STATES      “In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Wednesday, April 28, to share your vision for addressing the challenges and opportunities of this historic moment," Pelosi wrote.      Biden quickly responded to the invite.      “The President has accepted the invitation of the Speaker of the House to address a Joint Session of Congress on April 28, the night before his 100th day in office," a White House official said Tuesday evening.      The annual event, which is called the State of the Union from a president's second year on, provides a platform for the commander in chief to lay out an agenda, selling it to both lawmakers and the public.      "I promise you, we will have something to sell in the speech, and we will use it for that — for that opportunity," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week.      Biden's "American Jobs Plan," a $2.25 trillion jobs and infrastructure package, will likely be mentioned, as will his yet-to-be-released "American Families Plan," anticipated to propose funding for a raft of social welfare programs. The address also coincides with Congress's appropriations process, with Biden publishing his initial $1.5 trillion budget request last week.
