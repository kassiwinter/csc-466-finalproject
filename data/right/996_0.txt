                                                                                                                                         Seeking to dent President Obama’s refusal to chip away at the  government shutdown piece-by-piece, House Republicans passed a bill  Saturday to guarantee all federal employees get paid after the  government shutdown — including those who have been sent home and  aren’t on the job.                                                                                                                                                      The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Virginia Reps.  James P. Moran, a Democrat, and Frank Wolf, a Republican, cleared  without opposition on a 407-0 vote, marking a major bipartisan  breakthrough. The bill, which the Senate was not expected to take up  this weekend,  would ensure that hundreds of thousands furloughed  government workers  receive full back pay after lawmakers strike a deal  to reopen the  federal government.                                                                                                                                                      “It’s encouraging to see both  parties come together to provide fairness for the 800,000 federal  workers hurt by this shutdown,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner,  Ohio Republican. “Now we should do something about the 800,000 jobs  being destroyed by the president’s health care law. That’s why  Republicans are working every day to reopen the government and provide  fairness for all.”                                                                                                                                                                    Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded by  calling on Mr. Boehner to  let the House vote on the stopgap spending  measure, which passed out of the Senate and would fund government  operations and Obamacare through the middle of November.                                                                                                                              “A  piecemeal approach of funding the government bit by bit is simply not  the answer and saying, ‘We are going to pay you when we reopen this  place’ - that is not the answer,” Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, said on  the floor of the Senate. “No matter how many bites Republicans take at  the apple there is only one bill that ensures that every federal  priority is met - the Senate bill that would fully reopen the federal  government.”                                                                                                                                                                 On Friday the White House, which has issued veto  threats of nearly every other shutdown bill the GOP has written, sent  out a policy statement enthusiastically backing the federal employees  bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced Saturday that it was  ordering most of its 400,000 civilian employees who had been  furloughed as a result of the government shutdown to return back to  work at the beginning of next week.                                                                                                                              Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel  said in a statement that the Pay Our  Military Act that Congress passed last week allows him to “eliminate  furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale,  well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.”                                                                                                                              “I expect us to be able to significantly reduce — but not eliminate — civilian furloughs under this process,” Mr. Hagel said.                                                                                                                   Back  on Capitol Hill Saturday, the House and Senate met as the government  shutdown entered its fifth day, and the sides remained far apart over  the funding of government operations and Obamacare.                                                                                                                 “Today  is day five of a shutdown created by the tea party extremists who are  harming out country by holding out government hostage,” said Rep.  Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat. “They are placing our economy and  our national security in jeopardy by waging an ideological war to  overturn the law of the land and put insurance companies back in charge  of health care decision for tens of millions of our fellow Americans.”                      Democrats have insisted that either the entire government is funded or  none of it will be. Republicans have countered by writing bills to fund  specific high-profile programs such as the National Institutes of  Health, the national parks and some social services.                      Those bills  have won a smattering of Democratic support in the House, but Mr. Obama  and Senate Democrats have rejected the piecemeal strategy, saying they will not pick and choose among favored programs.                      Passing the  federal employees bill would not break that vow, since it won’t put any  workers back on the job, but merely ensure everyone gets paid. All  workers were paid after the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns, too.                      Republicans said it was striking that Mr. Obama has vowed to veto bills  funding veterans’ services, the National Institutes of Health and the  nation’s national parks, even as he said he’ll sign the federal  employees bill.                      “The House has approved 15 different options to fund the government, sent them over to the Senate, but sadly the only response is a loud  snore,” said Rep. Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who heads the  House Appropriations Committee.
