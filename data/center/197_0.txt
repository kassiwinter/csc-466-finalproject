WASHINGTON—President Trump asked his acting chief of staff to place a hold on $391 million in aid to Ukraine more than a week before a July phone call in which he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate      Joe Biden’s        son, according to a person familiar with the matter, a revelation that comes as an investigation into the president’s dealings with Kiev is mushrooming on Capitol Hill. Congress had approved sending military aid to Ukraine to help the country defend against Russian aggression. But Mr. Trump and his advisers, including then-national security adviser         John Bolton    and Defense Secretary         Mark Esper,    began discussing in June the prospect of putting a hold on the funds while the administration reviewed them, a senior administration official said.      In July, Mr. Trump directed acting White House chief of staff         Mick Mulvaney    to do just that, and the decision was passed along to lower-level officials during a July 18 meeting, according to the official. The Washington Post first reported the news of the president’s directive to Mr. Mulvaney.      The official said the request reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing. The Pentagon has long been in favor of pressing forward on military aid.                Another administration official said the reasons given internally for the decision to hold up the funds were the lack of support from other countries to Ukraine and concerns about corruption in the country. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to corruption in Ukraine in his calls for an investigation of Mr. Biden in recent days.     On Tuesday, Mr. Trump defended withholding aid, saying it was out of frustration with the level of support provided by other countries. In comments to reporters at the United Nations, Mr. Trump said: “The [Ukraine] funds were paid, fully paid, but my complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again and I’ll continue to withhold, until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine.”      The EU has provided more than €15 billion ($16.5 billion) in loans and assistance to Ukraine since 2014.     That Mr. Trump had already directed a review of military aid to Ukraine when he asked the country’s president to investigate his potential political opponent is likely to intensify investigations in Congress into the connection between those two actions.     On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested a link between his delay of military aid to Ukraine and what he said were concerns about corruption in the country, but he denied threatening to withhold the support if Kiev didn’t pursue an investigation of Mr. Biden, his potential 2020 opponent.     “It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Mr. Trump said at a United Nations event. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”     Later in the day, he said he didn’t draw that connection in his call with the president of Ukraine. “I did not make a statement that you have to do this or I won’t give you aid,” he said. “I didn’t put any pressure on them whatsoever.” But, he added: “I think it would probably, possibly have been OK if I did.”        
Related Coverage        On July 25, Mr. Trump in a phone call urged Ukrainian President         Volodymyr Zelensky    to work with his lawyer,         Rudy Giuliani,    on a probe that would produce information about Mr. Biden and his son, The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr. Giuliani had met with an official from the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office the previous month to discuss such a probe.     Messrs. Trump and Giuliani have pressed for an inquiry into Mr. Biden’s anticorruption efforts in Ukraine while he was vice president and while his son Hunter Biden had business interests there. Ukraine’s prosecutor general at the time said earlier this year he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son. On Saturday, Joe Biden said he had never discussed with his son any overseas business dealings and accused Mr. Trump of abusing his office.     The administration’s reason for putting a hold on the Ukraine funds—which for weeks this summer proved elusive to lawmakers who were eager for answers—is at the center of the expanding investigation on Capitol Hill into whether there was any connection between the review of foreign aid and efforts by the president and Mr. Giuliani to urge Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden. The examination of Mr. Trump’s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart is likely to escalate this week as Congress continues to probe a whistleblower complaint concerning Mr. Trump, an aspect of which involves the Ukraine call, according to a person familiar with the matter.           Ukrainian officials earlier this month expressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure. “They worried the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness at the time to investigate the Bidens,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), who earlier this month met in Ukraine with Mr. Zelensky and other officials.     The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington didn’t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Murphy’s remarks.     On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to launch an investigation touching on who directed the suspension of aid, saying it should be part of a broader probe. Mr. McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor, said he urged the administration to release its hold on the aid “throughout July, August and early September,” adding that he twice urged Mr. Esper to do so and made a similar plea to Secretary of State         Mike Pompeo.         The Democratic chairmen of the House foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees also sent a letter to Mr. Pompeo threatening to issue a subpoena if the department didn’t begin turning over related documents. The State Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.     For weeks, as lawmakers lobbied Mr. Trump to release the Ukraine money personally and called officials across his administration, they kept getting shifting responses, according to multiple interviews over the past few weeks.     Mr. Trump himself told some lawmakers that other countries weren’t spending enough to bolster Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Monday, Mr. Trump reiterated that complaint.      Others in the administration offered different explanations. On Sept. 3, Vice President      Mike Pence,        who had met a day earlier with Mr. Zelensky, said that in the meeting, “as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”     That day, a bipartisan group of senators in a letter to Mr. Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget said the funding was “crucial to the long term stability of Ukraine” and urged them to immediately release the funds.     Senate Foreign Relations Committee members were also receiving muddled answers. “There was a lot of consternation about why this was held up and what was going on,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), a member of the panel. “I don’t remember ever hearing a clear response about what the holdup was.”     Fed up, senators coalesced around an amendment that Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) had sought to attach to a fiscal 2020 defense-spending bill to force the release of funds to Ukraine. The day before the Senate Appropriations Committee was scheduled to vote, the White House released $250 million in military aid, along with $141 million in State Department funds.     Democrats are now raising questions about whether the president successfully enlisted others in the Trump administration to carry out the pressure campaign on Ukraine. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine told Mr. Murphy earlier this month that it wasn’t involved in demanding the Ukrainian president mount an investigation, a statement that Mr. Murphy took as a sign that diplomats had refused to get involved because they believed such conduct was improper.     —Courtney McBride contributed to this article.
