No Republican voted yes.Because of the tie vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to take procedural steps to bring it to the full Senate for debate and a vote, according to committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Democrat.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comUnder current Senate procedures, Republicans in the 100-member Senate can block passage of a bill unless at least 10 of them vote with Democrats in support of it, an unlikely outcome.Among the bill's provisions are requirements that states expand mail-in voting, which was used widely in last year's presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic. It also would lengthen the hours of in-person balloting.With scores of amendments offered, the nine Democrats and nine Republicans deadlocked on most, leading to their defeat.The panel did, however, approve a Republican amendment prohibiting voting rights for anyone convicted of crimes against children.The unusual appearance of the Senate's top Democratic and Republican leaders at the committee's work session underscored the stakes, with the legislation being advanced as the November 2022 congressional elections come into focus."The bill before this committee has a very simple premise: make it easier, not harder, to vote," Schumer said.Voting rights activists gather during a protest against Texas legislators who are advancing a slew of new voting restrictions in Austin, Texas, U.S., May 8, 2021.

Multiple courts and state and federal election officials rejected Trump's claim last year.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the Democrats' bill represented nothing more than a power grab."This legislation would let Washington Democrats dictate the terms of their own re-election races by rewriting all 50 statesâ€™ election laws," McConnell said.He zeroed in on provisions he said would foster fraudulent elections by loosening voter identification laws and allowing people to collect and turn in other voters' ballots, such as for those in remote locations or in nursing homes.Last week, Florida enacted new limits on voting by mail and using ballot drop boxes.
