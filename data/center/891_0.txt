WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    backed away from his long-standing call for raising tax rates on households making more than $250,000 a year, a development that inches the White House and congressional Republicans closer to a budget deal.Mr. Obama's move, a counter to Republicans' recent proposal to raise tax rates on income over $1 million, further narrows the differences between the two sides. During a meeting with House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) Monday the president proposed allowing Bush-era tax rates to expire for households making more than $400,000 in annual income, people familiar with the meeting said. After weeks of public sniping, negotiations have intensified in recent days, with both sides making significant concessions. Obstacles still remain, especially the reaction of lawmakers on both extremes, but the movement suggests negotiators could reach a compromise and pass by the end of the year a deal to avert a series of spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect in January.      Aides to Mr. Boehner called the offer "a step in the right direction" but said it asks for too much tax revenue and not enough spending cuts. "We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem," said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck.                The White House offer marks a major shift for the president—Mr. Obama since his first run for the White House has campaigned to allow Bush-era tax rates to expire for households making above $250,000—and raises the question of whether he will be able to sell such a deal to his own party.     As part of the offer, the president lowered the amount of tax revenue he is seeking in a deal from $1.4 trillion to $1.2 trillion. He also agreed to accept a GOP proposal to slow Social Security growth by using a different inflation formula to calculate cost-of-living increases, people familiar with the matter said.     One potential stumbling block is a White House request to raise the nation's borrowing limit for two years, something Republicans are likely to oppose. Mr. Obama's offer also calls for increased spending for infrastructure, a temporary extension of unemployment insurance benefits and a permanent extension of other tax breaks that expire at the end of the year.     The president's offer notably didn't include a Republican proposal to increase the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, an idea opposed by many Democrats. And to blunt Democratic resistance to changing the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, his plan would include protections for beneficiaries of the program deemed "most vulnerable," people familiar with the talks said.      Another notable change in the White House's newest offer was the removal of a push to extend the payroll tax cut. The change means the amount of tax paid by virtually all earners next year will increase. A temporary payroll tax cut had been in place the past two years in an effort to help boost the economy, and it expires Dec. 31.     A Democratic official familiar with the talks said Mr. Obama's offer could pass the Senate but would still be a "tough sell'' within the party because of the Social Security proposal and the retreat from the $250,000 income threshold on tax increases.     The White House offer caps several days that have seen major retreats on both sides—Mr. Boehner's offer to raise tax rates and Mr. Obama's abandoning his $250,000 income threshold. So far neither side has seen a significant break in ranks, suggesting at least for now lawmakers are willing to follow their leaders.     Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.) said he and most other Republicans would likely follow Mr. Boehner in accepting higher tax rates if Democrats committed to overhauling safety-net programs in a serious way.     "When I heard about [the latest GOP offer], it felt for the first time in a long time like there might be a light at the end of the tunnel regarding how we do business up here," Mr. Rooney said.     Mr. Obama will have to convince Democrats to swallow such cuts. Mr. Boehner, meanwhile, will have to prevent his conservative rank and file from rebelling against his decision to go along with a rate increase and also allow the debt limit to rise.     "I won't support a deal that raises taxes because it makes the economy worse," Steve Scalise (R., La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, made up of conservative House Republicans, "But I have yet to see any formal plan."     Senior White House officials have been reaching out to liberals, for whom entitlement cuts could be as painful as tax increases are to conservatives, and Mr. Obama has checked in with Democratic congressional leaders as his talks with Mr. Boehner progress.     Many Democrats have opposed proposals to curb the growth of Social Security benefits. "The Republican plan to cut the Social Security benefits of millions of seniors in order to protect tax breaks for the richest 2% in America is neither fair nor balanced,'' said California Rep. Xavier Becerra, a member of the House Democratic leadership.     Spending on a number of government programs automatically increases with inflation. By reworking the way inflation is measured in a more conservative manner, the proposal would slow the growth of future spending on Social Security and other programs.      White House officials believe their new offer represents $1.2 trillion in new taxes and $1.22 trillion in spending reductions over 10 years, a ratio they say meets the balance target Mr. Obama set out during the campaign.      —Naftali Bendavid and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.
