 
Vice President Joe Biden addressed the NAACP Convention today in Houston and according to the National Journal.....hardly anybody cared to show up to hear him talk, at the beginning of his remarks anyway.  Rain is being blamed for low attendance.  Rain may have been a valid excuse if the majority of NAACP convention attendees weren't staying right down the street, a seven minute walk or three minute drive, from the George R. Brown convention center at the Four Seasons Hotel.
