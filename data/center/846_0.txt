On Wednesday Education Secretary Betsy DeVosBetsy DeVosEducation Department revamps College Scorecard Why a few dozen zip codes dominate political giving Jury finds Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four counts MORE issued final rules on how all schools will address allegations of sexual misconduct, securing new protections for students and faculty accused of misconduct.The new rules modify Title IX, a 1972 law prohibiting “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance,” narrowing the definition of sexual harassment and requiring schools to challenge evidence and cross-examine students via a live hearing, among other things detailed in the more than 2,000-page rule. The new regulations, which take effect in August, will only find schools in violation of Title IX if they are determined to be “deliberately indifferent” to accusations of sexual assault that occurred in their programs and activities. "Too many students have lost access to their education because their school inadequately responded when a student filed a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault," DeVos said in a statemnet. "This new regulation requires schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process. We can and must continue to fight sexual misconduct in our nation's schools, and this rule makes certain that fight continues."President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves. Here's why Biden's Super Bowl prediction: 'Loves' Bengals' quarterback, but Rams 'hard to beat' GOP Senate candidate to run 'Let's go Brandon' ad during Super Bowl MORE issued a statement describing the new regulations as “even-handed justice” with “a transparent grievance process that treats the accused as innocent until proven guilty.”“With today’s action and every action to come, the Trump administration will fight for America’s students,” Trump said in a statement. DeVos and the Trump administration have been critical of Title IX, which they have said unjustly puts matters of sexual assault and harassment in the hands of education officials. Republicans were critical of the Obama administration’s use of Title IX, which they argue lacked public input. “This final rule respects and supports victims and preserves due process rights for both the victim and the accused,” Sen.
