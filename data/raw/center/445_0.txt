IOWA CITY, Iowa—Former Vice President      Joe Biden        said he would testify in President Trump’s impeachment trial if subpoenaed by Senate Republicans, reversing course after earlier saying he would refuse but reiterating his view that participating wouldn’t shed light on the charges.During an appearance before the Des Moines Register’s editorial board on Friday, the 2020 Democratic presidential contender said he wouldn’t comply with a subpoena for his testimony because it would allow the president to divert attention from the actions that led to impeachment. But on Saturday, Mr. Biden said he would “honor whatever the Congress in fact legitimately asked me to do,” adding that he didn’t expect the Senate to seek his testimony. During an event in Fairfield, Iowa, Saturday night, Mr. Biden was even more direct, telling an audience he would “obey any subpoena that was sent to me.”              Campaign 2020                Mr. Biden’s reversal followed a series of tweets he posted Saturday morning, saying that he had “always complied with a lawful order” and “cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests” during his long career in the Senate and as vice president. But he added that he wouldn’t “pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial,” arguing that the impeachment process “is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.”               The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.     Questions over whether Mr. Biden might be willing to appear before the upcoming Senate impeachment trial—a hypothetical that might not come to fruition—trailed the candidate as he campaigned in Iowa ahead of the state’s opening presidential caucuses on Feb. 3.     After Mr. Biden suggested he wouldn’t comply with a subpoena, one of his leading Democratic rivals,         Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren,    said he should appear before Congress if he receives a legitimate request.     “He has said he always follows lawfully issued orders, and if there is a lawfully issued order for a subpoena, then he should follow it,” Ms. Warren told reporters in Iowa.     Senate Republicans, who hold a majority, are considering rules for the trial involving two articles of impeachment passed by the House earlier this month related to Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, who is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.     During the impeachment hearings, House Republicans attacked Mr. Biden’s son,         Hunter Biden,    for allegedly seeking to profit from his father’s role as vice president by serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings. Mr. Trump’s request of Ukraine’s leader to announce investigations into the Bidens’ work in the country, as his administration concurrently delayed military aid and Ukraine sought a coveted White House visit, sparked the inquiry that led to the impeachment vote.     Both Bidens have said there is no evidence that they committed any wrongdoing, and Mr. Biden’s campaign has pointed to the testimony of a veteran U.S. diplomat who said during the impeachment hearings that there was no truth to Mr. Trump’s theory that the former vice president acted to protect his son’s interests.     Senate Democrats have said they want to hear during the trial from four witnesses whose testimony the White House blocked during the House investigation. The administration’s efforts to block such subpoenas led to one of the two articles of impeachment, for obstruction. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he doesn’t want witnesses to testify—a potential conflict with the president, who has suggested on Twitter that the Bidens should be forced to appear before the Senate.     In an interview on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday,         Rep. Joe Kennedy    (D., Mass.) supported Mr. Biden’s statement “that he would abide by any lawful order that comes his way.”     “That’s probably the right thing to do,” said Mr. Kennedy, who has endorsed Ms. Warren for president. He added, however, that there are no credible allegations that the vice president has done anything wrong, or that he would be a relevant witness to the charges against the president.     “This is again more smoke and mirrors from Republicans in the House and Senate that are trying to obfuscate and hide around and misdirect the attention of the American public off of the actions of the president of the United States who clearly abused his power,” he said.     The issue could be moot for Mr. Biden. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, and 51 votes would likely be needed to summon witnesses and set rules. That means if a handful of Republican senators side with Democrats on witness requests, GOP lawmakers wouldn’t be able to call any witnesses that Mr. Trump may demand.     Congress remains at an impasse over the next steps of the impeachment process. Since the House vote, Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        has declined to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate until she knows what the rules will be for Mr. Trump’s trial, which Democrats have said should be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.     —Kate Davidson contributed to this article.
