                 | April 16, 2021 06:11 AM                Eight people were shot and killed at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, before the gunman took his own life, according to police.      Officers were first called after reports of gunfire at the facility near Indianapolis International Airport after 11 p.m., police spokeswoman Genae Cook said early Friday morning.             The perpetrator was identified as 19-year-old Brandon Hole of Indiana, according to the Associated Press, which cited two law enforcement officials.       The suspect allegedly arrived at the parking lot and began shooting people with a rifle, went inside the building, and shot himself before he could be confronted by officers, said Craig McCartt, deputy chief of criminal investigations for the city, during a press conference.       The incident was "very short" and "probably only lasted one to two minutes," McCartt said in a prior interview.       “Our officers went toward danger as they typically do, and when they arrived on the scene, they found something that really no one should see," Chief Randal Taylor told reporters.       There were at least five more people, including one person with critical injuries. Four of the wounded individuals were hit by gunfire, while one suffered a different ailment.       The area where the incident occurred is near two other counties, so tracking the total number of wounded might be difficult initially, Cook said.       She urged those at the scene to contact detectives, saying it was too early to speculate on motive and if the shooter was an employee at the facility.      “Indianapolis is a resilient community," Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said. "Last night was a devastating blow, and its impact will be felt by our community for days and weeks to come. But in times of despair, I know that our residents will rally together and help one another make it through.”       Hogsett expressed his support for gun control measures prior to completion of the investigation, which has seen assistance from the FBI.       “Last week, I signed on to a letter from over 150 mayors from around the country asking for the United States Senate to consider legislation that would expand background checks to be required when firearms are transferred between private citizens, and close the Charleston Loophole, which allows federally licensed firearms dealers to transfer guns to customers before an adequate background check is completed," he said.      He continued: “I think that the community needs to engage in serious conversations and not just our community, but I think conversations need to be held around our country. Those conversations should be driven by the extraordinary proliferation of guns and cycles of violence."       President Joe Biden is set to be briefed on the violent spree.       “The president will be briefed this morning on the shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis," an official in Biden's orbit told CNN. "The White House chief of staff has been in touch with the mayor of Indianapolis and the homeland security adviser is in touch with law enforcement officials."      CHICAGO OFFICIALS RELEASE VIDEO SHOWING MOMENT OFFICER FATALLY SHOOTS TEENAGER      A witness was working inside the building when he heard gunshots, he told WTHR-TV.      “I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing, and he starts yelling stuff that I could not understand,” Levi Miller said. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.”      Ashlee Floyd's father has worked at the facility for two decades, she told the Indianapolis Star, adding that he usually calls his wife around 11:25 p.m., but he didn’t call Thursday.      “I don’t know if he’s OK. I don’t know if he’s injured. I don’t know if he’s gone. I’m just scared right now,” she said.      In other recent mass shootings, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses across the Atlanta area, and 10 were killed at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.      “I am heartbroken by the mass shooting at the FedEx facility here in Indianapolis and praying for all affected by this tragedy,” said Rep. Andre Carson, a Democrat whose district includes much of the city.
