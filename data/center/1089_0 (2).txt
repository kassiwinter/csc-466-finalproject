President         Barack Obama    vowed Wednesday to focus his final three years in office on income inequality in the U.S., calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage and defending the government's role in boosting economic mobility."I take this personally,"         Mr. Obama    said at a speech hosted by a think tank closely aligned to the White House, noting that members of his family have benefited from government programs. It is "what drives me as a grandson, a son, a father—as an American." He said that rising income inequality and decreased economic mobility "pose a fundamental threat" to American prosperity.      The economic agenda he detailed pushes a number of liberal priorities popular with the Democratic base.                Mr. Obama called for eased rules for union organizers, passage of a budget that combines stimulus spending with long-term deficit reduction measures, expanded government programs for children and new antidiscrimination laws.           More           Republicans said the president was trying to distract attention from the problems of the health law and criticized many of the policy elements in Mr. Obama's speech.      "They promote government reliance rather than economic mobility," said         Brendan Buck,    spokesman for House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio).      "Rather than tackling income inequality by lifting people up, he's been fixated on taxing some down," added Mr. Buck in a blog post.      Republicans said a better course would be to promote school choice, approve stalled natural-resource projects and adopt other programs typically favored by the GOP.                                          President Barack Obama said that growing income inequality is harming the U.S. economy and called on Congress to increase the minimum wage.

"Instead of addressing people's frustrations he's trying to change the subject," said Rep.         Kevin McCarthy    (R., Calif.), the House GOP whip, referring to the troubled rollout of the federal health-care overhaul.     Business groups said a higher federal minimum wage wouldn't accomplish Mr. Obama's goals. "Arbitrarily raising the cost of labor would increase, not reduce, the unemployment rate among young, less-skilled workers,"         Bruce Josten    of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.              Boeing Co.    CEO         W. James McNerney Jr.    , chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of large companies, also saw a cost to raising the minimum wage.      "In many cases, if the workers are not productive commensurate with the increased labor costs, then we'd move to places where the cost is commensurate," said Mr. McNerney, who also is chairman of Mr. Obama's Export Council, which advises on trade issues.     Democrats in Congress are planning to press for action on the president's agenda ahead of the 2014 elections, believing the topics he raised in his speech resonate with voters. But there is little chance that they can pass legislation through a divided Congress.                                                 President Obama presented new details of his economic agenda in a speech Wednesday in Washington.          Associated Press                                                                                                             The issue first on the calendar is the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits before the end of the year. Mr. Obama called for renewing the expanded benefits, while many Republicans oppose the idea, saying the program was meant as a temporary response to the recession.      House Democrats will call attention to the program on Thursday, when the party has invited unemployed workers to testify at an ad hoc hearing.      The president's call for an increase in the federal minimum wage also sets him on a collision course with congressional Republicans, who often argue that the change would prompt businesses to cut low-wage jobs.      Senate Democrats are readying a push either this month or next to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 in steps over several years.      The federal minimum wage for most workers is currently $7.25 per hour; 10 states and the District of Columbia have higher minimums, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.      Liberals welcomed Mr. Obama's speech.      Sen.         Tom Harkin    (D., Iowa) said the president had issued "a powerful message: low-wage jobs and income inequality are only increasing.''      Mr. Harkin, the Senate sponsor of a minimum-wage bill, also noted that "today's minimum wage has one-third less buying power than it did at its peak in 1968."     Democratic leaders generally see a minimum-wage increase as necessary and a strong political play, though there are concerns within the caucus about the legislation.      Some Democratic Senate aides, however, said a push to increase the minimum wage could pose a risk for some vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2014.              Mary Landrieu    of Louisiana,         Kay Hagan    of North Carolina and         Mark Pryor    of Arkansas are among Senate Democrats expected to face tough re-election battles this year.      None of the offices immediately responded to questions about their support for raising the minimum wage.     Mr. Obama's 45-minute speech was hosted by the Center for American Progress. The White House billed it as a preview of his coming State of the Union address and a follow to his 2011 speech in Osawatomie, Kan., which set the tone for his re-election campaign.     In addition to pushing Congress to act on his priorities, the White House is expected this month to release executive orders on economic initiatives.      Mr. Obama said he and first lady Michelle Obama will hold an event next week with college presidents and nonprofits to discuss ways to provide college educations to low-income students.     He said he plans to push for programs for workers to learn new skills and for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which supporters say would help prevent pay discrimination against women.      Mr. Obama also called for passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which aims to prevent employment discrimination against gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual workers.     The overarching theme of his speech, however, was that the government has a role to play, through these initiatives, in economic concerns.     "These programs are not typically hammocks for people to just lie back and relax," Mr. Obama said. "These programs of social insurance benefit all of us, because we don't know when we might have a run of bad luck."     Write to         Carol E. Lee at carol.lee@wsj.com and Michael R.
