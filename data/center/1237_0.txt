The U.S. surpassed six million confirmed coronavirus cases as August came to a close, capping a month during which the spread of the virus slowed in some hot spots but deaths across the country climbed.The six million mark came roughly three weeks after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases reached five million. That reflects a slowdown in the number of new daily reported cases—the rise from four million to five million cases happened over a period of about 2½ weeks.           However, the number of daily confirmed infections remains elevated compared with the earliest days of summer. The U.S. reported more than 35,000 new cases for Sunday, the smallest daily increase since Aug. 23, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Three months ago, on May 30, there were 24,450 cases reported.      All told, the U.S. added about 1.38 million cases in August through Monday, according to Johns Hopkins, compared with the 1.87 million it added for all of July.               Arthur Reingold, head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was “highly plausible” that cases would increase in coming months compared with August as schools reopen and people tire of precautionary measures such as social distancing.     Several U.S. hot spots did appear to get a respite in August after a surge of new cases swept throughout the south and west in July. Four states—Arizona, California, Florida and Texas—accounted for nearly half of all new coronavirus cases reported in July.

Last updated        Source: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering         For the month through Aug. 30, all four states saw a drop in the number of reported cases compared with a month earlier, though they still accounted for roughly 40% of total new monthly cases in the U.S. The drop was most pronounced in Arizona, where the number of new cases reported through Sunday fell more than 70% compared with July’s total. Cases fell by more than 50% in Florida.      However, some states in the Midwest are starting to see daily case counts tick up. On Thursday, Iowa reported 2,681 new cases, a record for the state. Minnesota and Kansas last week each reported more than 1,000 new cases in a day for the first time since the pandemic started. Rural parts of Illinois and Ohio have also started to see increases.     “We’ve had really very different situations in different parts of the country,” Dr. Reingold said, adding later that he would be surprised if more than 5% or 10% of people have been infected so far in most parts of the U.S.     Now several newly reopened colleges and universities are struggling to contain outbreaks.      The State University of New York in Oneonta on Sunday became one of the latest to move to remote learning after the school, which has roughly 6,000 undergraduates, found more than 100 cases.      Getting a clear picture of the virus in August remained a challenge as testing was beset by delays and, at times, derailed in some parts of the country by natural disasters including wildfires and Hurricanes Isaias and Laura.         Understanding the Coronavirus        The U.S. conducted 20.8 million tests in August, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project through Aug. 30, compared with 22.4 million for July.      Nationally, the percentage of tests that came back positive, known as the positivity rate, dipped to 5.35% on Aug. 30, down from 8.6% a month earlier. The World Health Organization has said a positivity rate of 5% or lower for at least two weeks is a key threshold for economies to safely reopen. Twenty-seven states and Puerto Rico had a positivity rate that was more than 5%, according to Johns Hopkins.      The number of people in hospitals also fell over the course of most of August. A total of 36,470 people were hospitalized Aug. 29, down from 57,339 a month earlier, the Covid Tracking Project showed, though hospitalization data vary from state to state.

Last updated    Sources: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering; the Lancet; Associated Press; U.S. Census           While the number of newly reported cases and coronavirus hospitalizations drifted down throughout August, the number of deaths went up. More than 28,000 Americans died from the virus in August as of Monday, surpassing the more than 25,600 deaths recorded in July and pushing the death toll past 183,000. Deaths often lag new infections, as the virus progresses over the course of several weeks.     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Aug. 27 estimated deaths could reach between 196,000 and 207,000 during the week of Sept. 19, based on data from 37 modeling groups.      Asked about the president’s retweet over the weekend of a report falsely claiming only 9,000 people had “actually” died from coronavirus, White House press secretary         Kayleigh McEnany    said the president was referring to a CDC report that said 94% of people who died from Covid-19 had underlying conditions.      During their respective national conventions, Democrats and Republicans presented vastly different views on the continuing severity of the outbreak and the efficacy of the Trump administration’s response.

House Democrats on Monday released eight reports issued by the White House coronavirus task force between June 23 and Aug. 9 that showed the group was aware of increasing cases of Covid-19 in five states even as Mr. Trump and other federal health officials made public comments minimizing the pandemic.     The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis obtained the reports under a July request to Vice President Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, who is on the task force. In an example cited by the subcommittee, the June 23 report showed that for the week ended June 20, new cases increased 70% from the prior week in Arizona, 72% in Texas, 87% in Florida, 93% in Oklahoma, and 134% in Idaho. The report pointed to an opinion essay Mr. Pence wrote about the pandemic that was published in The Wall Street Journal that same month that said, “We are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.”     A senior White House adviser said Monday that Mr. Pence’s opinion piece was focused on recognizing the sacrifice of front-line workers and all Americans, and to focus on flattening the curve. It was also published at a time when most counties didn’t have significant outbreaks, the adviser said.        
A closer look at the Pandemic        States that suffered heavy losses early in the pandemic continued to take tentative steps toward normalcy.         New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy    announced the return of indoor dining, and said indoor performance venues and movie theaters could reopen, all with capacity restrictions.     New York City, while still holding off on indoor dining, marched steadily toward its Sept. 10 reopening date for the nation’s largest public school district, despite concerns flagged by the teachers union.     In Miami, the start of the new school year hit a snag Monday when the school district’s data center encountered internet connectivity problems, according to the district. The Miami-Dade County school system, which has about 350,000 students, said the problem had been identified and the district was working to resolve it.      School districts across Florida have been reopening in the past few weeks with a mix of in-person and remote learning. The state teachers union has filed a lawsuit, which is moving through the courts, challenging a state order requiring all districts except those in South Florida to offer students the option of in-person instruction.                                         Public health organizations tracking the spread of coronavirus use graphs and charts to visualize the data.
