WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives passed a bill that would usher in the most far-reaching overhaul of the U.S. tax system in 31 years, a plan that would reduce the corporate tax rate to its lowest point since 1939 and cut individual taxes for most households in 2018.The bill would repeal the alternative minimum tax, increase the child tax credit, abolish the estate tax by 2025 and transform the U.S. system for taxing multinational corporations. The plan also would raise taxes on some people by removing personal exemptions and deductions for state and local income taxes, medical expenses and student loan interest. On the whole, the bill would reduce federal taxes by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. The 227-205 House vote was a victory for Speaker         Paul Ryan    (R., Wis.) and President      Donald Trump,        who rallied Republicans in the Capitol before the vote. Republicans want to finish the new tax law before the year ends. They are banking on it to spur faster economic growth and see it as essential to retaining control of both chambers of Congress in next year’s elections.     Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill; no Democrats voted for it.                “We are in a generational defining moment for our country,” Mr. Ryan said on the House floor before the vote. “It is finally time that we get the general interest of this country to prevail over the special interests in Washington.”        
Related        The political imperative for the GOP, along with support from business groups and conservatives, spurred Republicans to move quickly. Thursday’s vote came exactly two weeks after they revealed the first version of the bill. Their chances of finishing major structural changes to the tax code now appear greater than at any point since Republicans took control of the House in 2010.     But there are warning signs as the focus in Washington turns to the Senate’s companion bill. All but one of the House Republicans who voted no on Thursday was from New York, New Jersey and California, all high-tax states. They opposed new limits in the bill on state and local tax deductions. The Senate’s changes to this deduction are even more severe than the House’s, denying a $10,000 property-tax deduction that the House bill includes. That means Thursday’s margin may get even tighter if and when a final bill emerges and goes back to the House for another vote.     The Senate’s passage of its own bill is no certainty either.                                         The House of Representatives passed a big multi-year tax cut and tax reform bill on Thursday. It's been more than thirty years since there was a really broad tax reform measure that was passed by Congress. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains problems the bill may face in the coming weeks ahead.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) already declared his opposition because of the treatment of partnerships, S corporations and other so-called pass-through businesses in the Senate version of the bill.     Senate Republicans, rattled by Sen. Johnson’s statement a day earlier, were working Thursday to address his points. Underscoring the concern, Mr. Trump called Mr. Johnson Wednesday night and asked the senator to deliver his own analysis about his problems with the tax plan. Mr. Johnson was also scheduled to meet with Treasury staffers Thursday to get their views, especially on the cost of lowering the pass-through rate to 25%.              Sen. Susan Collins    (R., Maine) has expressed concerns about the Senate GOP’s decision to pair the tax bill with a repeal of the mandate for individuals to have health insurance. And Sens.         Jeff Flake    (R., Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) say they are worried about budget deficits.                                         Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said he opposes the current tax bill, marking a setback to GOP efforts to quickly pass a bill. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains where things now stand on the tax overhaul effort.

Lisa Murkowski    (R., Alaska) and         John McCain    (R., Ariz.), who voted against a GOP health plan this year, are possible swing votes, too.     For the moment, though, House Republicans were exuberant. Mr. Ryan hugged Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), who is responsible for rounding up votes, right after the totals were announced. If the Senate passes a bill, lawmakers would either try to hash out a compromise or get the House to accept the Senate version.     “Both bills are really good,” Mr. Scalise said. “Our bill is really good. The Senate’s bill is really good. They’re just a little different, and not a lot different, which is important.”     Democrats called the House tax plan a giveaway to wealthy business owners and warned that it would drive the country deeper into debt and serve as a prelude to future cuts in Social Security and Medicare. They questioned whether the corporate tax cuts would really spur broadly shared economic gains and highlighted what they called budget gimmicks in the bill. That includes the expiration of a family credit in 2023, meaning higher taxes in the future.        
More        “They’re trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class,” said         Rep. Nancy Pelosi    (D., Calif.), the House Democratic leader. “It preys on the middle class and those who aspire to it. It pillages and loots the middle class.”     The GOP tax overhaul effort has been years in the making and has never advanced this far. Mr. Ryan and         Rep. Kevin Brady    (R., Texas), the House bill’s chief author, jettisoned several of their own priorities to get consensus within the party, meet Mr. Trump’s aims and squeeze the plan inside its $1.5 trillion budget target.     After heavy lobbying from retailers, they abandoned a plan to tax imports and exempt exports. They offered the property tax deduction to sway lawmakers from New York, Illinois and California, and that worked for some, especially for members from rural or low-income parts of those states. Messrs. Ryan and Brady pushed estate tax repeal off into the future. They kept the top individual tax rate at 39.6% and didn’t touch tax rates on capital gains and dividends. House Republicans accepted all of those changes.     The House plan would provide, on average, tax cuts for every income group in 2019, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which analyzes tax policy for Congress. But that is just on average and across income groups not everyone would gain. About 8% of households would pay more in 2019 and that proportion would rise to 20% over time, according to a JCT analysis of an earlier version of the bill.     For middle-income households, earning between $75,000 and $100,000, 84% would get a tax cut in 2019 and 66% would see a tax cut by 2027, while 11% would see a tax increase in year one and 26% would see a tax increase in 2027.     The House vote leaves Republicans exactly where they were on health policy earlier this year, with a bill passed by one chamber that won’t be accepted as written by the other.     “It was seven years in the making so obviously to see that work come to a successful conclusion today is a great feeling,” said         Rep. Tom Reed    (R., N.Y.) “But it’s a feeling that’s short-lasting because we’ve got to get to the finish line.”     There are some important differences between the House bill and its Senate counterpart, which is headed for a floor vote after Thanksgiving. The Senate version features completely different rules on how the U.S. taxes multinational corporations and pass-through businesses.     On a 14-12 party-line vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved its version of the bill Thursday night, after adopting a late amendment. The changes included a minor alteration in the tax treatment of carried interest, which would require investment managers to hold assets for at least three years to get lower long-term capital gains rates. That’s unlikely to affect most hedge funds, venture capitalists and private equity managers.     The Senate proposal includes other provisions that aren’t in the House bill at all, including temporary changes to alcohol taxation and a new tax credit for employers who provide family leave.     Moreover, the Senate plan sets all of its individual tax cuts to expire after 2025. The expiration helps the Republican plan comply with Senate rules that restrict tax and spending bills from adding to deficits beyond 10 years unless they can win 60 votes or more. The corporate tax changes would be permanent.     Another complication in the Senate: A decision by party leaders to include in the tax bill a repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that Americans own health insurance. Senators sparred on Thursday over new analyses about the impact of the repeal.     The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that households earning between $10,000 and $30,000 would see a tax increase under the bill because repeal of the mandate meant lower-income households wouldn’t be get subsidies in the form of tax credits that come with purchasing health coverage. Republicans disputed the analysis, saying it would be the choice of these households to forgo such coverage and the subsidies that come with it.     “This is absolutely not a tax increase and you guys know that,”         Sen. Pat Toomey    (R., Pa.) said to Democrats at a Finance Committee meeting.      The analysis also found that by 2027, after the individual tax cuts expire, households earning under $75,000 would have tax increases on average under the Senate plan, compared with current law.     “I don’t know how anybody can go home now to the folks they represent and explain why it’s a good idea to hike taxes on parents who barely stay afloat to pay for a massive corporate handout,” said         Sen. Ron Wyden    (D., Ore.). “What is happening now is just shameful.”      Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
