                                                                                                                                         Two White House guard dogs injured while stopping an intruder from reaching the front door of the presidential office were checked by a veterinarian and given the green light Thursday to return to duty.                                                                                                                                                      The Secret Service K-9s, Hurricane and Jordan, were treated for minor bruises after successfully fending off Dominic Adesanya, who jumped the fence and rushed the building, authorities said.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Adesanya, 23, fought the dogs, kicking one and throwing and punching the other on the ground. But the Secret Service said both were cleared for duty by the veterinarian, the New York Times reported.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Adesanya is in the custody of the Marshals Service, facing two counts of assaulting the police dogs, the Times reported. He also reportedly faces four counts of resisting and unlawful entry and one count of making threats.                                                                                                                              Law enforcement officials said he had outstanding warrants.                                                                                                                                                       Hurricane and Jordan are part of the Secret Serviceâ€™s attempt to bolster security at the White House amid recent intrusions onto the property.
