The House on Tuesday approved a bill to extend the federal government's borrowing authority with no strings attached, after Republican leaders dropped all policy demands to avoid a market-rattling confrontation in an election year.The measure, which would suspend the debt limit and allow the government to borrow until March 16, 2015, marked a retreat from efforts by House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) to require any debt-ceiling increase to be paired with spending cuts of equal size or with other conservative policy demands—many of which were pushed by the tea party.           Related           The vote was 221 to 201, with 199 Republicans breaking with Mr. Boehner to oppose the debt-ceiling increase. Only two Democrats voted against the bill. The Senate is expected to pass the measure, but the timing is unclear.     President         Barack Obama    and Democrats in Congress have long demanded the "clean" debt-ceiling increase, stripped of policy attachments, and Mr. Boehner concluded that the only way to move an increase through the House was to accede.               "It's a disappointing moment," Mr. Boehner said before the vote, attacking Democrats for refusing to pair spending cuts with the debt-limit increase. "This is a lost opportunity," he said.     But by avoiding a cliff-hanging debt fight, Mr. Boehner's strategy may advance a central Republican political goal ahead of the midterm elections: to keep the public focused on the problems of the 2010 health-care law, which Republican candidates across the country are trying to pin on Democrats.

"When this is over, we will focus on our agenda and—if we win six seats in the Senate—what we will do different if we control all of Congress," said Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio).          Congress has been aiming to pass a debt-limit increase before Feb. 27, the date the Treasury says it will run out of tools to continue paying the government's bills. Congress is in recess next week, pressuring lawmakers to act quickly to avoid the need for 11th-hour action at the end of the month. The Treasury on Tuesday said the federal government holds $17.212 trillion in public debt.     Accusing Mr. Obama of running up the debt, Mr. Boehner put the burden on Democrats to deliver most of the votes needed to pass the bill. With only 200 Democrats in the House, at least 18 of the chamber's 232 Republicans had to back the legislation in order to reach the 218 votes needed for passage. In the end, 28 Republicans backed the debt-limit legislation.     House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) argued during floor debate on the bill that both parties were responsible for the federal debt, which has mounted under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and that lifting the debt ceiling was a matter of paying bills that Congress has already incurred.     "There is no responsible alternative but to pay our bills,'' Mr. Hoyer said. "We were all responsible for the debt."                                                                                                                                                     Senate leaders said they were optimistic that the debt-limit increase would pass the Senate, but it remained unclear whether any Republicans would use the chamber's procedural tools to slow action. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said Tuesday that he hoped the Senate would consider the bill on Wednesday.     If no one objected to quick action, the Senate could then vote on the bill.     The White House welcomed Mr. Boehner's decision to move a bill stripped of policy demands.     "Our hope would be that…the tactic of threatening default, or threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for budget debates, is over, off the table," said White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, speaking at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.     The House bill would mark the first unencumbered debt-limit increase since 2009. It was the latest and most vivid evidence of how the GOP has been moving away from the confrontational legislative strategy aimed at securing spending cuts that was its hallmark after it took control of the House in the 2010 election with strong support from tea-party activists.     Republicans have used showdowns over must-pass fiscal bills to secure big cuts in government spending, including in a 2011 budget deal that locked in more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. But the brinkmanship failed last fall, when an unsuccessful conservative drive to cut off funds for the health-care law produced a 16-day government shutdown that most Republicans believed damaged their party.     In the wake of the shutdown, Mr. Boehner has allowed passage of three major pieces of legislation with bipartisan majorities—a two-year budget deal, a governmentwide spending bill and an extension of federal farm programs.      Drawing lessons from the shutdown, most in the party concluded that they shouldn't risk a default by extending the debt-limit debate.     "The government shutdown was a watershed moment," said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster. The speaker's decision to allow a debt-limit increase reflects "the recognition we need to find other strategies and better tactics for advancing a conservative fiscal agenda."                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Boehner had a particularly hard time managing the debt-limit issue, because many Republicans had campaigned on pledges never to vote to increase the borrowing cap.      That meant he couldn't assemble 218 votes to pass a debt-limit bill with Republican votes alone. To lure Democratic votes, he floated a plan to link the debt-ceiling increase with a measure repealing a planned cut in military-pension cost-of-living increases.     But he ran into continued Democratic insistence on keeping the debt bill free of any policy riders, including measures that Democrats support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) reiterated that position when she spoke to Mr. Boehner on Monday.     Mr. Boehner said he responded that if he retreated from the pension proposal and allowed a clean debt limit to advance, he expected every Democrat in the House to vote for it.     The two Democrats who ended up voting against the bill—Reps. John Barrow of Georgia and Jim Matheson of Utah—both represent conservative-leaning districts. Mr. Matheson said in December that he plans to retire from Congress at the end of the year.     The cadre of 28 Republicans who voted for the bill included mostly senior members of the GOP leadership such as Mr. Boehner; lawmakers who are retiring such as Rep. Frank Wolf (R., Va.); and committee chairmen such as Darrell Issa (R., Calif.).      However, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) voted against the bill.      House GOP leaders' decision to bring a stripped-down debt-limit bill to the floor incensed outside conservative groups, which immediately called for wiping out the ranks of top House Republicans.     "Leadership needs to go—they need to be completely changed," said Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, who added that her group would focus on making sure GOP leaders are defeated in the 2014 elections.      "They have no spine to fight for anything," she said.     But even some of the conservatives who opposed the debt increase said they understood how Republicans' internal divisions limited Mr. Boehner's options.     "I do understand—if we don't have the votes, and the Republican leadership in the House does have a responsibility to govern—the pressure that they're under," said Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas). "Before we do away with the GOP leadership in the House, let's change the Democratic leadership in the Senate to GOP and get us a new president."
