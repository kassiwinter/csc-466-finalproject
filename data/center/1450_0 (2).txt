Tony Clement (@TonyclementCPC) October 22, 2014      The incident comes after the country raised its terror threat level from low to medium and two days after two Canadian soldiers were run down — one of them killed — in Quebec by a man who reportedly had jihadist sympathies.  In a televised address to his country, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said over the next few days "we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had."        Citizens are advised to stay off rooftops and away from windows in the downtown core. Avoid downtown core.— National Division RCMP (@Nat_Div_RCMP) October 22, 2014      But this attack, as well as the one earlier this week, shows that "Canada is not immune to the type of terrorist attacks we see elsewhere."  Harper, however, said that this will not intimidate his country. Instead, Canada will redouble its efforts against terrorism, he said, and make sure terrorists find "no safe haven."      During a press conference, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said this is still an "ongoing investigation" and asked "people to stay away from [Ottawa's] downtown core."   Bordeleau was asked if police were still looking for other suspects, but he would only say that authorities are sweeping Parliament Hill to make sure it is safe.  Bordeleau and an official for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is in charge of investigating what happened on Parliament Hill, said it was too early to assign a motive to the shooting incident.  Even after the sun set, Parliament remained locked down.  This is a breaking news story. We'll update once we know more.

Harper said that over the coming days the country will learn more "about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had."

Suspected Shooter:  Citing Canadian and American sources, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News and the CBC say the suspected gunman is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who was born in Canada in 1982.

NBC News reports that Zehaf-Bibeau changed his name and he used be called Michael Joseph Hall.
