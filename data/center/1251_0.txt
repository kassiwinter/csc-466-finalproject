The number of people seeking and receiving state unemployment benefits fell at the end of August, signs of a slow improvement in a U.S. labor market still deeply damaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 in the week ended Aug. 29, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits through regular state programs, which cover most workers, decreased by 1.24 million to about 13.3 million for the week ended Aug. 22. The latest figures on jobless benefits are part of a mixed picture about the labor market, which remains in a deep hole because of economic disruptions from the pandemic. About 29 million people were receiving assistance from state and federal programs as of mid-August, Labor Department data showed. The number of people seeking assistance through some pandemic-related programs also has increased in recent weeks.      Moreover, the Labor Department changed how it calculates seasonal adjustments for regular state claims starting with Thursday’s release, a move meant to better align the adjusted figures with raw numbers because of coronavirus-related distortions.               The bulk of last week’s decline in new applications for state benefits reflects the methodology change, said         Aneta Markowska,    chief economist at Jefferies LLC.      “Last week’s decrease is a catch up to the improvement that has been happening,” she said. “The labor market is healing, but the rate improvement is slowing and will continue to slow.”                                         The U.S. unemployment rate shot up faster than in any other developed country during the pandemic.

Figures on pandemic programs can be volatile because they rely on reporting from states about new programs put in place since the pandemic started.      The pandemic assistance covers gig workers, the self employed and those with special circumstances, such as being unable to report to work due to lack of child care. That program, which is less generous than regular state programs, paid benefits to 13.6 million recipients during the week of Aug. 15, the latest available data. The figure also nearly matched those paid by state programs.          “This is seriously worrying evidence that contractors, entrepreneurs and self-employed workers are losing their income, and in some cases closing up shop for good,” said         Patrick Anderson,    chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group consulting firm.      Weekly applications to state programs, data with a half-century record, are down from a peak of more than six million in late March, but the recent level remains well above the roughly 200,000 claims filed weekly in February. Before this year, the most claims filed in a single week was 695,000 in 1982.        
More        Seasonal adjustments are meant to account for regular swings in layoffs that occur during certain times of the year, such as around holidays. The coronavirus, however, didn’t align with historical patterns and likely led seasonal adjustments to overstate the actual number of weekly unemployment claims, economists say.     The Labor Department didn’t revise previously published data Thursday. Forecasting firm         IHS Markit    estimates that if the Labor Department had changed its data methodology at the beginning of the pandemic, the cumulative number of seasonally adjusted jobless claims could be about four million lower since mid-March.     While that would be a significant revision, it doesn’t change the overall narrative: The pandemic and related shutdowns caused layoffs to soar to levels not previously recorded in data back to the 1960s, and the amount is still likely to remain near levels associated with recessions in the near term.          Ms. Markowska expects job growth to ease this fall as most workers who were temporarily laid off are recalled and business closures and downsizing result in about seven million permanent job losses.      U.S. employers shed 22 million jobs in March and April and replaced 9 million of those the following three months. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the August jobs report, to be released Friday, will show employers added 1.3 million jobs, reflecting still strong but easing job growth.     Construction and manufacturing, buoyed by a hot housing market, should add jobs at a strong rate, Ms. Markowska said, while service-sector gains should come at a slower pace, and government jobs, including at public schools, could decline in August.          Private-sector measures show the number of open jobs has plateaued and the growth in worker shifts has slowed from the spring. And several large employers have warned of job cuts.         United Airlines Holdings Inc.    said Wednesday it planned to cut 16,370 staff amid a pandemic-driven slump in passenger demand,         Ford Motor Co.    is offering buyouts to salaried employees with the aim of cutting 1,400 workers, and cities have said they are contemplating staff cuts.     Kimberly Blevins, 37 years old, of Wilmington, Del., said she was laid off from her housekeeping job at a         Holiday Inn    in March, and hasn’t been able to find a job to support herself and her 3-year-old son.     “It’s flipped our world upside down,” she said. “I’ve put in applications left and right, but most companies haven’t even hired back all their old people yet.”     Ms. Blevins is receiving unemployment benefits, but after the $600 federal enhancement to benefits expired at the end of July, her weekly payment fell to $69, she said. She broke her apartment lease and moved in with her mother.     “I’m hurting my mom financially,” Ms. Blevins said. “She can’t afford to take care of us on her Social Security.”     President Trump signed an executive action last month allowing states to tap disaster-relief funds to pay for a $300 a week in enhanced aid on top of state benefits. More than 40 states have received federal approval to distribute the extra payments, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Some states, including Arizona and Louisiana, have already started delivering the money to individuals.     The Labor Department estimates it could take an average of three weeks for states to disburse the supplemental assistance. The money to fund the extra payments is limited, and could be exhausted in five or six weeks, depending on the number who qualify for such funds.          There are jobs available for unemployed workers in fields such as manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, said Deb Thorpe, president of Troy, Mich., staffing firm Kelly Professional & Industrial.     But it is hard for firms to fill such jobs, which range in pay from $13 to $17 an hour, despite a historically high unemployment rate, she said. Workers remain concerned about safety and school closures mean many don’t have child care. Until recently, enhanced benefits meant many workers received more from benefits than they would receive in work pay. Ms. Thorpe said the no-show rate for new hires fell to about 20% after the enhanced benefits expired, from 40%, but the rate remains more than double a year ago.     “We are seeing moderate demand for workers,” she said. “And more people are coming back to work because they want financial stability—they have bills to pay.”     —Sarah Chaney contributed to this article.
