 The sudden move by Mr. Trump on Tuesday galvanized Democrats, who said         James Comey’s    dismissal would sap ongoing federal investigations of any credibility and underscored the need for an independent person to oversee the probe and any subsequent prosecution. Many compared the firing to         Richard Nixon’s    Justice Department dismissals during the Watergate scandal.     “This is Nixonian,” Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) said in a statement, in which he called for an independent investigation into possible Trump-Russia ties.

Republicans, meanwhile, acknowledged the timing and circumstances of Mr. Comey’s firing looked bad, though many stopped short of calling for a special counsel.          Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman         Richard Burr,    the North Carolina Republican leading the Senate investigation, said the FBI director’s dismissal “further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee.”     Without a special counsel, a new FBI director appointed by Mr. Trump would oversee the probe, and Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein,    appointed by Mr. Trump earlier this year, would decide whether to move forward with any charges or prosecution.

Both Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein were involved in making the recommendation to the White House that Mr. Comey be fired, according to statements and letters the White House released Tuesday.     The cloud over the Russia probe is likely to challenge Mr. Trump when he seeks Senate confirmation for his choice to replace Mr. Comey. Democrats are all but certain to oppose his nominee without the appointment of a special counsel.     With 52 seats in the Senate, Republicans can still confirm the nominee on their own along partisan lines. But Republicans who have expressed concerns about Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign could choose to resist.          The FBI’s investigation of Trump associates’ potential ties to Russia has been continuing apace, and in recent weeks Mr. Comey had been receiving regular updates on its progress, according to people familiar with the matter.     In closed-door meetings with congressional intelligence committee members, Mr. Comey had provided updates on the probe’s progress. Some had expressed frustration that the director wasn’t more forthcoming with information.     At the same time, congressional investigators from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have also been intensifying their own probes.      Lawmakers are considering issuing subpoenas of witnesses, who were directed to hand over documents and records of their own contacts with Russian officials, according to people familiar with the matter.     Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman         Mark Warner    (D., Va.) called Mr. Trump’s decision shocking and said it was “deeply troubling” during an active counterintelligence investigation into improper contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russia.     “The only way this administration can begin to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law, which has so far been sorely lacking, is to cooperate fully with the ongoing congressional investigations and to support the appointment of an independent special counsel,” Mr. Warner said.     Republican Sen.         John McCain    of Arizona said he was disappointed in Mr. Trump’s decision and reiterated his calls for a special congressional committee, apart from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees already conducting probes, to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.                                         President Donald Trump was asked about the sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey during a photo session with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. On Capitol Hill, Vice President Mike Pence took tough questions about Comey's ouster.

He didn’t mention the possibility of appointing a special counsel.     Most other Republicans in Congress stopped short of calling for a special counsel, setting up the issue as a potentially rancorous source of conflict between the two parties for weeks to come.     Sen.         Marco Rubio    said it was for others to decide whether a special prosecutor was merited. The Florida Republican, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the panel’s investigation into the election would continue unaffected.     Sen.         Bob Corker    (R., Tenn.) accepted the case for Mr. Comey’s removal as “thorough” but said the timing would raise questions.     “It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time,” Mr. Corker said.     Sen.         Susan Collins,    a Republican from Maine, said she didn’t expect the dismissal of Mr. Comey to affect the FBI’s investigation.     “The president didn’t fire the entire FBI. He fired the director of the FBI,” Ms. Collins said in an interview on PBS. “I have every confidence that the FBI will continue pursuing its investigation into the Russian attempts to influence the elections last fall.”     Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, made increasingly vociferous calls for a special counsel, decrying Mr. Trump’s behavior as alarming, threatening and Nixonian.     Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), called on Mr. Trump’s deputy attorney general to appoint a special counsel. Otherwise, he said, Americans will “rightly suspect” the firing is a coverup.     “Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system, which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,” Mr. Schumer said at a press conference.     “This investigation must be run as far away as possible from this White House and as far away as possible from anyone that President Trump has appointed,” Mr. Schumer added.     Rep.         Adam Schiff,    the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Trump’s decision to dismiss Mr. Comey without addressing the profound conflict of interest regarding the Russia investigation resembled a “similarly tainted decision by Richard Nixon.”     “The same president who has called the investigation into the Russian hacking of our democracy and the potential complicity of his campaign a ‘fake’ cannot pretend to have made such a decision uninfluenced by his concerns over Comey’s continued involvement in the investigation,” Mr. Schiff said.     —Janet Hook and Byron Tau contributed to this article.
