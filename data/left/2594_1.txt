Rep. Mick Mulvaney has been picked as director of the Office of Management and Budget for President-elect Donald Trump, the transition team confirmed Saturday morning.One of the founding members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, the South Carolina Republican is a fierce fiscal conservative. An aide to the transition team indicated Mulvaney would be tapped Friday night. Unlike some Republicans, he has pushed to slash spending on both domestic and defense programs since he was elected to the House in 2010 — in contrast with Trump, who has called for boosting the Pentagon's budget and building up the military. Mulvaney will play a crucial role in shaping Trump's early agenda, including through drafting the president's first budget.Approval of major regulations also goes through the budget office, which would make Mulvaney a key figure in GOP efforts to pare back President Barack Obama’s federal regulations.“We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,” President-elect Trump said in a statement. “Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation’s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.”“It is a great honor to be appointed Director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Mulvaney said in a statement sent out by the transition team. “The Trump administration will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington after eight years of an out-of-control, tax and spend financial agenda, and will work with Congress to create policies that will be friendly to American workers and businesses.”Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted a statement Saturday saying Mulvaney is "the absolute right choice" to lead the OMB, calling him "a conservative reformer from day one."
