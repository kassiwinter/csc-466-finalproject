Trump criticized the program that allowed the suspected terrorist, Sayfullo Saipov, into the United States who allegedly killed eight and injured 11 people with a rented Home Depot truck on Tuesday.

The program was part of a bill introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., while he was still serving in the House of Representatives.
The president appeared to be watching Fox and Friends for updates about the attack, quoting a guest on the show.
”’Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems,’” said Col.Tony Shaffer,” Trump wrote. “We will stop this craziness!”
