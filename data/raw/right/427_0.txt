A moderator reminded 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that a question was about race Thursday night at the Democratic debates.Moderator and PBS broadcast journalist Amna Nawaz refocused the Vermont senator’s attention to race after Sanders attempted to steer her question toward climate change. Her question followed 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang pointing out that he was the only candidate of color on stage. “I’ll answer that question, but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment, because I do believe this is the existential issue,” Sanders told Nawaz.
