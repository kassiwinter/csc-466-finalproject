Congressional MemoSept. 18, 2013WASHINGTON — After three years of cajoling, finessing and occasionally strong-arming his fitful conservative majority, Speaker John A. Boehner waved the white flag on Wednesday, surrendering to demands from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after Sept. 30 to stripping President Obama’s health care law of any financing.Mr. Boehner knows that the plan he unveiled cannot pass the Senate, and that it may prove unwise politically and economically. His leadership team pressed just last week for an alternative. But with conservative forces uniting against him, he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate — and few good options to stop a government shutdown in two weeks.“Today was a step forward, and a win for the American people,” said Representative Tom Graves, the Georgia Republican whose “defund Obamacare” push had amassed 80 House supporters, a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome.With much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month — and run out of borrowing authority by mid-October — Mr. Boehner faced a choice: he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with Republican and Democratic votes, or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the Affordable Care Act of financing, unite his Republican majority around that war cry, and hope for the best.House conservatives let Mr. Boehner know that any solution that could not attract a majority of the Republican conference could cost him his speakership. Divided Senate Republicans made clear that linking further government spending or a debt ceiling increase to gutting the health care law would never get through the Senate. In March, the speaker himself said: “Do you want to risk the full faith and credit of the U.S. government over Obamacare? That’s a very tough argument to make.”On Wednesday, the speaker announced his choice.“The law’s a train wreck,” he said. “It’s time to protect American families from this unworkable law.”The House’s stopgap spending measure would finance the government through Dec. 15 at the current spending levels, which reflect the automatic spending cuts that took effect in March, known as sequestration, while blocking the health care law, under which the uninsured will be enrolled beginning on Oct. 1. If the bill clears the House on Friday, Republican leaders could put forward a measure as soon as next week that would raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit. That bill would also take aim at the Affordable Care Act, with a one-year delay of its provisions coupled with a one-year increase in the debt ceiling. It would also expedite the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code, and possibly include some other Republican wishes, like specific spending cuts and regulatory changes.For Mr. Boehner, the announcement Wednesday was a humbling moment, and possibly a defining one. Since the Tea Party wave swept Republicans to power in 2010, the beleaguered speaker has often found himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference. In late 2011, he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explained via telephone how it had to give up its opposition to extending a cut in the payroll tax.ImageCredit...Gabriella Demczuk/The New York TimesThree times this year, on major pieces of legislation, the speaker has put what he believed to be the greater needs of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right wing. In January, the House passed legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increases on virtually every American — but let taxes rise on the wealthy — with Democratic votes and a minority of votes by Republicans. The same math passed relief for Hurricane Sandy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.This time around he was contrite, quoting a plaque that graced the speaker’s office of Newt Gingrich: Listen, Learn, Help and Lead.“The key to any leadership job is to listen,” Mr. Boehner said.Mr. Gingrich, of course, was deposed by an angry coup after Republicans lost seats in midterm elections during the second term of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton. This time, the ground troops simply got their way with Mr. Boehner, providing new evidence that the Tea Party has changed Washington, not the other way around.As has been the case with each fiscal crisis since the Republicans took control of the House, Mr. Boehner’s decision was an embrace of short-term tactics over long-term strategy. How either the spending or the debt limit measures will become law is anybody’s guess.“Look, I think you could get all of us in the Senate to support it,” Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said of his Senate Republican colleagues. “The problem is, what is the Democrat majority going to do with it? That’s the challenge.”Even the man who started the “defund Obamacare” boomlet, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seemed to accept Senate reality on Wednesday, putting the onus on House Republicans to stand and fight. “Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so,” Mr. Cruz said. “At that point, House Republicans must stand firm.” Mr. Obama was visibly irked by the speaker’s decision. “You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a president or a governing party, and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt,” he said at the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the nation’s largest companies.Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a consistent ally of the Republican majority, questioned the House’s course. Democrats were gleeful at the potential political consequences. Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said House Republicans set off Wednesday on a kamikaze mission, with their speaker in the pilot’s seat. “They’re living in right-wing fantasy land” if they expect Democrats to take the blame for the chaos that could ensue, he said.But victorious House conservatives did their end-zone dance and evinced no worries about the final outcome.“Even the best coaches in the N.F.L. only script out the first two series of plays,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, when asked how the speaker would play out the sequence of events. “They don’t script the whole game. We’ve got to play the game. We’ve got to see how it all shakes out.”
