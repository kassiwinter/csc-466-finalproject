Overseas crypto exchanges providing services in mainland China are also illegal, the PBOC said."Overseas virtual currency exchanges that use the internet to offer services to domestic residents is also considered illegal financial activity," the central bank said, according to a CNBC translation of the comments. Workers at foreign crypto exchanges will be investigated, it added.The PBOC said it has also improved its systems to step up monitoring of crypto-related transactions and root out speculative investing."Financial institutions and nonbank payment institutions cannot offer services to activities and operations related to virtual currencies," the central bank said, reiterating past comments.The price of bitcoin sank over 6.5% in 24 hours, last trading at around $41,882, according to Coin Metrics data at midmorning Friday ET.
