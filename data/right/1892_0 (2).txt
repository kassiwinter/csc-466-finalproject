                                                                                                                                         PARIS (AP) — France opened a terrorism investigation after an attack at a gas factory Friday left one person decapitated and multiple people wounded, officials said. One official said banners with Arabic writing were found near the body.                                                                                                                                                      Two French officials said the attack began mid-morning when two men crashed a car into the entrance of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southeastern France, hitting gas canisters and touching off an explosion.                                                                                                                                                      One of the attackers was arrested, they said. It was unclear what happened to the other attacker.                                                                                                                                                                    The decapitated body and banners with Arabic inscriptions were found near the factory entrance, one of the officials said.

In a statement, France’s anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, which he said was carried out by “a terrorist group.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 France went on high alert after an attack in January that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including the Islamic extremist attackers.
