    The Obama campaign is hitting back hard in response to a Romney ad in which the GOP candidate presents himself as more moderate on abortion rights, explaining that he thinks that abortion should be legal for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, or if life of the mother is in jeopardy.      The Romney campaign says that’s long been his position, and Republicans accuse the Obama campaign of distorting his views. In at least one earlier ad, the Obama campaign charged that Mitt Romney is opposed to all abortion.      To support their point, Democrats point to a Republican debate during the primaries, where Mr. Romney said he would be “delighted” to sign a bill outlawing all abortions.     The new Obama ad , which is airing in Virginia, consists largely of replaying that question and answer. The Obama campaign said its ad was only airing in Virginia because the Romney ad is only airing there.          “If Roe v. Wade was overturned, Congress passed a federal ban on all abortions, and it came to your desk – would you sign it? ‘Yes’, or ‘no?’” asks CNN’s Anderson Cooper.     “Let me say it: I’d be delighted to sign that bill,” Mr. Romney replies.      A Romney campaign official replied that the Obama ad distorted his comment at the debate. His full response was: "I'd be delighted to sign that bill. But that's not where we are. That's not where America is today."     The dueling ads are a fresh indication of the importance of the women’s vote. The Obama campaign has long worked to paint Mr. Romney as a social conservative, pointing to his opposition to abortion rights as well as his promise to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The Romney response has typically been that women care more about the economy than they do about social issues, but the Romney campaign’s decision to run a TV ad on the subject of abortion and contraception shows the attacks are taking a bite.
