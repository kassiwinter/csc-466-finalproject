                                          By Robin Eberhardt - 07/26/17 12:02 PM EDT                                                        A retired transgender Navy SEAL called out President Trump on Wednesday for his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, urging the president to tell her to her face that she is not worthy of serving."Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy," Kristin Beck told Business Insider Wednesday, referring to Trump. "Transgender doesn't matter. Do your service."Beck was a Navy SEAL for 20 years, serving with the elite Team 6, among others. She was deployed 13 times and served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Business Insider.She added that she doesn’t think it’s right for people in the military to defend liberty for only some Americans.She also dismissed the argument that unit cohesion would suffer from transgender people serving alongside service members who might have problems working with them."A very professional unit with great leadership wouldn't have a problem," Beck said.Trump announced in a series of tweets Wednesday that the Pentagon would not allow transgender people to serve in “in any capacity” in the military, citing the “tremendous” medical costs.
