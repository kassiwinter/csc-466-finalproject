WASHINGTON—The House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a broad resolution condemning hate in all forms, a response to a freshman Democrat’s remarks that were seen as anti-Semitic, but the move also exposes the rift that is roiling Democratic leadership as it struggles to find common ground with its newly emboldened progressive wing.At issue were comments from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), who last week spoke of people who “push for allegiance to a foreign country,” which many listeners viewed as referring to Israel. The resolution—which passed 407-23, with Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa) voting “present”—denounced hate and bigotry in all forms, including anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and white nationalism. While it doesn’t directly mention Ms. Omar, who is a Muslim, it springs from a debate between leadership and members that flared after Ms. Omar’s comments on Jews and Israel.     The resolution had initially been drafted to condemn anti-Semitism, but following a tense closed-door meeting of Democrats on Wednesday, language condemning anti-Muslim bias was added at the request of lawmakers in the party’s progressive wing who said Ms. Omar had been unfairly singled out, underscoring the debate taking place within the Democratic caucus.               President Trump, who has criticized Ms. Omar’s comments, said Friday of the vote, “Democrats have become an anti-Israel party, they have become an anti-Jewish party, and that’s too bad.”                                                  The final vote count                  Photo:            C-SPAN                                                                                                             Ms. Omar, who voted for the resolution, called it “great progress” in a statement with the other two Muslim members of Congress, as it was the first time the House had voted against anti-Muslim bigotry.     A Somali refugee, Ms. Omar immigrated to the U.S. when she was 12 and served as a policy aide to the Minneapolis City Council before winning election to the state Legislature in 2016. In Congress, she has joined her party’s left flank as a vocal advocate for single-payer health care, gun control and expanding U.S. immigration.     In her first months in Congress, she has faced a backlash for repeated comments about U.S. policy toward Israel and money in politics, most recently in a public forum last week, that some people describe as anti-Semitic and have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. The reverberations in particular have revealed divisions in the Democratic caucus still navigating its new majority position in the House.     “It was also clear from the discussions this week—and in the ultimate resolution—that many people treat anti-Semitism differently than other forms of bigotry and hatred,” said         Josh Gottheimer    (D., N.J.), who is Jewish. “There shouldn’t be an asterisk next to anti-Semitism—and I will continue to fight it and any form of prejudice, no matter who says it.”     “We’ve got a lot of new members that haven’t been in this position before,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D., Mich.), the chief deputy whip, acknowledging there is a reason to be concerned, but not panicked about how the first two months of the Democratic majority are going.     Republicans have been quick to call out Democrats over their own infighting over how to condemn anti-Semitism and have called on Democratic leadership to remove Ms. Omar from her House Foreign Affairs Committee post.      “A watered-down condemnation of hate does little to alleviate the hurt caused by Rep. Omar’s continuous anti-Semitic rhetoric and beliefs,” said Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.).                                         Both Republicans and Democrats have some incentive to work together on a plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. But the opportunity for bipartisan action is ending quickly. WSJ's Gerald F.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), asked during her weekly briefing if Ms. Omar should apologize or if she thought Ms. Omar’s words were offensive, defended the freshman congresswoman.     “I don’t think that the congresswoman perhaps appreciates the full weight of how it was heard by other people, although I don’t believe it was intended in any anti-Semitic way,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters.     Jeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Ms. Omar, said the congresswomen was trying to say there is a distinction between criticism of a particular faith and fair critiques of lobbying groups, and that “to suggest otherwise is an inaccurate reading of her remarks.”     Some Jewish leaders in her home state of Minnesota say Ms. Omar’s comments are becoming too repetitive to be accidental. They have met with her repeatedly and made their views known after statements she has made this year and in the past.     Last month, when she apologized for a tweet linking Jews with money, and said she was still learning, that rang untrue to Minneapolis state Sen. Ron Latz, who lives in Ms. Omar’s district.     “She claimed ignorance about the impact of what she was saying,” he said. “I was thinking, wait a minute, she can’t claim that, I met with her.”     In June 2018, when Ms. Omar was running for her House seat, Mr. Latz invited her to his home, along with other Jews in the area, to discuss a tweet she sent in 2012 that said, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The tweet recalled an anti-Semitic trope that Israel and its supporters were secretly tricking the world into supporting it.     He said she was generous with her time in the two-hour meeting, though she didn’t apologize for the tweet until January of this year, when pressed. The two briefly crossed paths in the state Legislature and discussed working on net neutrality and tech privacy issues.     A person familiar with the meeting last year said Ms. Omar was meeting with Mr. Latz and others who weren’t supportive of her House race, as part of her continuing effort to meet with people with whom she doesn’t agree.      After Ms. Omar apologized for her comments in February, Steve Hunegs, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, met with Ms. Omar. It was one of several meetings the two have had over the years.     Mr. Hunegs said he brought with him a photo of his cousin, a Jewish American who was killed in World War II, intending to help her to understand the pain he felt when he felt his patriotism was questioned.     “I presented the point starkly to her,” he said, adding he was appalled to see Ms. Omar make comments just days later referencing allegiance to a foreign country. “Nobody learns the first time, and it takes time for people learn, but it is discouraging.”     Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
