                                                                                                                                         A device — possibly a drone — was discovered and recovered on the White House grounds, though spokesman Josh Earnest says not to worry: There’s no threat.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Earnest said he couldn’t confirm if members of the first family were home at the time of the device’s discovery, the McClatchy Washington Bureau reported. Fox News reported President Obama and his wife were in India, but that daughters Sasha and Malia did not travel with them.                                                                                                                                                      The discovery of the device comes as the Secret Service has been fielding widespread fire for lapses. In September, a man jumped over the fence that surrounds the White House grounds and actually ran into the building through an unlocked door.                                                                                                                                                         The device was found Sunday; Mr. Earnest announced its discovery Monday morning. He also said the Secret Service would give further details later as soon as possible. It’s not clear where the device was found, but its discovery prompted an increased security presence on the executive grounds, NBC Washington reported.
