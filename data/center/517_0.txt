               In 1994, eight years after Americans celebrated the first          Martin Luther King Jr.     Day, Congress made the annual federal holiday more than just a break from work. The holiday officially became a national day of service. “A day on, not a day off” is the official motto. Congress tasked the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that helps lead service, volunteering and grant-making efforts, with making the day of service a reality.           Each year, the agency and the King Center in Atlanta join nonprofit organizations, other government agencies and faith-based and community groups to coordinate projects across the U.S. Here’s a look at how some people celebrated the day, observed on the third Monday in January, over the years. --Talal Ansari                                                 President Reagan signed the bill making Dr. King’s birthday a national holiday, as Coretta Scott King looks on alongside Vice President George H.W.
