British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is travelling to Washington on Sunday to discuss the matter with White House officials.

Iran branded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a liar and said the documents he produced were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog.But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents were authentic and showed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was "built on lies".Mr Trump is already unhappy that the current deal only limits Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and does not stop the development of ballistic missiles.He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used "as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression" across the Middle East.Economic assets frozen by sanctions were returned to Iran under the terms of the deal. Iran has consistently denied US claims that it sponsors militant groups.Media caption, A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran dealEarlier this month, he said it was important to keep the deal "while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US".On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu again spoke out against Iran, saying it was better to confront Tehran sooner rather than later.Addressing a cabinet meeting, he accused Iran of supplying advanced weapons to the Syrian government that posed a danger to Israel. He added: "We are determined to block Iran's aggression against us even if this means a struggle. Better now than later."More on this story
