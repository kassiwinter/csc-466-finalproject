WASHINGTON—Top officials responsible for the security of the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack by Trump supporters told a congressional panel on Tuesday that faulty intelligence hampered their ability to prepare for the deadly riot.Testifying before a joint bipartisan committee of senators, former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned after the attack, blamed the disaster in part on what he called intelligence failures by federal law-enforcement agencies that supported predictions of a pro-Trump rally that day similar to recent ones in Washington. He also faulted excessive bureaucracy for delays in deploying the National Guard, though another top security official disputed specifics of his account. “A clear lack of accurate and complete intelligence across several federal agencies contributed to this event, and not poor planning by the United States Capitol Police,” Mr. Sund said. “Based on the intelligence that we received, we planned for an increased level of violence at the Capitol and that some participants may be armed. But none of the intelligence we received predicted what actually occurred.”      In questioning, Mr. Sund also said he had never seen a Jan. 5 report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Norfolk, Va., field office that detailed specific threats for the following day, including a rallying call for war and the sharing of maps of the Capitol. He testified that he had only learned over the past 24 hours that his department had received it. On the eve of the attack, he added, he held a call with top law-enforcement officials, including the FBI. “Nothing was mentioned of it,” he said.               Washington’s acting police chief, Robert Contee, said the FBI could have done more to warn his agency. While the agency shared its report in an email on the evening of Jan. 5, he said, “I would certainly think that something as violent as the insurrection of the Capitol would warrant a phone call or something.” An FBI spokeswoman said the bureau followed “our normal process” and “collected and shared available intelligence prior to the events of Jan. 6.”                                                 Sens. Gary Peters (D., Mich.) and Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) speak before the start of the joint hearing on Tuesday in Washington.

Gary Peters (D., Mich.) and Rob Portman (R., Ohio), the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and         Roy Blunt    (R., Mo.), chairwoman and ranking member of the Rules and Administration Committee.      The hearing is part of a wider bipartisan probe into the security failures that resulted in the breach of the Capitol by a mob of former President      Donald Trump’s        supporters that included members of far-right extremist groups. Five people died, including a rioter shot by police and a Capitol Police officer who succumbed a day later.     Four government watchdogs and several congressional committees are currently scrutinizing a law-enforcement response that amounts to one of the biggest lapses since the federal security apparatus was overhauled following the Sept. 11 attacks nearly two decades ago.      Republicans and Democrats said Congress needed to answer key questions to make the Capitol safe in the future, from why it took so long to call in the National Guard to whether there was credible intelligence about the attack before it happened.     Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said the hearing could serve as an opening into a larger “commission-like effort” that would fully investigate the circumstances leading to the riot. House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) has called for a 9/11-style commission to investigate what precipitated the security failure.     Former House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving also blamed poor intelligence for the chaos on Jan. 6. In written testimony, he said the Capitol Police relies on intelligence from federal agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, “neither of which assessed or forecast a coordinated assault on the Capitol like the one that took place.”     Meanwhile, the Capitol Police’s own intelligence branch, in the days leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day itself, “issued a daily intelligence report in which it assessed the potential for civil disobedience and arrests as ‘remote’ to ‘improbable,’” Mr. Irving said.                                                 Robert Contee III, acting police chief for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, speaks remotely to the panel on Tuesday.

Like Mr. Sund, Mr. Irving and former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger said they hadn’t seen the report.      Ms. Klobuchar also cited Mr. Sund’s statements that intelligence had prompted him to expand a security perimeter and deliver more protective equipment to forces. “If the information was enough to get you to do that, why didn’t we take some additional steps?” the senator said.     “We expanded our perimeter,” Mr. Sund said. He also said he called Mr. Irving, the House sergeant at arms, at 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6, “while I was sitting in the command center watching things rapidly deteriorate,” to ask him to call in the National Guard, adding Mr. Irving replied that he needed to run the request up the chain of command.     Mr. Irving said his records didn’t reflect a phone call at 1:09 p.m., when he was on the House floor during the joint session with Mr. Stenger and the congressional leadership. “Had I received a call at that time, I had everyone with me,” Mr. Irving said. “We would have approved it immediately.”                                         The Wall Street Journal analyzed hours of video and audio from the Capitol riot to better understand how a mob of thousands overran police and attacked the U.S. Capitol.

When Mr. Sund made a request for the National Guard shortly after 2 p.m., “we approved it,” Mr. Irving said, without waiting for input from congressional leadership.     Mr. Portman asked the former congressional security officials to provide phone records related to the requests for National Guard assistance, citing the need to resolve discrepancies in their accounts. He also suggested that the Capitol Police forces didn’t have sufficient training or equipment.      Mr. Sund said he had pushed for every member of the department to have riot helmets but that the pandemic had led to manufacturing delays, though some were delivered prior to Jan. 6.     “Too late for many of those officers,” Mr. Portman replied.     Many senators reacted to the testimony by suggesting that the structure for securing the Capitol needs changing. Oversight is currently exercised by the Capitol Police Board, which consists of the House and Senate sergeants at arms and the architect of the Capitol, with the Capitol Police chief holding a nonvoting role.        
Capitol Security        “Today we saw a lot of problems with the structure itself, and a crisis moment where the structure actually got in the way of getting things done,” Mr. Blunt told reporters after the hearing.     The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that while information about the threat was shared before Jan. 6, a multipoint warning system broke down and failed to generate sufficient follow-up. Law-enforcement officials spotted and dismissed some signals while missing others entirely.     On Jan. 4, the heads of intelligence-sharing centers convened a rare national call to discuss alarming information they were gathering about the coming rally where then-President Trump was scheduled to speak. The Department of Homeland Security’s intelligence branch, responsible for monitoring threats online and sharing them with law enforcement, said it had “nothing significant to report” in a Jan. 5 summary reviewed by the Journal.      On the same day, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser urged federal agencies not to send additional forces without consulting local police, drawing on the city’s experiences during last year’s racial-justice protests in which heavily armed security forces clashed with peaceful protesters outside Lafayette Square near the White House.      Citing the Journal’s reporting, Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security sent a letter last week requesting the DHS intelligence branch to answer questions about “any intelligence or information sharing failures.”     A DHS spokesperson said the department is working to “improve our ability to...mitigate the threats posed by domestic terrorists” and countering violent extremism is a top priority for DHS’s new head, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.      Mr. Sund also noted that the head of the Department of Homeland Security didn’t raise the alert level for Jan. 6 and testified to hourslong delays in securing backup from the National Guard.

The first 150 members of the National Guard were not sworn in on Capitol grounds until 5:40 p.m., four and a half hours after I first requested them and three and a half hours after my request was approved by the Capitol Police Board.”     By then, U.S. Capitol Police Capt. Carneysha Mendoza had already had what she described as a harrowing and chaotic day. She told the senators she ended up with chemical burns on her face from the gas deployed during the riot and took command of the Rotunda as officers begged for backup to push the crowd out.     “This was by far the worst of the worst,” Ms. Mendoza said. “We could have had 10 times the amount of people working with us and I still believe the battle would have been just as devastating.”     Write to Rachael Levy at rachael.levy@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
