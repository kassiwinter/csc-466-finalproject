Alvarez/The Philadelphia Inquirer, via Associated Press                                                                                                Just how long can Rand Paul talk?                       Mr. Paul, the Kentucky senator and Republican presidential candidate with a strong following among libertarians, took to the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon with plans to talk and talk and talk to highlight                         his concerns over reauthorizing portions of the Patriot Act that involve surveillance.                       The legislation that Mr. Paul hopes to delay, the U.S.A. Freedom Act, would actually overhaul the Patriot Act — curtailing the government’s bulk collection of phone records, for example. But Mr.                         Paul has cast himself as the lone Republican presidential candidate                         who would safeguard civil liberties, and he knows that a filibuster is an effective way to spotlight the issue.                       “There comes a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer,” Mr. Rand said, beginning his speech at 1:18 p.m. “That                         time is now. And I will not let the Patriot Act, the most unpatriotic of acts, go unchallenged.”                       Mr. Paul, wearing a charcoal gray suit and dark sneakers, arrived on the Senate floor laden with binders and folders packed full of papers intended to sustain him well into the evening.                       “I’ve just taken the Senate floor to begin a filibuster of the Patriot Act renewal,” Mr. Paul wrote on Twitter, shortly after seizing the Senate chamber. “It’s time to end                         the N.S.A. spying!”                       After Mr. Paul had spoken for roughly an hour, his campaign sent out an email to supporters explaining his goals, and Mr. Paul and his team continued to promote his talkathon throughout the day over social media,                         using the hashtag #StandWithRand.                       “Senator Paul is a staunch defender of liberty and believes Americans have a right to privacy,” the email said. “The U.S. government has no place conducting these warrantless searches and                         should focus on gathering intelligence on suspected terrorists and foreign actors.”                       But just how long Mr. Paul could go without getting dry mouth or needing a bathroom break would determine the effect, if any, his effort would have. (Indeed, Mr. Paul barely sipped the glass of water placed                         on the desk in front of him.)                       The witching hour was midnight; if Mr. Paul could talk into Thursday, he could briefly delay a key procedural vote on a major trade bill, at which point his speech would become an official filibuster. More important,                         he could push back when the Senate can take up the U.S.A. Freedom Act, preventing lawmakers from heading home for the Memorial Day weekend.                       On Wednesday, the Justice Department told lawmakers in a memo that it would need to begin taking steps on Friday to wind down the bulk collection of phone records to ensure that it did not take in any such records                         if the program expires on June 1. The department did not explain what those steps would be, but it noted that in February, the last time a judge reauthorized the program, he had directed the government to                         apply by May 22 if it decided to renew it again.                       Mr. Paul’s performance on Wednesday was not his first filibuster attempt. In 2013, he used the nomination of John O. Brennan                        to lead the Central Intelligence Agency to oppose the use of drone strikes.                       That time, Mr. Paul received the help of many of his Senate colleagues, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, both of whom are also running for the Republican presidential nomination.                       And while Mr. Paul was again joined by some of his fellow senators Wednesday, including a few Democrats who share his privacy concerns and Republicans like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, it seemed unlikely that Mr.                         Paul could expect the full-throated support of his 2016 rivals. Mr. Cruz supports the compromise overhaul bill, and Mr. Rubio disagrees                        with Mr. Paul, advocating a complete reauthorization of the bulk data collection program.
