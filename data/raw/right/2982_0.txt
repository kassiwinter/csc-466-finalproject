                           Kamala Harris, 56, will enter the White House as the nation’s first female and first black vice president.
After wins in Georgia, Democrats cemented control of the U.S. Senate by the smallest possible margin, which means Harris, as vice president and president of the Senate, holds the tie-breaking vote. This new addition to her duties could have her presiding over some of the landmark legislation of the early Biden-Harris administration.
Before joining Joe Biden’s presidential ticket, Harris was elected as the junior senator from California in 2016 and, before that, presided over the country’s second-largest Justice Department, behind only Washington, as California’s attorney general. She sought to shed this image as California’s "top cop" in a bid to win over the Democratic Party’s left-wing during the presidential primary.
