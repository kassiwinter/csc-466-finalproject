       CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULTGetty Images     I don’t like the way that this is heading. From WAFB:Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced Friday, March, 13 next month’s Presidential Preference Primary has been postponed due to COVID-19 concerns. COVID-19 is commonly known as coronavirus. The primary was originally scheduled for April 4. Ardoin said the election will be postponed at least two months.No, I don’t like it at all. From the AP, (via the Athens Banner-Herald):John Barrow of Athens, a former Democratic congressman, and former Republican state lawmaker Beth Beskin of Atlanta both planned to challenge Justice Keith Blackwell for his seat on the Georgia Supreme Court in the May election. Then the court announced last Friday that Blackwell is resigning and his replacement will be named by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Blackwell’s announcement said he plans to remain on the bench until Nov. 18 — six months after the nonpartisan election for his seat. Yet when Beskin and Barrow showed up to qualify for the race this week, state officials said they had called off the election. “His seat is not vacant,” Beskin said Thursday, the day before the qualifying period to sign up for Georgia’s 2020 elections was set to expire. “We should be having qualifying for his seat right now. To cancel an election the day before qualifying, I don’t think it’s legal.” Barrow said canceling the election amounts to “the ultimate act of voter suppression” by depriving voters of a chance to elect one of the state’s most powerful judges. “They’re taking this election off the books before the event that authorizes them to do it,” Barrow said after filing suit Thursday in Atlanta.This is how it starts, and don’t think that more than a few Republicans haven’t looked at the polls, and at the news of the pandemic, and seen an opportunity for mischief in that confluence of events. I’m certain that it’s occurred to people inside Camp Runamuck. I don’t like where this seems to be heading. All’s I’m saying.
