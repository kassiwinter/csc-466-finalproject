President Trump's morning attack tweet was aimed at perennial enemy, CNN, and he's taken it to a new level.#FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2017If you don't recognize it, that's a clip from Wrestlemania 2007 (sources say) where Trump is unleashing on Vince McMahon, but it's been edited to show him pummeling CNN. Right on cue, the accusations flew that Trump is a violent man threatening the media."The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary." - @SHSanders45 6/29/17— CNN Communications (@CNNPR) July 2, 2017He's also got two new hashtags in there - #FraudNewsCNN and #FNN. In a tweet Saturday he teased that he would be changing the name.I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017The video was first posted on the President's personal Twitter account, but the official POTUS account retweeted it. CNN's Jim Acosta, who has been whining all week about supposedly being treated unfairly, replied solemnly.Reminder: The WH just said this a few days ago... that the president has never "promoted or encouraged violence." #Happy4thofJuly https://t.co/mNqYe6d9P5— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 2, 2017Isn't pro wrestling fake?— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 2, 2017Yes, Jim, pro wrestling is fake, which is what he's accusing your news of being. 
The President's supporters, though, are chuckling at the video.
