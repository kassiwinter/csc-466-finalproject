President Trump on Thursday continued his criticism of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to repeal and replace Obamacare—even after seven years of promising to do so. “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” he said.Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2017The comments come after McConnell expressed his frustrations with the president for having “excessive expectations” for his agenda.Speaking to the Florence Rotary Club in Kentucky earlier this week, McConnell said many of Trump's "artificial deadlines" are "unrelated to reality," and suggested that was because he was unfamiliar with how Washington worked.“Now our new president has of course not been in this line of work before. And I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,” McConnell said.“And so, part of the reason I think people feel like we’re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality and the complexity of legislature may not have been fully understood.” Trump responded directly to McConnell’s comments on Wednesday, tweeting, “Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?”Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so.
