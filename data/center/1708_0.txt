Newly reported Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. rose from a day earlier, while hospitalizations decreased slightly.
The nation reported 174,589 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, up from 141,999 cases Monday but down from 225,423 a week earlier.
At least six states including Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington didn’t update their Covid-19 data dashboards for Monday, Johns Hopkins said. This could lead to a data backlog that skews numbers in the following days.
Reported deaths were back above 2,500 Tuesday, at 2,727, according to Johns Hopkins data. That was up from 1,404 a day earlier, but down from a record 4,462 a week earlier. The national death toll surpassed 400,000 on Tuesday, having added 100,000 to the count in just over a month.
Tuesday’s hospitalizations were at 123,820, according to the Covid Tracking Project, down slightly from 123,848 on Monday. There were 23,029 people in intensive-care units.
Amid a slow start to the nation’s Covid-19 vaccination drive, more than 15.7 million doses have been administered as of Tuesday morning, including more than 2 million second doses, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Joe Biden, who will become the 46th president of the U.S. on Wednesday, plans to accelerate vaccinations by boosting supplies, matching the number of people who are eligible for vaccines to the number of doses available and hiring retired health-care workers, public health officers and others to administer the shots.
“This is an emergency,” incoming CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told The Wall Street Journal.
In total, more than 24.2 million people in the U.S. have been reported infected with the disease, and more than 421,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins data. World-wide, more than 96.3 million have been reported infected and more than 2.06 million have died, the data show.
