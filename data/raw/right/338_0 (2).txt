Never wanting to be outdone on the virtue-signaling scales of social justice, it would appear that LA County's infamous Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer (read all about her non-medical background here) has turned the dial to 11.KNX1070's Claudia Peschiutta reports that LA County has decided to reinstate the indoor mask mandate - regardless of vaccination status - following a rise in COVID cases.L.A. County Community Transmission of COVID-19 Increases from Moderate to Substantial; Reinstating Masking Indoors for Everyone - 1,537 New Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County and 3 Deaths.

As opposed to the mainstream media's narrative that it is Trump-loving, white-supremacist, conspiracy theorists that are not getting vaccinated, it turns out the unvaccinated are dominated by black and hispanic people...Oh and it gets worse... the numbers of unvaccinated Americans in LA County are dominated by young black residents...And of course, Ferrer could not possibly single out that cohort for "reprogramming" on the benefits of getting a vaccine... so unleash the mask mandates until everyone (and by everyone, we mean young black folks) in LA County is vaccinated.
