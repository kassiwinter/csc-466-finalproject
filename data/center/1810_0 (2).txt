Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent and 2016 presidential hopeful, blasted “too big to fail” financial firms Wednesday -- offering another sign that attacks on Wall Street aren’t likely to fade in the 2016 election.     His push for stricter curbs on Wall Street echoes calls by former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a likely Democratic presidential candidate, for dismantling large banks.      The middle class “is still suffering from the tremendous damage huge financial institutions and insurance companies did to them in 2008,” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference with Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.). “No financial institution should be so large” that it can put the economy at risk, he added.     Mr. Sanders and Mr. Sherman introduced a bill entitled the “Too Big To Fail, Too Big To Exist Act,” which would require financial regulators to name – and break up – financial firms whose failure would have catastrophic economic consequences. The line of criticism is nothing new for Mr. Sanders, who has introduced similar bills designed to dismantle big banks since 2009.          Large banks say they don’t receive unfair benefits from their size, and note that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law banned bailouts and established a regime for unwinding failing financial firms without taxpayer support.     "I fully expect Senator Sanders’ third attempt to break up banks to have the same impact as the previous two: zero,” Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, said in a statement. “Breaking up banks would be incredibly disruptive in the short run and anti-competitive in the long run.” Hamilton Place Strategies represents some large financial firms.     Still, large banks have struggled to rebuild trust in the nation’s capital following the 2008 financial crisis. In March, Mr. O’Malley wrote in the Des Moines Register: “The largest banks should be broken up into more manageable institutions,” adding that a string of multibillion-dollar settlements between banks and the government for crisis-related misconduct “have been nothing more than CEOs using shareholder money to buy their way out of jail.”     While Republican candidates haven’t gone so far as to advocate breaking up big banks, several have criticized Wall Street and said the largest banks remain “too big to fail” more than five years after the financial crisis.     But tough talk like Mr. O’Malley’s appeals to liberal Democrats, and could pressure former Secretary of State          Hillary Clinton    , the Democrat front-runner, to endorse tougher policies on Wall Street oversight on the campaign trail. Mrs. Clinton has embraced Democrats’ emphasis on income inequality, for instance by citing unfairly low tax bills of hedge fund managers, but she hasn’t taken a broadside at Wall Street. A Clinton campaign spokesman didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8
