BEIRUT—The collapse of Islamic State’s caliphate has delivered a crushing blow to the extremist group, but the conditions that nourished that insurgency and others in war-shattered Syria and Iraq remain perilously in place. Islamic State rose more than a decade ago from the ruins of Iraq by using public anger over poor governance, poverty and sectarian strife to draw recruits from marginalized communities. Iraq’s lawlessness offered fertile terrain for the insurgency to spread. After five years of war against the group in Iraq and Syria, the caliphate is gone, now that U.S.-backed Syrian forces have captured the militants’ last desert holdout in eastern Syria. And yet seedbeds of extremism remain in both countries, even after the military campaigns aimed at uprooting Islamic State.          “If you really want to hammer a nail in the coffin of         ISIS    in Iraq and Syria, you need to rebuild devastated societies, and help them reconcile,” said         Fawaz Gerges,    professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics and author of “The Rise and Fall of al Qaeda.”               President         Trump    has said the defeat of the group allows for the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria to leave. The pullout decision has been criticized by U.S. allies and prompted then-U.S. Secretary of Defense         Jim Mattis    to announce his resignation in December. The U.S. military now plans to keep a residual force of up to 1,000 troops in Syria, The Wall Street Journal has reported.               Gen. Joseph Votel,    the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, told a Senate panel in February that although Islamic State is dispersed and segregated, its leadership is alive and maintains fighters, facilitators and resources.     In a sign of Islamic State’s capability even as its forces hunkered down in the last dying corner of the caliphate, its sleeper cells have stayed active, assassinating at least 139 members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces since August, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.     In January, a suicide bomber from one of those cells killed at least 19 people, including four Americans, in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. Islamic State regularly targets Mosul and Raqqa, its two main former urban strongholds.     Such attacks are likely to pose a growing threat as the U.S. pulls out of Syria and leaves the remaining powers—the Assad regime, Iran, Russia and Turkey—to take on multiple extremist insurgencies in the shattered country.     The U.S. strategy may have helped crush the caliphate but has done little to fortify Syria against an extremist revival, according to         Aaron Stein,    director of the Middle East program at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, largely because the state itself remains so weak.           “Of course the U.S. puts pressure on ISIS,” Mr. Stein said. “But the U.S. can’t solve the issue inside Syria of failed governance, the inability to police borders, the inability to monopolize the use of force. Whenever the U.S. withdraws, the Syrian regime won’t be able to police its country.”     The Syrian regime has to some extent, and with ruthless violence, reinstated security in areas recaptured from the armed opposition. But violence persists, and the border is porous, allowing for fighters to move between Syria and Iraq.     On one day in July, Islamic State killed more than 200 civilians in a string of attacks in Sweida, a government-controlled area inhabited by Druze communities that have tried to stay out of the country’s war. In the attacks, Islamic State also kidnapped dozens of women and children, prompting public protests in Sweida over the lack of security provided by the Assad government.     Not only Islamic State poses a threat. Al Qaeda and its offshoots count tens of thousands of fighters in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.     In northwestern Syria, thousands of militants from         Hayat Tahrir    al-Sham, formerly known as the al Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, have taken advantage of a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey to seize most of Idlib province, where the group controls border revenue and administration.     Many Syrians continue to reject the government and violent Islamists alike. Even in the embattled rebel stronghold of Idlib province, residents have protested in recent months against both Mr. Assad and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the former al Qaeda affiliate.     But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has also long tapped into economic grievances in its propaganda material, and even infiltrated popular antigovernment protests in Idlib.     Adding to the combustible situation in Idlib is the arrival of dozens of female relatives of Islamic State fighters who have fled the fighting in eastern Syria, as tracked by The Wall Street Journal on messaging apps.      The battle against Islamic State in Syria was complicated by competing interests of the powers involved in the fight—a scramble for influence that will likely intensify after a U.S. drawdown.                                                 U.S.-backed forces ousted Islamic State from its last outpost in Syria, marking the end of a nearly five-year campaign.

The Assad government’s brutal crackdown on rebels may have created some stability, but it has also pushed many Syrians in the country into an opposition that is now populated primarily by extremists.     Iran has also fought Islamic State, but in the process undermined state authority by empowering Shiite militias and stoking sectarian tensions. Radical groups tap into these tensions to recruit loyalists.     And Turkey, which is concerned that another large-scale regime offensive could overwhelm its border with refugees, has been reluctant to clamp down on militants in Idlib, the main extremist hub in Syria, allowing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to hijack much of the province.     In their current recruitment efforts, Sunni Muslim extremists in Syria often rail against foreigners, particularly the Shiite Muslims of Iran. In a video from February, a preacher with Hurras al-Deen, a branch of al Qaeda in Idlib, rallied followers against “injustice” at the hands of the “oppressors,” and called for battle against Shiite militias.     Islamic State has repeatedly in its propaganda threatened Iran and Russia—in Persian and Russian—with attacks on their soil.     “ISIS and al Qaeda are symptoms of broken politics in the Arabic and Islamic world: sectarianism, repression, exclusion of the population, abject poverty,” Mr. Gerges from the London School of Economics said. “I don’t see any effort from local governments and regional states or great powers to tackle the structural causes.”     —Nazih Osseiran contributed to this article.
