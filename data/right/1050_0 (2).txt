                                                                                                                                         Internal memos from the Obama administration suggest Obamacare’s Web  problems are holding up the entire enrollment process, including the  phone and paper options that President Obama and top officials are  pushing as an alternative to the troubled HealthCare.gov website, according to a report by ABC News.                                                                                                                                                      “The same portal is used to determine eligibility no matter how the  application is submitted (paper, online),” an Oct. 11 memo from the  Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight says, according  to ABC.                                                                                                                                                      “The paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving  forward in the process and provides another option,” it says. “At the  end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.”                                                                                                                                                                    In public remarks, Mr. Obama and others have encouraged uninsured  Americans to pick up the phone or fill out a paper application to gain  coverage.                                                                                                                              On HealthCare.gov’s home page, a photo of a smiling women has been  replaced with graphics that steer people toward several enrollment  methods.                                                                                                                                                                 But ABC News’ revelation appears to throw cold water on the Obama  administration’s tips for circumventing the glitch-plagued federal  website, which is supposed to be fixed by the end of the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The federal website, which handles requests for coverage from 36  states, has gone down for hours on end in recent days because of  scheduled maintenance or because of outages on its Verizon Terremark  network.
