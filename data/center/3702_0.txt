WASHINGTON—President Trump ordered the declassification of sensitive documents related to the investigation into Russian election interference, a move that could eventually allow the public unprecedented access to a probe that he has repeatedly railed against.The declassification order pertains to FBI transcripts, text messages and other law-enforcement and intelligence material related to an active investigation into some of the president’s closest advisers. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced the investigation as a “witch hunt” and he and his allies in Congress have sought to undermine its legitimacy by painting it as politically motivated and tainted by bureaucratic abuse—an accusation that senior Justice Department officials have repeatedly denied.     The White House said the president made the decision in response to requests from members of Congress and to further public transparency. Legal experts and former government officials said the move represented an extraordinary level of presidential involvement in an investigation that has notched guilty pleas from five of Mr. Trump’s associates.               Mr. Trump on Monday ordered that more than 20 pages of a federal warrant used to obtain a secret wiretap on one of his former advisers,         Carter Page,    be declassified, as well as all Federal Bureau of Investigation interviews that went into obtaining the warrant.                                         When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word "Collusion" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment?

Mr. Trump also ordered that text messages from senior Justice Department and FBI officials be made public without redactions. Those officials include former FBI director         James Comey,    former deputy director         Andrew McCabe,    former FBI agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer         Lisa Page    and Justice Department official         Bruce Ohr.         Those officials were involved at the highest levels of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. They are frequent targets of criticism from Mr. Trump and his allies. All but Mr. Ohr have left government service. Messrs. Comey, McCabe and Strzok were fired, while Ms. Page resigned this year.     Special counsel         Robert Mueller,    who was appointed last year to lead the probe into Russian election interference after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, is also investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow during the campaign and whether the president sought to obstruct justice in firing Mr. Comey while the FBI’s Russia probe was under way.     Mr. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction of justice, while Moscow has denied election interference.     As president, Mr. Trump has the power to declassify material that he believes is in the public interest. A Justice Department spokesman said such a move triggers a review process to ensure national security and that the department was working to comply with Mr. Trump’s order. The Office for the Director of National Intelligence said it was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the president has identified.”     Former government officials said the documents wouldn’t necessarily immediately become public but would instead likely be transmitted to committees in Congress that have requested the information, particularly the House Intelligence Committee. Lawmakers could then choose to release the information. It also would become subject to freedom of information laws.     David Kris, former chief of the Justice Department’s national security division and founder of the Culper Partners consulting firm, said Mr. Trump’s action was “especially unprecedented” because he was overruling subordinates who had provided a redacted version of the surveillance application to Congress and because the order pertained to a continuing investigation of which Mr. Trump is a subject.      The order came three days after former Trump campaign chairman         Paul Manafort    agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the Mueller probe. And on Monday, in a signal that Mr. Mueller’s investigation was moving closer to the finish line, his office said it was ready for a federal judge to sentence Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Nov. 28.     Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to investigators about his calls with Moscow’s U.S. ambassador a month before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and prosecutors said he was cooperating in the investigation. If prosecutors are ready to sentence Mr. Flynn, that signals they don’t need his testimony in any trial or prosecution of any other defendant.     The secret surveillance of Mr. Page, which started in October 2016 and continued through at least June of the next year, is at the heart of a partisan battle over whether the FBI went too far in investigating potential ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia.     The surveillance was authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law used to obtain wiretaps and conduct searches of suspected foreign spies. Because FISA deals with espionage matters, it is one of the most closely guarded processes in the federal government and is overseen by a secret court.     Democrats on Monday contended that the declassification order was another salvo in a partisan battle being waged to protect Mr. Trump and discredit an investigation that has already resulted in guilty pleas or convictions of his former campaign chairman, his former national security adviser and several others involved in his campaign or his business.     “President Trump, in a clear abuse of power, has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.     Republicans allege that the FBI relied, at least in part, on allegations drawn from a dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent         Christopher Steele,    which was funded by Democratic-linked groups. Republicans have asserted the FBI didn’t fully disclose that fact to the FISA court and noted that Mr. Ohr’s wife worked for one of the firms involved in compiling the material.     The FISA application shows that the FBI told the court it believed that the person who hired Mr. Steele was “likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign.” The firm that paid Mr. Steele, Fusion GPS, specializes in opposition research. It was paid for by the Democratic Party and         Hillary Clinton’s    presidential campaign through an intermediary.     In February, Mr. Trump signed off, over the objections of top FBI officials, on the release of a memo written by House Republicans that alleged abuses in how law-enforcement officials sought surveillance of Mr. Page. Democrats then released a rebuttal, rejecting the contention that agents had a partisan motive.     In July, the Justice Department released a redacted version of the FBI’s application to monitor Mr. Page in response to public information requests and lawsuits filed by the news media. Mr. Trump is now asking for additional portions of the application to be released.     The version released in July made plain that Mr. Page was in the FBI’s crosshairs and that the Justice Department strongly suspected he might have been working with Russians to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Page has repeatedly denied being an agent of the Russian government.     Mr. Trump on Monday specified 21 pages of the FISA application be declassified. Those pages, according to the redacted version of the application, focus on Mr. Page’s links to and business dealings with Russia.
