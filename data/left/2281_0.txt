       (Christopher Dolan / Times and Tribune)  Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign brought in just $26 million in April as contributions plummeted from earlier months, another sign of his fading candidacy.The total was a little more than half the $46 million he raised in March. Sanders barely touched on the fundraising figure during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Sunday, instead focusing on the $200 million his campaign has raised altogether since he announced a year ago that he would run for president.“We have shown we can run a strong, winning campaign without a super PAC and without being dependent on big-money interests,” he said.But Sanders trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by a wide margin in total delegates with only about a dozen contests left, and last week he laid off hundreds of campaign workers and acknowledged that he is focused on influencing the party platform at its convention in July in Philadelphia.Sanders again made the case that superdelegates, the party insiders who can vote for whomever they choose at the convention, should factor in their states’ popular votes, and which candidate has a better chance of beating Republicans in the fall.Sanders trails Clinton by 275 pledged delegates but can count on the support of only 38 superdelegates, compared with 502 for Clinton, according to a count by the Associated Press. (The Sanders campaign says 42 superdelegates support him.)Flipping party leaders who have committed to Clinton could be difficult. Clinton has been shoring up their support for years and many publicly announced their support of her before Sanders entered the race.“We must have the strongest candidate to beat [GOP front-runner Donald] Trump, or another Republican, and I think the objective evidence is that I am that candidate,” he said. Sanders repeatedly does better than Clinton in hypothetical general election match-ups that pit each of them against Trump, but such polls at this early stage of a presidential race are rarely indicators of November’s outcome.Sanders has criticized party rules that allow hundreds of superdelegates to vote for whom they want, but as the primary season draws to a close he’s also begun to appeal to them and even promised that the national convention will be contested, though that appears unlikely.“It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 with pledged delegates alone,” Sanders said. “She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, the convention will be a contested contest.”With 546 pledged delegates up for grabs, California’s June 7 primary is the big prize left on the primary calendar. Sanders would have to win 65% of the remaining pledged delegates to secure the nomination before the convention.“That is, admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb, but it is not an impossible road to climb and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and for every vote remaining,” he said.
