WASHINGTON—Former         Trump    Deputy Attorney General         Rod Rosenstein    on Wednesday offered lawmakers a limited defense of the Russia investigation he oversaw, as he came under increasing criticism from Republicans.Mr. Rosenstein said he stood by his decision to appoint special counsel         Robert Mueller    to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any links between that effort and the Trump campaign, but said he didn’t know then of the alleged improprieties that have surfaced in recent months on aspects of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s handling of the investigation. “I believed at the time…and I still believe it was the right decision under the circumstances,” Mr. Rosenstein said in his most extensive comments about the investigation since leaving the Justice Department in May 2019. Asked if he would have stopped the investigation if he knew then what he knew now, Mr. Rosenstein said: “Based on what I know, no.”         Related        The hearing comes as the Justice Department has revisited several cases that stem from that FBI investigation, dubbed Crossfire Hurricane.                The Justice Department’s watchdog in December found “serious performance failures” in how the FBI handled its requests to secretly surveil one of the subjects of the investigation, former Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser         Carter Page.    The report also said the FBI was justified in opening its initial investigation.     The chairman of the Senate Judiciary panel,         Sen. Lindsey Graham    (R, S.C.), said he had initially supported Mr. Mueller’s appointment but had come to believe the FBI’s investigation was replete with errors and driven by animus against President Trump, echoing Mr. Trump’s own criticism of the probe. “We’re going to be talking about how it got off the rails, who’s responsible for it getting off the rails, and making sure that they are punished,” Mr. Graham said.      In a final report last year, Mr. Mueller’s team found numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign but didn’t establish any conspiracy or collusion between the two.     When Sen. Graham asked Mr. Rosenstein if he agreed that by August 2017 there was no evidence of collusion, Mr. Rosenstein said he agreed with the general statement, but that it was important to let the investigation be completed. Several former Trump campaign officials were charged in connection with Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, for lying to investigators or separate financial crimes.      Democrats said the errors identified in the FBI’s investigation reflected broader problems at the agency, rather than specific bias against Mr. Trump.     “The president and his allies have been trying to rewrite the special counsel’s findings since the day they were released, but ignoring or excusing what happened in 2016 is really very dangerous,”         Sen. Dianne Feinstein,    (D, Calif.), the ranking member of the committee, said.                                         Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges in July 2018 against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratic organizations and the Clinton campaign and distributing information intended to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Sen. Patrick Leahy    (D, Vt.) asked Mr. Rosenstein if he agreed that the FBI’s errors in Mr. Page’s surveillance didn’t undermine the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. “Yes, yes I do agree,” Mr. Rosenstein said.     Several Republicans asked Mr. Rosenstein why he signed off on that surveillance even though the FBI had withheld exculpatory material about Mr. Page, as the inspector general later found.      Mr. Rosenstein said he wouldn’t have done so had he known about those issues. “Every application that I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged,” Mr. Rosenstein said.      The FBI has implemented a series of changes to how it develops those applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.     The Justice Department has also moved recently to drop one of Mr. Mueller’s cases, against Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser,         Michael Flynn,    citing evidence the FBI mishandled the interview at the heart of the case. Republicans including         Sen. Chuck Grassley,    the Iowa Republican who previously led the committee, rallied to Mr. Flynn’s defense, and said Mr. Rosenstein improperly kept information from Mr. Flynn.     “It’s clear you were misleading me…when you suggested we should be satisfied with Flynn’s plea agreement,” Mr. Grassley told him, referring to a prior conversation the two had. Mr. Rosenstein said he was unaware of the exculpatory information at the time.      Last week lawmakers released a transcript of Mr. Flynn’s calls with the Russian ambassador, which were at issue in the criminal case, confirming that Mr. Flynn had urged the ambassador to refrain from escalating a standoff over sanctions levied by the outgoing Obama administration. When he pleaded guilty in 2017, Mr. Flynn admitted he told FBI agents otherwise.      Attorney General         William Barr    has appointed three separate U.S. attorneys to review aspects of the investigation and related 2016 intelligence issues, including         Jeff Jensen,    whose examination of the Flynn investigation led the Justice Department to move to dismiss that case. That request is pending before a federal judge in Washington.     The Wednesday hearing, entitled “Oversight of the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation: Day 1,” was expected to be the first of several on the topic. Republicans plan to issue dozens of subpoenas in connection with the investigation.
