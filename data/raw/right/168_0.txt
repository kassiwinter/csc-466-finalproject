It’s always difficult to determine precisely when an epochal event makes the transition from memory to history, but 2019 may well mark that moment for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. This week’s 18th anniversary can be seen as both the legal coming-of-age of the cohort born in the wake of al Qaeda’s assault and the generational passing of the torch from the children of the Cold War to the children of the war on terror. This fall, college students born after 9/11 began arriving on campuses across the nation for the first time, and in recent months, the first candidates born after those attacks began applying to join the ranks of the New York City Fire Department, still haunted by the loss of 343 of its members on that day. Similarly, military recruits born after 9/11 are now being deployed to the wars that the attacks sparked, as well as to Guantanamo Bay, where they will guard al Qaeda prisoners captured before the young soldiers were born.     For 23-year-old         Lachlan Francis,    the attacks are among the earliest memories of his Vermont childhood. “My daycare provider picked me and other students up in her minivan and brought us back to her house,” he told me. She “frantically tried to call her daughter, who lived in Manhattan at the time,” while the children “sat transfixed in front of the couch, watching the video of planes crashing into the Twin Towers over and over and over again.”                                                  Lachlan Francis, in a school photo from 2001.

Beau Garner,    who lived in Michigan and was just 3 on 9/11, said, “My only memory is my mom standing in front of the TV watching the news. I don’t remember seeing the towers fall or seeing President Bush address the nation. The only thing I remember is how it affected my mother. The significance of the moment was somehow passed onto me regardless of my lack of comprehension; 9/11 was not just an early memory for me, it’s my earliest memory, just a flash.”                For many, al Qaeda’s attacks marked a profound moment of growing up. “I just couldn’t understand why anyone would want to hurt so many people,” recalled         Kristin Camille Chez,    who was a fifth-grader in Florida in 2001. “They couldn’t possibly have known them all—what reason did they have?”      For         Kat Cosgrove,    an eighth-grader in New Hampshire at the time, the magnitude of the cataclysm sunk in only when she got home from school and realized there was almost nothing else on TV. “When I saw that MTV and VH1 were also airing it, that’s when I realized how big a deal it was and started to get scared,” she recalled. “It was suddenly not an adult problem but something that I was supposed to be paying attention to too.”     For         Lourdes Baker,    a tenth-grader in California in 2001, “It was the first time I completely understood that nothing is simple, some things never make sense, and sometimes horrible things happen for no reason at all. It was the end of my childhood.”     The attacks profoundly altered those children and students, like Ms. Baker, old enough to remember it. They have spent their adult lives in a post-9/11 world, and we are beginning to see how their perspectives were reshaped by that day.           Some who were young adults on 9/11—including the 37-year-old Democratic presidential hopeful         Pete Buttigieg    and his college classmate         Elise Stefanik,    the youngest Republican elected to Congress—are now weaving the day into their political narratives as they step onto the national stage. “A team of Saudis with box cutters torpedoed our innocence,” a young Mr. Buttigieg wrote in a Harvard student newspaper in 2003. “For one long winter, no one knew what the hell to do, except to vow that we would never be the same.” He joined the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2009 and deployed to Afghanistan in 2014.      We rarely know precisely how milestone events transform entire generations, even as we note the way that those who came of age during the Great Depression so often remained frugal and how those who lived through Vietnam and Watergate tended to doubt national leaders and institutions. We don’t yet know what the lasting impact will be of coming of age in a country engaged in seemingly perpetual war.

This generation’s country is neither the victor of the Cold War nor the hero of the 1991 Gulf War. Theirs is a world where pride in the bravery of America’s military and first responders has been tempered by ugly revelations about Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, black sites and torture.         More Essays                Theirs is a generation whose adulthoods have been shaped by decisions made in the immediate wake of 9/11, even as the U.S. has moved further from the mix of fear, patriotism and national unity that shaped those decisions. Every American who fought during the Civil War, World War I or World War II remembered how it began. Today, by contrast, the generation of Americans providing most of the troops to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq often have indistinct or even nonexistent memories of 9/11.     In the past, veterans rose to the Oval Office only long after their own wars were over; think of a World War I veteran like         Harry Truman,    who took office in 1945, or the World War II hero         George H.W. Bush,    who became president in 1989. Yet Mr. Buttigieg has put the 9/11 experience at the center of his campaign, evoking it seven times in a foreign-policy speech this spring. “I fear that someday soon, we may receive news of the first U.S. casualty of the 9/11 wars who was born after 9/11,” he said. That tragic milestone will certainly occur in the months ahead.     —Mr. Graff is the author, most recently, of “The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11,” published Sept. 10 by Avid Reader Press.
