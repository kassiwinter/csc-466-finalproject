Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Thursday said he favors a $1.5 trillion price tag for Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill, a spending package focused on social programs, which puts him far out of step with progressives who are threatening to tank a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill Manchin strongly supports.

Key Facts   Manchin said during a press scrum at the Capitol he communicated the figure in recent weeks to fellow moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and the White House, which favors $3.5 trillion in spending.    Manchin said he did not loop in left-wing members of his party on that proposal despite House progressives threatening to sink a bipartisan infrastructure bill – set to be voted on Thursday – unless there’s an agreement on the reconciliation bill.       Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a progressive senator, said he wants to look at the details of Manchin’s proposal but did not seem surprised at the number, telling Forbes it is not “out of step with where many of us assumed he would be.”      “Joe Manchin has never been shy about letting us know he wasn’t going to be comfortable with anything close to $3.5 trillion,” Murphy said, noting the announcement comes just ahead of the planned infrastructure vote: “It’s not beyond Joe Manchin to occasionally be strategic.”  Manchin did not offer a concrete timeline for when he would like to strike a deal with the White House and progressives but said “it’s going to take some time.”    Key Background Manchin and Sinema, the two holdouts on $3.5 trillion in spending, have outsized power to control Democrats’ agenda in a Senate divided evenly along party lines. Unlike most legislation, the reconciliation can pass with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The reconciliation package focuses on social programs like Medicare and the Child Tax Credit, while the bipartisan bill is centered on “core” infrastructure like roads, bridges and public transit.  Chief Critic “There’s no number. I don’t have a number. That’s what he tells you, but, you know, that’s not what, ultimately, is going to be the package,” Jayapal told reporters when asked about Manchin’s proposal.  Crucial Quote “I think those negotiations have started now, so… this has probably helped some things move loose,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), another leader of the Progressive Caucus, said of Manchin’s proposal. He also needled Sinema for not putting out her own proposal, telling Forbes, “Half of Manchinema has now shown us something. Waiting for the other half to show us something other than a designer purse.” Follow me on Twitter. Send me a secure tip. PrintReprints & Permissions
