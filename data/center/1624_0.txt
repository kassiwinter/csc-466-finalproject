Key Facts   The National Defense Authorization Act passed both chambers of Congress by wide margins (335-78 in the House, 84-13 in the Senate).    In his veto letter, Trump railed against lawmakers’ refusal to accede to his demands to attach a measure to the NDAA repealing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — which protects social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms, which he has said leads to censorship – as well as for their inclusion of a measure requiring the renaming of military bases named for Confederate generals.       Trump also cited provisions restricting his ability to use military construction funds for national emergencies – which he has used to build his border wall – and putting the brakes on his efforts to pull troops out of Afghanistan, Germany and South Korea.     Congressional leadership, which supported the bill, was bracing for a veto: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scheduled a veto override vote for Dec. 28 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell planned one for the next day.    The move comes a day after Trump hinted at vetoing a bipartisan Covid-19 relief package passed by Congress on Monday, citing foreign aid expenditures that are part of the omnibus bill the package is attached to and asserting $600 direct payments are inadequate, calling for $2,000 checks.     Trump has also criticized Senate GOP leadership for acknowledging Joe Biden as president-elect and attempting to quash efforts to challenge the Electoral College, going so far as to push a primary challenge against Senate Majority Whip John Thune.    Crucial Quote “It is a ‘gift’ to China and Russia,” Trump said of the NDAA after coming under fire from lawmakers in both parties for his tepid response to a cyber attack on multiple U.S. government agencies that officials have tied to Russia. After initially remaining silent on the issue, Trump speculated that the perpetrator may have been China – despite his own Secretary of State saying it was likely Russia – while downplaying the severity of the attack and tying it to his unfounded claims of election fraud. Chief Critic Pelosi called the veto “an act of staggering recklessness that harms our troops, endangers our security and undermines the will of the bipartisan Congress,” in a statement, vowing to “take up the veto override with bipartisan support” on Dec. 28 as planned. Tangent While Senate Republicans are poised to defy Trump in all three cases, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has shown far more deference to the bombastic president. On a call with his caucus, McCarthy said Trump has not yet decided whether to veto the stimulus bill but that House Republicans “need to address the president's concerns and keep parts of the bill they think are good,” calling it “tainted,” according to the New York Times. Key Background As his presidency nears its end, Trump’s behavior has become increasingly erratic and unpredictable – especially involving his continued false claims that he won the election. He has met with conspiracy theorists, including his former attorney Sidney Powell, who he reportedly mused about appointing as a special counsel to investigate his fraud claims. Advisers have attributed his increased combativeness to the departures of several top aides who, working together, were able to keep his impulses at least somewhat in check, according to the Times.  What To Watch For Trump is unlikely to prevail in most of his clashes with Congress. Given the overwhelming margins by which the NDAA was passed, a veto override seems all but inevitable. And even if Trump manages to recruit a senator to challenge the electoral vote tally, it will only succeed in delaying the process before the Democratic-controlled House ensures Biden’s electors get accepted.
