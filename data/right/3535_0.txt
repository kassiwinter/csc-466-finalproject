                  	Fox News President Bill Shine departs after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in the Manhattan borough of New York, November 21, 2016.     	(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)                     Update 6:09p.m.: ABC News, citing multiple sources, reports that Shine has accepted the White House communications director role.
Former Fox News co-president Bill Shine, who was ousted last May for his alleged failure to adequately address sexual harassment within the company, is expected to be offered the position of White House communications director, according to the New York Times. Shine has reportedly engaged in multiple talks with President Trump about the position, which has been vacant since Hope Hicks resigned in March. While the decision has not yet been made official, Trump has informally offered Shine the job and an announcement is expected at some point in the coming days.
Shine has had multiple meetings with the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in the past few months and met with him at the White House this week, according to Politico.       The decision to appoint Shine, who had a close relationship with disgraced Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, will likely arouse criticism from those concerned about the culture of the cable-news giant on his watch. A number of high-level Fox News executives and talent, including most notably Ailes himself, were swept up in allegations of workplace harassment, though Shine has denied responsibility for any wrongdoing.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was also offered the position but declined, according to the Times. Mercedes Schlapp, a White House communications advisor, was also reportedly under consideration but never received an offer from Trump.
