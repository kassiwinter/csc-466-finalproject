The doctor claimed that then-president had "incredibly good genes, and it's just the way God made him". Mr Trump later nominated him to be his Veterans Affairs secretary, but Mr Jackson withdrew his name amid allegations that he created a hostile work environment, drank on the job and handed out prescription drugs like "they were candy". The watchdog report released on Wednesday corroborates several of those allegations, with Mr Jackson's subordinates describing him as a "control freak" prone to "meltdowns" and a "tyrant" with the "hallmarks of fear and intimidation".It also laid out specific allegations of alcohol use by Mr Jackson on presidential trips under Mr Obama, harassing certain female colleagues while drunk.Witnesses also claimed the former physician frequently took the sleeping pill Ambien on long flights while on duty, although this is not a prohibited practice.Mr Jackson left his role on the medical team and retired from the Navy in 2019. He is now a member of the US House of Representatives from Texas.Disputing the Pentagon's findings, he said: "I'm proud of the work environment I fostered under three different presidents of both parties"."I take my professional responsibility with respect to prescription drug practices seriously, and I flat out reject any allegation that I consumed alcohol while on duty."He added: "Democrats are using this report to repeat and rehash untrue attacks on my integrity."More on this story
