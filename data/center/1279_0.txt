Adam Schiff's book based on Russia fiction Senate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG MORE's team erased some records from their official phones."These reports are troubling and raise concerns about record retention and transparency," Johnson wrote in a letter to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz. "Therefore, I respectfully request that your office open an investigation into this matter to determine what, why, and how information was wiped, whether any wrongdoing occurred, and who these devices belonged to."The letter comes after documents released by the Justice Department this week say information was scrubbed from at least 15 phones. The records cited forgotten passwords, physical damage to the phones and hardware issues to explain the erasures.Besides requesting that Horowitz open an investigation into the documents, Johnson is also asking for answers to a number of questions, including when the DOJ was made aware of the issue and if the inspector general has the ability to retrieve the information from the phones. He’s asking for answers to his questions by Sept. 18.Johnson is also winding down a related probe into the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's contact with Russians in 2016, an inquiry that ultimately transformed into Mueller’s probe. Sen.
