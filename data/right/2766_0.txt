(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) (The Associated Press)PARIS – France's far-right National Front party is gearing up for a name change — but not a makeover of its ideas — after its decisive loss to centrist Emmanuel Macron.In interviews Monday, the campaign director for Marine Le Pen, David Rachline, said the party founded by her father would get a new name as bait to pull in more supporters in France. Macron won the presidency with 66 percent of votes cast for a candidate. But a high number of blank or spoiled votes and unusually low turnout are signs of an electorate dissatisfied with its choices.Legislative elections next month will determine wither Macron can cobble together a governing majority.Rachline said Le Pen will lead the opposition to Macron.
