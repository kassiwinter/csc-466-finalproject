MOSCOW—President      Vladimir Putin        said Russia would target the U.S. with new advanced weapons if Washington deploys intermediate-range missiles in Europe, a threat that appeared aimed at holding the line but leaving open the possibility of negotiations after the breakdown of a nuclear treaty.Mr. Putin said Russia wasn’t seeking a confrontation with the U.S. and wouldn’t make the first move to deploy the missiles. But if Washington has such plans once it abandons the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, this “will be a serious threat to us” and Russia will be “forced to provide for mirror and symmetrical actions,” he said. The Russian leader also announced imminent plans to launch Russia’s first unmanned nuclear submarine. Still, he indicated that he remained open to nuclear-arms-control talks if the U.S. were to initiate them and many of Wednesday’s statements echoed past rhetoric by Russian officials.         Related        “If Putin is offering not to deploy new nuclear systems if the United Stated does not deploy new intermediate-range missile systems, that is the start of a conversation,” said         Daryl Kimball,    executive director of the Arms Control Association, an independent research organization in Washington, D.C.                “It’s the start of a potential deal of a no-first deployment arrangement that can mitigate the risk of a new arms race,” Mr. Kimball said.      Earlier this month, Russia said it would suspend its obligations under the INF treaty, and defense-ministry officials said work was under way to develop new missile systems, including a hypersonic long-range rocket. The move was in response to Washington’s plans to abandon the pact in six months if Moscow doesn’t destroy missile systems the U.S. says are in breach of the agreement.     The Russian president’s tough talk came toward the end of an almost two-hour annual address to the nation on Wednesday that mainly focused on the country’s economic development, with Mr. Putin promising to improve living standards and the social well-being of Russian citizens in the coming year.     During his speech, Mr. Putin accused the U.S. of being dishonest in saying that its withdrawal from the INF pact was triggered by violations by Moscow. The Kremlin has charged that Washington’s quitting the agreement has to do with U.S. desire to stockpile arms.     “American colleagues have already tried to gain absolute military superiority with the help of global missile defense,” Mr. Putin told his audience of senior lawmakers and politicians from Russia’s parliament. “We need to abandon these illusions.”     Mr. Putin said that by using medium-range target missiles and deploying launchers in Romania and Poland that he said are fit for launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, the U.S. had openly violated these clauses of the treaty.     A State Department spokeswoman characterized Mr. Putin’s comments as “a continuation of Russia’s propaganda effort to avoid responsibility for Russia’s actions in violation of the INF treaty.”     “The Aegis Ashore system in Romania and under construction in Poland are in full compliance with the INF Treaty, as NATO has stated, and not capable of launching offensive missiles like Tomahawk,” she said. “Furthermore, we are not pursuing similar development of exotic new nuclear weapons delivery systems.”     The weapons Mr. Putin highlighted in his speech include the hypersonic Tsirkon, a naval system that has been in development for many years for deployment from subs, ships and some aircraft, according to Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. The Russian president also boasted of what he described as the first nuclear submarine carrying the Poseidon nuclear-armed unmanned system, which he said expected to be launched this spring.                                         In 1987, the U.S. and Russia signed a nuclear-arms treaty banning land-based missiles capable of flying 300 to 3,400 miles.

Despite the bravado, the core of Mr. Putin’s speech centered on the country’s development.     He underscored the need to reduce poverty, which affects about 19 million of Russia’s 147 million people who are said to be living under the official poverty line, set at around $160 a month, according to official government data.     Mr. Putin pledged to introduce a package of initiatives to the Russian public, at a time when public trust in the Russian president has fallen to 33.4%, its lowest level in 13 years, according to January data published by the Public Opinion Research Center, a Russian state pollster.     According to national polls, discontent has been driven by the slow pace of economic growth, falling wages and an unpopular pension reform that has raised Russians’ retirement age.     Mr. Putin promised incentives—such as increased allowances to families with children, tax breaks and housing subsidies—aimed at increasing life expectancy and lowering the death rate, which have been directly linked to poverty.     “[Mr. Putin] seems to be fully aware that Russia can ill-afford to ramp up the arms race, but that there are enormous economic, infrastructure, and social challenges facing Russia,” Mr. Kristensen said.     —Michael Gordon and Courtney McBride in Washington, D.C. contributed to this article.
