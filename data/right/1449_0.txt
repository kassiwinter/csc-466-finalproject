                 | November 01, 2020 07:18 PM                President Trump said a report that claimed he would declare an early victory on election night if it looks like he's ahead was "false," but he will be prepared to start a legal battle to cut off collecting ballots.       "No, no, that was a false report," Trump told reporters Sunday night.            Three sources familiar with the president's private comments told Axios the president has considered the scenario over the past few weeks, saying that he would "walk up to a podium on election night and declare he's won."      The president's allies say he would either need to win or "have commanding leads" in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Arizona, and Georgia.      Trump said that it "wasn't fair" that the results of the election might not immediately be known.      The coronavirus pandemic prompted an unprecedented level of mail-in voting and expanded early voting across the country. In Texas, more people have voted before Election Day than the total number of voters in 2016. But, all those ballots have to be counted, and in 34 states, mail-in ballots are not allowed to be counted until Election Day. Seventeen of those states are not allowed to start counting until after the polls have closed, according to Ballotpedia.       Many states have expanded how long after Election Day they will accept ballots to be counted. In battleground states like Pennsylvania, where Trump eked out a win by less than 1 percentage point, those late-arriving ballots could be critical for either candidate to lock up a sufficient number of electoral votes.       "We’re going in the night of. As soon as the election is over, we’re going in with our lawyers," Trump said.       Jason Miller, an adviser to Trump, suggested Sunday morning that the administration might start a legal battle against including ballots counted after Election Day in order to prevent an attempt by Democrats to "steal back" the election.      "If you speak with many smart Democrats, they believe President Trump will be ahead on election night, probably getting 280 electoral, something in that range. And then they'll try to steal it back after the election," Miller said on Sunday. "We believe we'll be over 290 electoral votes on election night. So no matter what they try to do, no matter what kind of high jinks or nonsense they try to pull off, we'll still have enough electoral votes to get President Trump reelected."      Trump added that it was a "terrible thing" that ballots would still be counted after polls close.
