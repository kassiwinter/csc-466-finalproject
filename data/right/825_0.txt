 The Republican controlled Michigan legislature passed right-to-work legislation late Tuesday morning as union members loudly protested inside and outside of the Capitol in Lansing. Michigan Democrat Rep. Douglas Geiss threatened on the House floor this morning "there would be blood" if the legislation passed. Riot police have been on the scene since early this morning bracing for violence. The Michigan House Democrats reiterated their threat on their Twitter page, but have since deleted it. Outside of the building a tent owned and set up by the conservative group Americans For Prosperity has been torn down by cheering union protesters, trapping elderly volunteers inside.  
Conservative comedian Steven Crowder, who is in Lansing, has reported being punched in the face four times. According to reporters on the ground in Michigan, troopers in riot gear are headed to the steps of the Capitol to try and prevent any further violence.
