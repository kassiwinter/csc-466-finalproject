                 | January 22, 2021 04:26 PM                President Biden did not appear to object to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's request to delay former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.      “The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better," Biden told reporters on Friday at the White House.            After signing two coronavirus economic relief executive orders, Biden said he "hasn't heard the details" of McConnell's proposal to push Trump's trial to mid-February after the House sends the Senate its impeachment article on Monday. The article charges Trump with inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.      Only two of Biden's Cabinet members have been confirmed by the Senate: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. And there are concerns that the Senate's time will be monopolized by Trump's impeachment trial when it could be concentrating on brokering a third COVID-19 economic deal.      White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked multiple times during Friday's press briefing whether the Biden administration is concerned about how impeachment could complicate its agenda. She repeatedly said Biden and his team "believed in" the Senate and are confident the body can handle all of its responsibilities.       She reiterated Biden's idea that the chamber in which he served for decades could do two things at once by focusing on the trial for half the day and legislation and the president's nominees during the other half. Some Senate Democrats, however, have cast doubts about delaying the trial, saying the former president should be held accountable for what they say was his inciting the crowd of his supporters at a rally before the Capitol violence.      Biden defended his $1.9 trillion "American Rescue Plan" on Friday before signing the orders. He cited former top Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett's endorsement of the framework, claiming it "almost" wasn't a partisan package.      He also defended his administration's target of delivering 100 million COVID-19 vaccinations during his first 100 days in office.      "I found it fascinating. Yesterday, the press asked the question: Is 100 million enough? A week before, they were saying, 'Biden, are you crazy? You can’t do 100 million in 100 days.' Well, we’re going to — God willing — not only do 100 million, we’re going to do more than that," he said.
