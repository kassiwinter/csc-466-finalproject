                                                  President Barack Obama, shown here with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in September 2012, said Sunday that Mrs. Clinton's personal email set-up didn't endanger national security.

In his first extensive remarks on the controversy that has roiled the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Obama said on CBS’s “60 Minutes” program on Sunday that questions about Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement were legitimate.      "It is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public," Mr. Obama told CBS's Steve Kroft.     "When we're in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data. And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it," the president said.          At the same, Mr. Obama said her email arrangement didn’t put the U.S. at risk and said the issue had been politicized.     "The fact that for the last three months this is all that's been spoken about is an indication that we're in presidential political season," he said. "I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.”     While secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton used a personal email account run off her own email server. Critics say her actions made public records requests difficult and may have left sensitive national security information vulnerable to hackers.     Mrs. Clinton has said the State Department's rules didn’t forbid the use of a personal email account. Democrats have said that the congressional investigations into Mrs. Clinton have become increasingly partisan. The FBI is also investigating.     On Sunday, a Republican former staffer on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which has been investigating Mrs. Clinton’s email practices in a broader inquiry into the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic post in Libya, said the investigation had become overly political and focused entirely on Mrs. Clinton's emails.     Maj. Bradley Podliska, an intelligence officer in the Air Force Reserve, said he lost his job as an investigator on the committee partly because he resisted pressure to focus his investigation only into Mrs. Clinton and the State Department’s role in the attacks.
