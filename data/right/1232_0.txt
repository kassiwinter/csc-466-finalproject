                 | August 27, 2020 01:34 PM                 | Updated Aug 27, 2020, 02:36 PM                 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said there should not be any 2020 presidential debates.       And just like that, she has made the idea of canceling the election-year showdowns between President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden into something far more than just chatter among news and political commentators.             “I don't think there should be any debates,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday.       She added, “I do not think that the president of the United States has comported himself in a way that has any association with truth, evidence, data, and facts. I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him, nor a debate."       Pelosi is now the latest and most consequential voice on the Left to float the idea of canceling the debates. She joins a long, long list of left-wing commentators who have advised for months that Biden should back out of the scheduled events.       CNN analyst and former Clinton White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, for example, urged Biden in July, “Whatever you do, don't debate Trump. … It's a fool's errand to enter the ring with someone who can't follow the rules or the truth.”       “What could we possibly learn from three debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, besides the fact that it’s time we did away with them entirely?” asked the New Republic’s Alex Shephard.       Democratic strategist and former Hillary Clinton senior adviser Zac Petkanas added elsewhere that "Biden shouldn't feel obligated to throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all. This is not a normal presidential election, and Trump is not a legitimate candidate.”       “Biden should not debate Trump,” New York Times columnist Thomas Freidman counseled in early July, unless Trump agrees to release his taxes. Moreover, Biden must “insist that a real-time fact-checking team approved by both candidates be hired by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates — and that 10 minutes before the scheduled conclusion of the debate this team report on any misleading statements, phony numbers or outright lies either candidate had uttered.”       Later, in August, the New York Times published an op-ed titled simply “Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates.”       On Thursday, the Democratic speaker of the House threw her support behind these sentiments.       So, at what point can one say that, yes, Biden and his allies do not want him debating Trump? Because, you see, some journalists went to the mats earlier this year insisting that the idea that the Biden campaign would rather he not participate in the debates was a right-wing meme based on some brief chatter by newspaper columnists.       “Biden is very much willing to debate Trump this fall. In fact, his campaign has already agreed to the three debates with Trump,” said CNN’s Oliver Darcy.       He adds, “But speculation on Fox News and other right-wing media outlets has suggested otherwise. If you pay attention to this media universe, you know that stories about Biden skipping debates has totally saturated coverage. … Yes, there have been some NYT opinion pieces and brief chatter about why Biden should skip the debates. Personally, I've never taken the suggestions too seriously. It's always felt like these pundits are talking in theoretical terms.”       The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel said elsewhere, "The 'Biden wants to cancel the debates’ meme is a TV invention. Biden’s agreed to three debates, balked at a fourth. That’s it. 'He should not debate unless....' takes are coming from people like Thomas Friedman, who don’t actually work for Biden."      Weigel was not wrong, nor is he. No one on Biden’s team has said anything about canceling debates even now. But now, the most powerful Democrat in Washington has suggested doing exactly what Friedman, Lockhart, and others had already suggested. Pelosi obviously does not “work for Biden” and therefore does not speak for him. But it has to be at least a little bit annoying to see the Democratic speaker, the third in line to the presidency, embrace what was once characterized as a right-wing meme born of “brief chatter" by the commentariat.
