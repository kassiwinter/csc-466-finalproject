           Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump says he doesn't need the Republican Party to unify behind him to win the general election.
In an interview on ABC News' "This Week" released ahead of the Sunday show, the brash billionaire says he's not the typical politician.
"Does it have to be unified? I'm very different than everybody else, perhaps, that's ever run for office," Trump told moderator George Stephanopoulos. "I actually don't think so."
And he's not fazed by the refusal of some GOP leaders to back him, confidant he'll pick up "millions" of Democrats to help vault him into the White House.
"I think it would be better if it were unified, I think it would be – there would be something good about it," he says. "But I don't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense."
"I'm going to go out and I'm going to get millions of people from the Democrats," he added. "I'm going to get Bernie [Sanders] people to vote, because they like me on trade."           © 2022 Newsmax. All rights reserved.
