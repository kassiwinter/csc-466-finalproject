Politics came to a pause Friday as tragedy in Colorado trumped the partisan attacks that have come to define the political discourse.President Barack Obama cut short a campaign swing through Florida, canceling an appearance in Winter Park and scaling back his first event in Fort Myers following the shooting at a Colorado movie theater that killed at least 12 people early Friday. "There are going to be other days for politics," the president said. "This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection."     Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama also canceled campaign events, while the campaign asked TV stations in Colorado to pull negative ads from the air.               "It takes time for stations to be able to do this, but we are making every effort," Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.                                         Mitt Romney takes a moment out of his campaign to speak about the shootings that occurred in Aurora, Colo.

The campaign canceled a Michigan event scheduled for his wife, Ann, and said it would pull its TV ads in Colorado.           
On the Scene in AuroraDeadliest Mass ShootingsColumbine, Utoya, more.           Mr. Obama stepped onto the stage in Fort Myers more than half an hour earlier than scheduled. The crowd cheered, but the somber president quickly urged the audience to sit.     "I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country," he said. "But this morning we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways we are united as one American family."     The president reflected on how the tragedy resonates with him as a father of two young daughters. "My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at the theater?" he said. "Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight."     Mr. Obama vowed whoever is responsible "for this heinous act" would be brought to justice.     "Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason," he said. "If there's anything to take away from this tragedy it's a reminder that life is fragile…and what maters at the end of the day is not the small things, it's not the trival things….Ultimately it's how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another."     Mr. Obama led the crowd in a moment of silence to remember the victims. He then encouraged the audience to spend some time reflecting. "I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today," he said.     On Capitol Hill, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky canceled a noon press conference in the wake of the shooting. Aides hadn't disclosed what he planned to say, but he had spent the week attacking Democrats on fiscal issues. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), scrapped plans to deliver a partisan weekly address about jobs and instead planned to address the tragedy.     Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who has been mercilessly attacking Democrats in recent months, issued a statement saying in part, "As a country, we have shown time and time again that in moments of great sorrow, we come together as one."     And in Nevada, the state Democratic party postponed an event criticizing Republican Sen. Dean Heller.      —Carol E. Lee contributed to this article.
