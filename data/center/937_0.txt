WASHINGTON—House Speaker         John Boehner    said Thursday GOP leaders were crafting a strategy that could avert a September showdown with Democrats over government funding levels by deferring the toughest budget issues to later in the fall, when lawmakers face a deadline to raise the debt ceiling.The two parties had been expected to clash in September over funding for federal operations, ahead of the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. On a conference call Thursday evening with GOP lawmakers, Mr. Boehner said it was his "intent to move quickly" when lawmakers return to Washington in September to pass a short-term spending bill at current levels that keeps the government running for 60 to 75 days, which would last until early or mid-November, according to several lawmakers who were on the call.      Top aides to leaders in both parties in the Senate have said that such a measure could pass the Senate with relative ease.               Rep.         Chris Van Hollen    (D., Md.) said Democrats would prefer a yearlong spending bill that reverses across-the-board budget cuts that began last year, known as the sequester. But if an interim spending measure were put on the table, he said, Democrats would consider it.     Mr. Boehner met objections from several conservatives who want the spending bill to include a measure blocking funding for President         Barack Obama's    signature health-care law—a conservative demand that many lawmakers have heard at town hall meetings this summer.      A letter written by freshman Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.) and signed by 80 House Republicans was presented to House GOP leaders on Thursday calling on them to commit to stripping funding from the health law.     But GOP aides say Republican leaders in both chambers are confident they will be able to move forward next month with an unencumbered short-term spending bill and defer the health-care fight until November or December during negotiations to raise the government's borrowing limit.      Some GOP leaders fear that, because Mr. Obama won't sign any measure hampering the health law, known as the Affordable Care Act, a so-called defunding fight could lead to a government shutdown.     One GOP lawmaker who participated in the conference call said he was "stunned" by Mr. Boehner's plan. "There's no chance they have Republican votes to pass that," the lawmaker said in reference to a short-term funding extension that doesn't include a measure defunding the health law.     Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R., Kan.), a proponent of the spending-cutoff strategy, said he was disappointed. "They will have one of the most unpopular [laws] in history and they're not willing to take it on," he said. "I think the leadership is stuck in a 20th century strategy and it's 2013."     Senior House GOP aides said no final decision has been made whether to push the removal of health-care funding as part of the short-term spending bill.     According to another person on the Boehner call, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) emphasized the potential for Republicans to use the debt-ceiling talks later this fall to extract concessions from the president.      Mr. Cantor said that delaying the health-law requirement that individuals buy health insurance or pay a fine could be something that Republicans could push for in those negotiations as a condition for raising the borrowing limit, according to the person.      Republicans are also considering using the debt-limit talks to demand that Mr. Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. But Mr. Obama and Senate Democratic leaders have consistently said they won't negotiate over the debt ceiling, arguing that Congress authorized spending and must allow the Treasury to pay the bills.     Word of the emerging GOP strategy came as Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the government was "just a few weeks" away from becoming "perilously close'' to exhausting its ability to borrow. His comments Thursday marked the administration's latest attempt to persuade Congress to raise the debt ceiling in September. The $16.7 trillion borrowing limit was reached in May, but the Treasury has deployed a series of "extraordinary measures" to remain just below the cap, Mr. Lew said. Earlier this month, Treasury officials said current cash-flow projections would allow Congress to put off addressing the borrowing limit until they return after Labor Day.     The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, forecasts the government would exhaust its borrowing capacity—and be at risk of defaulting on its debts—between mid-October and mid-November.     —Eric Morath contributed to this article.
