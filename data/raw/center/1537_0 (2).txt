WASHINGTON—The wrangling between the White House and Congress over a $1.1 trillion spending bill is the first test of how political forces unleashed by the midterm elections and impending 2016 campaigns will influence governing here.The fight foreshadows two years of legislative battles defined by tensions not just between the two parties—as has been the case since the Republican takeover of the House in 2010—but within them. As Senate leaders attempted Friday to win support for quick passage of a House bill to fund most of the government through next September, they confronted the same resistance from conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats that nearly derailed the bill in the House. In the Senate, opposition could slow down the bill but isn’t expected to doom it.     Liberal Democrats say the party’s steep midterm election losses revealed a void in economic policy, which they are now moving forcefully to fill. This week, they rebelled against conservative provisions in the spending bill that President         Barack Obama    has been willing to accept.               Among Republicans, party leaders are contending with demands from the most conservative lawmakers to do more to scale back Mr. Obama’s health-care and immigration policies.        
Related Coverage        The open question is whether the newly energized ideological wings of each party will become an impediment to legislation—or whether they will be bypassed by lawmakers more open to compromise. That appeared to have happened Thursday, when 57 House Democrats joined 162 Republicans to form a fragile coalition to pass the spending bill.     For Mr. Obama, the new dynamic means he must contend not only with a more powerful Republican majority in Congress next year, but with an emboldened left wing of his own party if he tries to cut deals with Republicans and pursue an agenda at odds with that of his own supporters. He faces increasing resistance from progressive groups and liberal lawmakers in the mold of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), a White House ally whose vote against the budget agreement marked rare opposition to the president.     Those tensions are likely to come into play as Mr. Obama tries to advance portions of his agenda, such as trade deals, which could draw GOP support while losing liberal Democrats. Already, Ms. Warren and other liberal Democrats are moving to block Mr. Obama’s nomination of Lazard Ltd. banker         Antonio Weiss    to be an under secretary of the Treasury.     Mr. Obama on Friday had a sober message about the new political realities for his party, similar to one that House Speaker         John Boehner    (R., Ohio) has delivered to the right wing of his conference, which grew more forceful after the Republican takeover of the House in 2010.     “This is what is produced when you have a divided government that the American people voted for,” the president said. “Had I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly different. That is not the circumstance we find ourselves in.”     For Mr. Boehner and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), the next Senate majority leader, the challenge is to demonstrate that the new GOP majorities can net policy accomplishments with a Democratic White House while not overly frustrating conservatives’ goals.     Mr. Boehner will have a larger majority when Congress is sworn in next year, but also a conservative bloc comfortable with using confrontation to reach its policy goals. Mr. McConnell has to contend with outspoken conservatives, such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and         Rand Paul    of Kentucky, who likely will be positioning themselves for potential 2016 presidential bids.     Still, members of Congress who have lived through many lame-duck sessions—like the one that produced the $1.1 trillion government-funding bill this week—say that bill could be a model for how the parties move legislation in the next two years. They foresee legislation that falls in the sweet spot between Republicans’ desire to prove they can govern and Mr. Obama’s interest in being productive in his final years in the White House.     “President Obama is going to have to get a few more points on the board for his legacy,” said Rep. Jack Kingston (R., Ga.), who lost his bid for the Senate and is leaving Congress at the end of this year. “That could be the trans-Pacific partnership agreement; it could be a good resolution to the war with ISIS [Islamic State]. He is going to find pragmatic members of Congress who want to get things done.”              Trent Lott,    a Mississippi Republican who once served as Senate majority leader, said that the year-end drama could point to a path next year that finds more policy advanced from coalitions drawn from both parties, over the objections of liberal and conservative wings.     “I think we’re beginning to see some movement into next year that could be positive,” he said.     Some Democrats said Mr. Obama would likely work with Republicans even while drawing continued opposition from his own party. “I think you’re going to see him more engaged and probably more willing to compromise,” said former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. “This is probably the first illustration of that.”                                                 House Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and staff.          Associated Press                                                                                                             But others see next year’s Republican Congress passing legislation that would cross the bounds of what Mr. Obama could accept. “It becomes harder to pass bills that can be signed,” said         Robert Greenstein,    president of left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “The main takeaway from this is that we’re going to have really big fights next year over policy riders and funding bills.”     The latest government-funding bill produced the unusual sight of Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, saying publicly that she was disappointed in the White House. She and other liberals, including Ms. Warren, criticized a provision that would loosen a requirement in the Dodd-Frank law that banks “push out” some of their riskiest derivatives-trading activities into affiliates ineligible for federal backstop programs, such as deposit insurance.     Banks argue that the requirement actually increases risk by moving swaps activity into less-regulated entities.     Some conservatives, including Mr. Cruz and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) wanted the bill to include language aimed at blocking Mr. Obama from an executive action to shield millions of immigrants from deportation.     The pressure within each party from its most ideological wings carries implications for the 2016 presidential race.     Liberals warned that they would continue to try to push the Democratic Party to the left. “Members of Congress, candidates for Congress, candidates for president in 2016 need to recognize that the grass-roots base of this party is not on board with the Wall Street wing of this party,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, the liberal group that is trying to draft Ms. Warren to enter the presidential race.     He called for a party that is “much more aligned with the Warren wing…that fights against income inequality. That battle is going to be a pitched battle over the course of the next couple of years.”     This week’s spending debate was a reminder to GOP leaders that, even when they have a majority of the House and Senate next year, the president retains a central role in governing.     “We can get a lot done, but we’re not going to be able to defeat the president,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.), a close Boehner ally. “If you want to pass legislation, you saw the coalition last night that could do that.”     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
