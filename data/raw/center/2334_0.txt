When         Hillary Clinton    first burst onto the national political scene,         Barack Obama    was a rookie law lecturer, Bernie Sanders was an obscure back-bencher in the House of Representatives and      Donald Trump        was an over-extended developer trying to keep unhappy banks and bondholders at bay.It has been a long, quarter-century’s journey from those early days—when she famously declared that she was more than a Tammy Wynette knockoff standing by her man,         Bill Clinton    —to Tuesday night, when she celebrated becoming the first woman to accumulate the delegates needed to secure a presidential nomination. It’s an achievement that would have been impossible half a century ago, was unlikely two decades ago, and proved just beyond reach eight years ago.          By now, of course, it’s almost a cliché to say that Hillary Clinton has been preparing her whole life for this moment, but in many ways that is true. The question now is whether she has arrived at the right time—or, if not, whether she can adjust to the times at which she has arrived.     Put differently, can Mrs. Clinton now convince the country that a profile that has made her life difficult for much of this year—establishment figure, experienced in the ways of Washington, serious to the point of severity—work in her favor in the next five months? Will running against Donald Trump, a fellow baby boomer with essentially the opposite profile, make that task easier for her, or harder?                                         Hillary Clinton's stature as the first woman to be the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party was fueled in part by her embrace of gender during the 2016 campaign, something she avoided doing in 2008. She now seems focused on using her popularity among female voters as a wedge against Donald Trump in the general election.

Check. Experience in the Senate? Check. Experience in the cabinet? Check. Foreign-policy experience? Check. A raft of mainstream policy experts? Check. Book about your government record and philosophy? Check. Top-tier list of donors? Check.

But 2016 isn’t such a time, and Mrs. Clinton has had to face the reality that such a resumé, for at least some voters, isn’t an asset to be burnished but a problem to be overcome.     “I honestly believe that we are in one of the most populist eras in modern American history,” says Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic Party official and Clinton supporter who now is executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University. “The old left-right paradigm is gone, and it doesn’t exist outside of the” New York-Washington axis.                                         Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton praised Sen. Bernie Sanders' "extraordinary" campaign and addressed some his supporters' key issues during a speech on Tuesday.

Who in the hell is going to look out for me?”     What voters in 2016 are looking for, Mr. Elleithee says, is “a champion” for them.                                                                                                                                                     Sen. Bernie Sanders found that the things he had been saying to no great effect for years—Wall Street greed is ruining the economy, rich people need to pay more to help everybody else—made him into such a champion figure. Mr. Trump, despite his billions and his lavish lifestyle, found that attacking foreign trade deals and illegal immigrants has made him such a champion in the eyes of millions.     The 2016 landscape is littered with other conventional politicians who couldn’t pull that off: Jeb Bush, Scott Walker,         Chris Christie    and so on.     Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has survived, which alone is saying something this year. She’s suffered damage along the way, though. Many voters say they don’t find her honest and trustworthy, a problem exacerbated by the nagging questions over her decision to use her own email system while secretary of state. There’s an inescapable whiff of Clinton fatigue.                                                 Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton chant prior to a primary election-night rally on Tuesday in New York.

Odds are that she will find a way to do all those things.     Her problem is going to be finding a way to connect with skeptical middle Americans in revolt against the political establishment, and convince them that she can be the economic champion they seek. Mr. Elleithee says he has seen flashes of that Hillary Clinton in the primary season—but also warns she won’t be able to make that case if she allows the campaign to be an extended national conversation about Mr. Trump.
