Mr. Scully, an executive producer and political editor at C-Span, posted a tweet last week directed at former White House communications director         Anthony Scaramucci,    asking him whether he should respond to President         Trump,    who earlier had called Mr. Scully a “never Trumper” in an interview with Fox News.      In a statement released by C-Span Networks Thursday, Mr. Scully said he had received relentless criticism on social media in the weeks following his selection as the moderator of the second presidential debate, which was to take place on Oct. 15. He said the criticism culminated on Oct. 8, “when I heard President Trump go on national television twice and falsely attack me by name.”     The debate was canceled on Oct. 9 when Mr. Trump refused to agree to a virtual debate after he contracted Covid-19.               “Out of frustration, I sent a brief tweet addressed to Anthony Scaramucci,” Mr. Scully said in the statement. “The next morning when I saw that this tweet had created a new controversy, I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked. These were both errors in judgement for which I am totally responsible. I apologize.”     C-Span didn’t say how long Mr. Scully would be suspended, adding that it believed he would have the ability to contribute to the network “after some distance from this episode.”     Through a representative, Mr. Scully declined to comment. C-Span declined to comment beyond its statement.     Mr. Scully asked for forgiveness in his statement and said he was trying to move forward in a moment of “disappointment in myself.”     In lieu of a second debate between the two presidential candidates, Mr. Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President      Joe Biden,        are set to hold competing town halls on separate networks Thursday evening: Mr. Biden’s hosted by ABC News and Mr. Trump’s by NBC News. The programming plans have drawn criticism as forcing viewers to choose between the dueling events.                                         The Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the next debate would take place virtually. But President Trump said in an interview on Fox Business in early October, “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate.” Photo: Patrick Semansky/Associated Press (Originally published Oct. 8, 2020)                                                                                                     Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
