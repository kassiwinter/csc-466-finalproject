         Former New York City Mayor and possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate         Michael Bloomberg    is giving $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University. The gift is believed to be the largest ever to an academic institution.     The money is earmarked for scholarships and grants for undergraduate students from low and middle-income families, Mr. Bloomberg said through a press release. The gift will enable Johns Hopkins to become one of just a handful of need-blind schools—meaning students will be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay. Currently, 44% of Johns Hopkins students graduate with some form of debt averaging $24,000.      Mr. Bloomberg, 76 years old, said he is concerned that prestigious schools that offer elite education are too often reserved for students from wealthy families. At the nation’s most prestigious and well-resourced institutions, more students come from families in the top 1% of the income distribution than the bottom half, according to Harvard economist         Raj Chetty.         “America is at its best when we reward people based on the quality of their work, not the size of their pocketbook,” Mr. Bloomberg said.               Johns Hopkins’ endowment before the gift was $3.8 billion, according to a 2017 study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers. By comparison, Harvard University’s endowment was the largest in the country at $36 billion. The $1.8 billion gift is larger than the total endowment of all but 53 colleges and universities.     Massive, tax deductible gifts from wealthy donors to affluent schools have faced criticism for being inefficient exercises in ego gratification. The accumulated wealth of these institutions has also dented their reputations and fueled a political backlash.     Last year, President         Trump    and the Republican-led Congress passed a 1.4% annual tax on investment income earned by private-college and university endowments with at least 500 students and at least $500,000 in investments per student.     Johns Hopkins’ 2017 per-student investment was $190,592. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg said the gift wouldn’t trigger the tax at Johns Hopkins.     Last year, 35 gifts to colleges and universities exceeded $50 million, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Mr. Bloomberg’s latest gift is the largest since the Chronicle began keeping records in 1967.     Before this gift, Mr. Bloomberg had already given Johns Hopkins a total of $1.5 billion, part of his $6.4 billion in cumulative charitable giving, according to a spokesperson.     Mr. Bloomberg, a 1964 graduate from Johns Hopkins, gave $110 million to help flip the House for the Democrats in the recent mid- term elections. He has said he is considering a run for president as a Democrat in 2020.     Write to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
