President Barack Obama condemned the deadly attacks in Paris as an "attack on all of humanity."Speaking Friday evening from the White House briefing room, Obama expressed condolences and support for the French people."Once again, we've seen an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians," Obama said. "This is an attack not just on Paris, it's attack not just on the people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share."Multiple attacks across Paris, including a shooting in a restaurant, explosions near Paris' Stade de France and a hostage situation in a theater, have left at least 40 people dead and 60 wounded, according to French police. Obama said the United States is prepared to provide assistance to France, and he has been in contact with French officials. He added that he has not yet spoken directly to French President Francois Hollande."Paris itself represents the timeless values of human progress," Obama said. "Those who think they can terrorize the people of France or the values they stand for are wrong. ... The American people draw strength from the French people's commitment to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We are reminded in this time of tragedy that the bonds of liberté, égalité, fraternité are not only values that the French people care so deeply about, but are values that we share." "This is a heartbreaking situation. Those of us in the United States know what it's like," Obama added. "We've gone through these kind of episodes ourselves." Some 2016 presidential candidates, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, expressed condolences on Twitter: The reports from Paris are harrowing. Praying for the city and families of the victims. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 13, 2015
