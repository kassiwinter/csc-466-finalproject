                                                                                                                                         Sen. Bernard Sanders said Friday that Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton has taken money from the fossil fuel industry, a day after a clip of Mrs. Clinton telling an activist she’s “sick of the Sanders campaign lying” about her surfaced online.                                                                                                                                                      “Well, I’m not crazy about people disrupting meetings, but the fact of the matter is Secretary Clinton has taken significant sums of money from the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders of Vermont said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”                                                                                                                                                      In a clip posted Thursday by Greenpeace, an activist asks Mrs. Clinton if she would reject fossil fuel money in the future.                                                                                                                                                                    “I have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies,” she responded.                                                                                                                              “I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I’m sick of it,” she said, pointing her finger at the questioner.                                                                                                                                                       “She raises her money with her super PAC, she gets a lot of money from Wall Street, from the drug companies, from the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. “On the other hand, we have received over 6 million individual campaign contributions averaging $27 apiece. I’m proud of the way we are raising money.”
