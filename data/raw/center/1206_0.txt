Former senior Trump adviser         Steve Bannon    was arrested and charged with fraud Thursday in connection with an alleged scheme to siphon hundreds of thousands of dollars from a crowdfunding campaign backing one of the president’s signature promises: building a wall along the southern U.S. border.The We Build the Wall campaign raised more than $25 million, according to prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, which brought the case. The group, which isn’t connected to President Trump but was promoted by several people close to him, has spent less than half its funds on two short stretches of wall in New Mexico and Texas. “As alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,” said Acting U.S. Attorney         Audrey Strauss.         Ms. Strauss assumed leadership of the nation’s most prominent federal prosecutor’s office after Mr. Trump ousted former U.S. Attorney         Geoffrey Berman    at the request of Attorney General         William Barr    in June. A law-enforcement official said Mr. Barr was briefed on the case before Thursday’s arrests but declined to elaborate.          In addition to Mr. Bannon, the indictment charges         Brian Kolfage,         Andrew Badolato    and         Timothy Shea    with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.                                                 A section of privately built border wall in South Texas.

Appearing by videoconference wearing a white face mask and pale button-down shirt, he rocked back and forth while the judge, in a separate video screen, conducted the arraignment.     Mr. Bannon, who is due back in court on Aug. 31, was released after agreeing to a $5 million bond. He is required to follow travel restrictions including not traveling on private airplanes, yachts or boats without the judge’s permission.     Mr. Badolato, a longtime associate of Mr. Bannon’s who briefly wrote for the conservative website Breitbart News, and Mr. Kolfage, an Air Force veteran who founded We Build the Wall and ran         Facebook    pages and related sites that promoted right-wing conspiracy theories, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Shea, the host of a conservative website called Patriot Uprising, couldn’t be reached.     Thursday’s indictment marked the latest chapter in Mr. Bannon’s fall from power, after the former investment banker and media executive parlayed his understanding of conservative media into top jobs in Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and then the White House before the president removed him seven months later.     Mr. Bannon faces another probe. Federal and state authorities are investigating a media company linked to Mr. Bannon and exiled Chinese businessman         Guo Wengui    that raised more than $300 million in a private offering this spring, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.     It also emerged this week that the Senate Intelligence Committee referred Mr. Bannon last year to the Justice Department for possible prosecution, according to a person familiar with the matter, believing he had lied to congressional investigators during the panel’s yearslong probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It isn’t known whether law-enforcement officials have examined the referral.     Mr. Bannon has declined to comment on the Guo investigation. His lawyer has said he wasn’t aware of the Senate committee’s referral.     Mr. Bannon was arrested Thursday on a yacht near Connecticut belonging to Mr. Guo, who said he had allowed the former adviser to stay there to protect him from the coronavirus.     Mr. Guo, in an online broadcast, said Mr. Bannon had demanded to know why he was so cheerful Thursday. “It makes me happy to see you arrested,” Mr. Guo said he responded. Going to jail would strengthen Mr. Bannon’s resolve to fight China’s Communist Party, he said.                                                 Thursday’s indictment marked the latest chapter in Mr. Bannon’s fall from power, after he served in top Trump campaign and White House roles.

Mr. Trump on Thursday told reporters both that he didn’t know anything about the We Build the Wall campaign and that he didn’t like the project, saying he thought it was “being done for showboating reasons.” He said he hadn’t dealt with Mr. Bannon “for a very long period of time.”     Mr. Bannon has long been a forceful backer of the president’s campaign promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border “and eventually make Mexico pay for it.” In the early days of the administration, Mr. Bannon memorialized the pledge on a dry-erase board in his West Wing office. He continued pushing for a wall after leaving the White House in 2017.        
More on Steve Bannon        We Build the Wall isn’t connected to Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign or administration, though the crowdfunding effort was praised by several members of the president’s inner circle and relied on the Trump family to appear credible. The website features pictures of         Donald Trump Jr.    , one of the president’s sons, and quotes him at a 2018 event calling the group “private enterprise at its finest.”              Amanda Miller,    a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump Jr., said he gave a speech at one We Build the Wall event and “besides that, has no involvement with their organization.” She said Mr. Trump Jr. was unaware that the group had featured him as a testimonial on its website and that he hadn’t given his permission. “If he and others were deceived, the group deserves to be held accountable for their actions,” she said.     Since December 2018, prosecutors said, Messrs. Bannon, Kolfage, Badolato and Shea convinced people to donate to the We Build the Wall campaign, telling the public they do “not take a penny in salary or compensation” and that “100% of the funds raised…will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose.” They said Mr. Bannon stated publicly, “We’re a volunteer organization.”     Newsletter Sign-up News Alert Major world and business news, including political events, takeovers.      Instead, the four men received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from the organization, prosecutors said. Mr. Kolfage took more than $350,000, which he used to pay for a golf cart, a luxury SUV, cosmetic surgery and other expenses, according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon received more than $1 million, prosecutors said.     We Build the Wall has touted raising more than $25 million from 500,000 donors.     Among the early supporters was an Austin, Texas, boy named         Benton Stevens,    who raised about $22,000 by selling hot chocolate and lemonade.     His mother,         Jennifer Stevens,    said Thursday that she and her family were surprised by the news that Messrs. Kolfage and Bannon are accused of fraud. She said Benton, now 8, has visited a half-mile stretch of private border wall in New Mexico and signed his name on one of the posts.     “Whether they did or didn’t I have absolutely no idea,” Ms. Stevens said. “There were certainly no indications that there was any wrongdoing going on in the interactions that I had with them.”     That stretch of wall in Sunland Park, N.M., was the group’s first project. Built by construction firm Fisher Industries, it cost about $9 million.     Fisher Industries, a firm trying to showcase its construction to secure federal contracts, then moved on to build a $40 million private wall on the South Texas border early this year. We Build the Wall contributed less than $2 million and repeatedly claimed credit for the build.     Mr. Kolfage said in December that the group had spent at least $1 million hosting events and paying lawyers and that it had $8 million in the bank and $5 million in pledges. But the group’s claims and fundraising have drawn legal scrutiny, including an investigation in Florida, where it is registered as a nonprofit.     The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Thursday the state investigation remains active. Now that officers of the nonprofit have been charged, its charity status is immediately suspended, the agency said.     Mr. Kolfage has defended taking credit for the South Texas wall even though his organization was little involved. “We created this movement,” he said in a December interview. “It doesn’t matter how much money we put down, we’re taking ownership.”     —Sadie Gurman, Alicia A.
