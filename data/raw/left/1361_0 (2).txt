     The tweet was deleted shortly after being sent, and Perry sent out an apology. Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s Twitter account posted — and then quickly deleted — a tweet that characterized a district attorney with whom the governor is in a dispute as the “most drunk Democrat in Texas,” according to a report.  A picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, modeled after Dos Equis’ “Most Interesting Man in the World” ad campaign, was tweeted from the verified “@GovernorPerry” account on Sunday. “I don’t always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit… …but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it. I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas,” the tweet read, the Houston Chronicle reported.  The tweet was deleted shortly afterward, and Perry sent out a retraction.  ( Also on POLITICO: Perry or Cruz? DeLay won't say)  “A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized. I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down,” the followup tweet read.  Perry was indicted on Aug. 15 on two felony charges, one count of “abuse of official capacity” and another for “coercion of a public servant.” The case stems from a dispute between Perry and Lehmberg, the head of the state’s Public Integrity Unit who was arrested for drunken driving in April 2013 and sentenced to 45 days in jail. After the incident, Perry demanded that Lehmberg resign or he would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit. When she refused to resign, Perry followed through on his threat with a line-item veto.  ( Also on POLITICO: Cruz tamps shutdown chatter)  Perry’s office could not be reached for comment Monday.
