WASHINGTON—President Trump showed no sign this weekend he was prepared to give up his insistence on a border wall, as negotiators prepare to begin talks aimed at keeping the government open and resolving a bitter impasse over funding for the wall.On the day after Mr. Trump and congressional leaders reached a deal reopening the government for three weeks, Mr. Trump tweeted, “We will build the Wall!”          He also suggested underlying partisan divisions that set off the monthlong government shutdown remain in place, writing on Twitter, “both parties very dug in.”     On Sunday, his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Sunday news shows the president was willing to do “whatever it takes to secure the border,” including shut down the government once more or declare a national emergency. “The president takes this deadly seriously. It’s his No. 1 priority to secure the border,” Mr. Mulvaney told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”                Under the deal struck Friday, House and Senate negotiators appointed by congressional leadership will use the next three weeks to see if they can settle the dispute over funding for a wall along the Mexican border.     The president made the wall a central campaign promise and he insists that a physical barrier is essential to stopping illegal immigration and crimes that result from a porous border. Democrats hold that a wall is an ineffective solution and that any answer to illegal border crossings should be driven by evidence and expert evaluation.                                         President Trump announced Friday that he has agreed to a plan to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations over border funding continues. WSJ's Gerald F.

Republicans, who controlled Congress for much of his presidency, lost the House majority in the midterm elections in November. Polling shows that voters largely blamed him for a shutdown that left about 800,000 federal workers without pay. Neither party has shown much appetite for another shutdown if Mr. Trump doesn’t get the wall money he wants in the new round of negotiations.     Another option is for the president to declare a national emergency and build the wall with money that Congress hasn’t approved. But senior White House aides acknowledge that the courts would likely intervene and thwart construction while the litigation unfolds.     Still, Mr. Trump emerged from the shutdown fight with much the same message he employed throughout the standoff.     Invoking a favorite slogan, he tweeted Saturday: “BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!”          The White House strategy at this point is a continuation of an approach that aides tried in the thick of the shutdown: peel away rank-and-file Democrats from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.     Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an interview Saturday that the White House has been heartened to see some Democratic lawmakers express support for a wall.     Should negotiations break down, Mr. Gidley said: “We’ll know that and we’ll have exposed them for playing politics with people’s lives.”     White House aides have been quietly tracking statements that rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers make in local news outlets when back home in their districts. Away from the national spotlight, some Democrats have shown they are more open to a border wall than party leaders will admit, a senior White House official said.     One advantage in using a conference committee to break the stalemate is that it is a way of circumventing the Democratic leadership, White House officials said.     A congressional Democratic leadership aide on Saturday disputed that assessment. “That’s a total misread of the situation,” the aide said. Democratic House members appointed to the negotiating team support the leadership position and oppose wall funding, the aide said.     Having gotten Mr. Trump to reopen the government on their terms, Democrats said they have every incentive to hold their ground in the negotiations soon to begin.     A congressional Democratic aide said Saturday: “The whole shutdown happened because Trump insisted on something that Democrats wouldn’t go for. We’re for border security that experts say works—not the wall that the president has been asking for.”     Mr. Trump, after announcing the deal in the Rose Garden on Friday, faced a backlash from some conservatives who accused him of capitulating to Democratic leaders.     Commentator Ann Coulter called Mr. Trump “the biggest wimp ever to serve as president.”     Mr. Trump rejected the notion he made any concessions.          Another senior White House official said Saturday that Mr. Trump has hardly given up the cause. Indeed, the official said, Mr. Trump is merely granting Democrats a bit more time to strike a mutually acceptable deal.     “The president is essentially saying, ‘OK, you’ve got one more chance to come to the table and do the right thing with me here. And if you don’t do that, then I’ll take the action needed to build a barrier on the Southern border.’ ”     Asked if such action might include a national emergency declaration, the official said: “We’ll see.”     Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
