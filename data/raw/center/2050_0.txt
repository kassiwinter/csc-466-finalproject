WASHINGTON—The consecutive terror attacks that killed 224 people on a Russian charter plane Oct. 31 and well over 100 in Paris on Friday have undercut what remained of Western hopes of containing extremists, a goal sought through years of faltering wars in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya.A day before the Paris attacks, President Barack Obama sounded an optimistic note about the campaign against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria. “I don’t think they’re gaining strength,” the president told ABC News in an interview Thursday. “From the start our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them.”                                         France deployed soldiers to secure strategic areas in Paris while European leaders met to address security measures in their own countries.

Many parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East, are in a state of chaotic and deadly upheaval, with weak or nonexistent governments creating huge voids for terror networks to flourish. U.S. military planes have peppered parts of Syria and Iraq with drone strikes, killing senior Islamic State officials. Islamic State computer wizard Junaid Hussain was killed by a drone strike in Syria in August. A separate drone strike is believed to have killed a British citizen known as Jihadi John in the same city just this week.               But even after dozens of such strikes, the terror attacks continue. They have emanated from cells within Islamic State as well as terror groups stretching from North Africa, across the Middle East, to South Asia. And they often are of such scale that intelligence agencies and police forces are left dumbfounded and searching for answers.     Militants killed 17 people in France in January, most of them employees of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in a brutal slaying that raised fears about what radical Islamic militants could do after returning from war-torn areas like Yemen and Syria.                                          French President Francois Hollande said Islamic State is responsible for the six attacks in Paris on Friday night that killed at least 127 people. He described the attacks as an act of war.

In Turkey, more than 100 people were killed by twin suicide blasts Oct. 10 at a peace rally in Ankara, with Islamic State the main suspect. On Thursday, more than 40 died in a Beiruit suburb in a double suicide bombing for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.     The midair breakup of a Russian passenger jet late last month, while still under investigation, is believed to have been a rare mass casualty event caused by a bomb on a plane. And the attacks Friday night in Paris came after the country had ramped up its surveillance laws and devoted more resources to tracking citizens returning from Iraq and Syria.     The U.S. and Western countries have spent billions of dollars trying to disrupt terror networks in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya, but the war seemingly has countless fronts.     The U.S. is trying to help arm and train Sunni and Kurdish forces in areas controlled by Islamic State, with uneven success. The Kurdish Peshmerga recently retook key areas in Iraq and Syria from Islamic State militants, though U.S. officials stressed earlier Friday that terror groups still controlled large parts of both countries.

Jason Reed/Reuters1 of 17•••••     Illustrating the challenge faced by the U.S. and Western leaders, many of the large-scale terror attacks in recent years don’t have direct “command-and-control” ties to organized terror groups like al Qaeda or Islamic State. The Charlie Hebdo attackers are believed to have ties to al Qaeda leaders and training camps in Yemen, but it is unclear if the attacks were ordered by senior al Qaeda leaders.     Similarly, officials have so far not publicly linked the likely bombing of downed Russian plane, which left from the Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh, to a specific terror group, though the Sinai affiliate of Islamic State claimed responsibility.     U.S. and Western security agencies sweep up telephone and electronic records for many terror suspects in an effort to thwart future attacks and identify the location of militants. But this can be very challenging and success is uneven, particularly when attacks are carried out by so-called sleeper cells or lone-wolf actors who are harder to monitor and trace.     Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States, the U.S. vastly expanded surveillance tools, aggressively sweeping up telephone data, electronic correspondence, and even business records in an effort to anticipate future plots.                                         Friday night’s attacks in Paris confirmed what French security services have feared for months: that there would be another devastating attack like the one that left 17 dead in January. But despite boosting surveillance powers, some attackers have been able to slip through the cracks.

A Senate report last year detailed controversial and now-banned interrogation techniques that the Central Intelligence Agency had used to try to extract intelligence from suspected terrorists. Similarly, following revelations through leaked information about U.S. surveillance practices, Congress this year phased out a program that had allowed for the bulk collection of telephone records.     This further fueled the national debate about the balance between security and civil liberties in the United States, a debate that has divided leaders and the public across Europe and other parts of the globe.     But the front in efforts to corral terror networks keeps shifting. The United Nations said this year that more than 20,000 people from more than 100 countries have joined Islamic State militants to fight in Syria and Iraq. Many of these fighters have either died or stayed in the Middle East, but hundreds, perhaps more, have tried to return to their home countries in places like France, Belgium and the United Kingdom.                                         President Obama spoke to reporters after a series of assaults and explosions in Paris Friday night that police say have left dozens dead. Photo: AP                                                                                                     Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing the violence in Syria and trying to settle in parts of Europe. This has triggered a global debate about how to resettle large numbers of Muslim migrants, particularly amid fears that terrorists could try to blend in with the massive exodus.     The White House has repeatedly cautioned that the efforts to combat Islamic State, al Qaeda, and even small-scale terror networks won't be easy and could take years of fighting and setbacks.     Mr. Obama on Saturday afternoon will leave for a nine-day trip that will begin in Turkey for an annual meeting among world leaders, one that will likely now be dominated by discussions over whether a new strategy is needed to combat escalating terror attacks.     The leaders of the Group of 20 leading nations likely will issue a statement condemning these attacks and reasserting a joint commitment to combat terror groups, but the persistence and scale of these attacks will escalate pressure on each country to rethink its approach.
