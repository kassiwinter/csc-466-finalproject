Hillary Clinton expressed regret Saturday for calling half of Donald Trump's supporters "deplorables," but she stood by her sharp criticism of her Republican rival.Mrs. Clinton said she was "grossly generalistic" when she took aim at Mr. Trump's backers at a Friday fundraiser in New York, characterizing many as racist, sexist and homophobic. "That's never a good idea," she said of generalizing when describing Trump voters. "I regret saying 'half.' That was wrong."     She went on, though, to call many of Mr. Trump's actions "deplorable."          "Let's be clear: What's really ‘deplorable’ is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called ‘alt-right’ movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values" she said in the new statement after criticism mounted. "It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people."     The former secretary of state said she would not stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in the campaign, adding that she remains determined to bring people together.     After the initial remark, the Trump campaign quickly punched back, saying that Mrs. Clinton had revealed "her true contempt for everyday Americans."     "This was Clinton, as a defender of Washington’s rigged system, telling the American public that she could care less about them," said Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to Mr. Trump. "And what’s truly deplorable isn’t just that Hillary Clinton made an inexcusable mistake in front of wealthy donors and reporters happened to be around to catch it, it’s that Clinton revealed just how little she thinks of the hard-working men and women of America.”     By Saturday morning, Mr. Trump's campaign manager was urging Mrs. Clinton to make amends. Kellyanne Conway took to Twitter to denounce the comment and spar with a Clinton aide.     "Come to an event. Talk to real people who aren't donors," Ms. Conway tweeted to Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill.     "Or better: have Hillary apologize." Mr. Merrill wrote on Twitter that not all Trump voters are part of the alt-right, but alt-right leaders back the Republican nominee, and "their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events."      At her fundraiser, Mrs. Clinton later said that the other "basket" of Trump supporters are "people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they're just desperate for change."     Mrs. Clinton previously had not permitted reporters to attend her fundraisers. But this week, she has interacted more frequently with journalists, and on Friday night, she allowed a small press pool to listen to her 15-minute speech to donors. At the same event, singer Barbra Streisand mocked Mr. Trump, performing a parody of her song "Send in the Clowns." "He just shoots from the hip," Ms. Streisand sang. "He's full of bull. He's lost his grip."     Mr. Trump responded Saturday afternoon with his own counterpunch, saying Mrs. Clinton "should be ashamed of herself" and asking how the former secretary of state could be president "when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans."     "Isn't it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?" Mr. Trump said.     Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8
