                                          By Justine Coleman - 10/30/19 09:22 AM EDT                                                        A forensic pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother to look into his suicide said on Wednesday that the convicted sex offender's body showed a number of signs of homicide, contradicting a medical examiner ruling that Epstein's death was a suicide.Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has been hired Epstein’s brother to look into the matter, offered the remarks on “Fox & Friends.”“I think the evidence points to a homicide rather than a suicide,” he said.“Because there are three fractures in the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage that are very unusual for suicide and more indicative of strangulation — homicidal strangulation,” Baden added.New York City officials determined Epstein’s death was a suicide in August. He was found dead in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in the city the week prior. The financier was held at the facility beginning in July after being arrested for federal sex trafficking charges.A number of conspiracy theories have circulated following Epstein’s death, revolving around why he was not being observed while he was on suicide watch.Baden said the fact that the two guards who were supposed to check on the disgraced financier fell asleep and the security camera watching Epstein malfunctioned leads him to believe a homicide could have been possible.“I’ve never seen, in 50 years of investigating all deaths that occur in prisons in New York state, never have two guards fall asleep at the same time, while the video doesn’t work,” he said.
