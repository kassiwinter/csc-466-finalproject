         Hillary Clinton    will launch her second campaign for the White House on Sunday with much less fanfare than the standard 2016 rollout: She’ll post a video online, followed by small events with voters spaced out slowly over coming weeks.The strategy stands in contrast to Republican contenders, who have kicked off their campaigns with splashy events and cheering crowds. The lower-key approach also differs from Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential effort, when she often traveled with a large staff and Secret Service entourage that kept her at a distance from voters. Mrs. Clinton, given her long presence on the national stage and current lack of serious competition, finds herself in the odd position of appearing like an incumbent, which brings both benefits and drawbacks. While she doesn’t need to prove she can draw a crowd, Mrs. Clinton needs to show herself working hard for the nomination, her advisers say, to avoid giving the impression it is hers for the taking.        
Related        Central to the task is laying out the rationale for her campaign, which some supporters say has been absent amid Mrs. Clinton’s two-year pondering about a run.               “I think No. 1 is to articulate what she’d like to do if she were president and where she wants to take the country,” said         Jeff Link,    a Democratic consultant in Des Moines, Iowa. “We haven’t heard that.”     The answer her campaign is set to offer: Mrs. Clinton is a fighter for the middle class and a results-driven pragmatist who can make Washington work again.      In the days following her announcement, Mrs. Clinton will likely hold a handful of events followed by short bursts of travel through April. Behind the scenes, her campaign team will settle into its new headquarters in New York City, and a significant fundraising operation will gear up to begin raising more than $1 billion.     She will be accompanied by fewer aides than in 2008, in hopes of seeming more disarming and approachable, her team says.     “She needs to be a good retail politician, and go around the state and engage in meetings with voters that maybe 20 to 40 people,” said         Tom Henderson,    chairman of the Polk County Democratic Party, in Iowa’s largest county. “That’s where all the activists come. Once you start to get the activists on your side, then they will reach out to their neighbors.”     Her husband, former President         Bill Clinton,    made a similar point in an interview with Town & Country magazine.     “I think it’s important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she’s never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters,” Mr. Clinton said.     Mrs. Clinton towers over her potential rivals in polling in a way that has little precedent in recent presidential elections. On Friday, former Maryland Gov.         Martin O’Malley,    who is considering running against her for the nomination, suggested that her dominance may be overstated.      “There is an inevitable front-runner who remains inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable,” he told MSNBC.     Mrs. Clinton will make her formal launch already under fire from both the political right and left.     Republicans, presuming she is the likely general-election nominee, are attacking her on a daily basis for her decision to use a personal email account for public business as secretary of state and her family foundation’s acceptance of donations from foreign countries.      “Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary’s record proves that she cannot be trusted,”         Reince Priebus,    chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement Friday.     The RNC released an online ad with voices raising questions about her record, as a woman meant to be Mrs. Clinton walks away from the camera toward a stage. It ends with the message: “Stop Hillary.”      The RNC said it was spending more than $100,000 in online advertising including promoting the Web ad.      Some liberal Democrats worry that she isn’t populist enough in her policy outlook, especially when it comes to the economy and Wall Street, and is too willing to make compromises. Some have launched a movement to draft Sen.         Elizabeth Warren    (D., Mass.) into the race, despite her repeated statements that she won’t run.     Advisers say Mrs. Clinton’s core argument will be her support for the middle class and that she is a pragmatist who can make Washington work again. It is a case she has made in roundabout fashion in paid speeches, interviews and other appearances. In coming weeks, she will make it in town-hall meetings, diners and living rooms in states that hold early nomination contests, including Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.     During her 2008 run, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign saw her chief challenge as projecting strength, so voters would feel comfortable electing a woman as commander-in-chief at a time when the U.S. was engaged in two wars. Now, after four years as secretary of state, she has those credentials, advisers say, and the goal is to show a softer side.     In a new epilogue being published with the paperback release of her most recent book, “Hard Choices,” Mrs. Clinton writes of the joys of becoming a grandmother. She segues from her personal experience to her policy agenda—something advisers say she will do frequently.     “You shouldn’t have to be the granddaughter of a President or a Secretary of State to receive excellent health care, education, enrichment, and all the support and advantages that will one day lead to a good job and a successful life,” she wrote in an excerpt published in the Huffington Post.     Mrs. Clinton is expected to frame the economic debate around the idea of “responsible capitalism,” said one adviser. “You can support business, but business needs to be responsible in how they make money and what they need to give back to society,” is how the adviser put it.     She will also draw distinctions with Mr. Obama, emphasizing how she would give high priority to forging close ties to Capitol Hill, something many say Mr. Obama failed to do. In one speech last year, she seemed to offer a veiled criticism of the president.     “I mean, some people can paint a beautiful vision,” she said at a CNN event. “And, thankfully, we can all learn from that. But then, can you, with the tenacity, the persistence, the getting-knocked down, getting-back-up resilience, can you lead us there?
