The Trump administration moved Friday toward its goal of maximum economic pressure against Iran, while granting waivers allowing eight countries to temporarily import Iranian oil without facing U.S. punishment.The waivers, to countries that government advisers say include China, Turkey and India, are designed to give them time to switch to other suppliers while sharply reducing or eliminating their purchases of Iranian oil over time. But with the U.S. economic pressure campaign coming into full force at 12:01 a.m. eastern time Monday, American officials also struggled to plug the holes that have plagued past sanctions plans against Iran.     Unlike the global support for the Obama administration’s penalties, broad opposition to the current U.S. policy, including from European allies, is sure to complicate the task. And Iran has pledged to resist the sanctions.               Still, the Trump administration is off to a strong start: Iranian oil exports have fallen by more than a million barrels a day since the White House launched its new campaign in May. That decline represents more than a third of international sales.         Related        Iran's economy, with oil accounting for 80% of tax revenue, is in pain. Europe’s largest companies have pulled out, and Iranian consumers rushed to exchange their rials, pushing the currency’s value to record lows and sparking a surge in consumer prices.     In March, the International Monetary Fund forecast Iran’s economy would expand by 4% in 2018. Now it predicts a two-year recession, with a 3.6% contraction next year.                                         The price of a tank of gas has been rising, and coming U.S. sanctions on Iran mean drivers could be in for even more pain at the pump. But that’s not the whole story.

The Trump administration’s strategy to harden sanctions began with its decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear pact, which triggered the reimposition of many sanctions while giving the U.S. leeway on how leniently or forcefully to apply economic pressure. An executive order issued by President Trump set Nov. 5 as the day the oil sanctions resume.      They prohibit purchases of Iranian oil, with companies facing sanctions unless the State Department grants waivers to their home countries.      U.S. officials didn’t name the countries receiving waivers on Friday. The government advisers said China, India and Turkey along with South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Iraq are likely to receive waivers.     Separately on Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department said it lifted sanctions on two Turkish government ministers that were imposed in August amid Ankara’s refusal at the time to free         Pastor Andrew Brunson,    who was arrested three months after a failed July 2016 military coup. Turkey has since released him.     Treasury Secretary         Steven Mnuchin    told reporters Friday that his office will add more than 700 Iranian banks, companies and individuals to its sanctions blacklist, including some that previously had been granted sanctions relief under the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.      Some of the Iranian banks will be blacklisted for their ties to the government, while others will be targeted for financing activities linked to U.S.-designated terror groups, human rights abuses and weapons programs.     The U.S. warned that the Europe-based financial messaging firm Swift, whose infrastructure allows banks to quickly and cheaply conduct cross-border transactions, also risks U.S. penalties if it doesn’t disconnect banks tied to terror groups, rights abuses and weapons programs from its system.     That threat has fueled tensions with Washington’s trans-Atlantic allies who have so far opposed the Trump administration’s Iran policy.     Swift declined to comment.      The Trump administration is seeking to surpass the success of the Obama sanctions, which led to the 2015 nuclear deal. After exiting from that deal in May, the Trump team said it wants a more comprehensive accord with Iran that not only prevents development of nuclear weapons, but also bans long-range missiles and curbs Tehran’s support for armed conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.     “History shows that this regime only changes its behavior and comes to the negotiating table when under significant pressure,” Mr. Hook said.     But Tehran isn’t completely isolated. Many of the world’s largest economies, including trans-Atlantic allies, opposed the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the nuclear accord and reimpose sanctions. European governments and others have sought to preserve ties with Iran, in part an effort to ensure it stays in the nuclear accord. That global support for Tehran may give license to evasion.     “The dissatisfaction with the U.S. sanctions program is a silent encouragement for circumvention,” said         Alma Angotti,    managing director of Navigant Consulting’s global investigations practice.     The European Union, despite a corporate exodus, wants to shield trade and finance with Iran from U.S. sanctions. Firms from China, Russia and elsewhere have remained in Iran.                                         A combination of machine learning, big data and tens of millions of satellite images of the planet each day is bad news for carriers of Iranian crude oil trying to evade U.S. oil sanctions. Here’s why.                                                                                                     Washington said it is aiming to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero over the coming months, threatening sanctions against companies and countries that don’t switch to the new sources the U.S. is negotiating to bring online in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar and at home.     As its aboveboard oil sales decline, Iran’s government is scrambling to keep selling surreptitiously, using techniques honed during the Obama pressure campaign, U.S. officials say: loading cargoes into non-Iranian vessels at sea, and turning off shipboard satellite beacons.     In recent months, Tehran has assembled a special sanctions-busting group, Iran experts say, with top officials from the oil, intelligence, export and foreign ministries and the Central Bank of Iran.     During the Obama-era pressure campaign, Tehran moved tens of billions of dollars-worth of oil, gold and other goods through banks, trading companies and exchange houses across the globe, including in Turkey and Dubai, one of the seven U.A.E. emirates. It is reactivating that infrastructure, U.S. officials say.     Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank—as well as several other Turkish banks under scrutiny by U.S. prosecutors—is facing potential multibillion-dollar fines by the U.S. for its role in those activities.     Neither the bank nor officials at the Turkish and U.A.E. embassies in Washington responded to requests for comment.     A U.S. security official familiar with the matter said the Dubai government has reassured the U.S. that it won’t allow such activity again.     “There’s nothing right now that gives me a specific concern that there will be real leakage,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said between stops on a Middle East tour last month.     Much of his trip—which included stops in the U.A.E., Qatar and Kuwait—centered on securing sanctions enforcement. But, “to the extent that we see it, we will figure out to plug the holes,” Mr. Mnuchin said.     Mr. Hook said the U.S. already knows Iran’s clandestine channels and will be “vigorous and relentless in enforcement.”     The European Union’s foreign policy chief and the French, British and German foreign and finance ministers said in a statement that the European governments “deeply regret the further re-imposition of sanctions” and reiterated their support for the 2015 nuclear deal.     The officials said they are still working on measures to protect trade and investment in Iran but that the centerpiece of these measures -- a special purpose vehicle to facilitate commerce - was not yet ready.     —Asa Fitch in Dubai and Laurence Norman in Brussels contributed to this article.
