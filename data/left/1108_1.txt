 
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee continues to defend the NSA bulk data collection program in the wake of the release of a report commissioned by the White House that called for a number of changes.
Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said Sunday on ABC's "This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that the report had a number of high points, including saying that the recommendations make the case that program is legal and didn't violate constitutional rights. But he disagreed with a recommendation that the data be held by private companies than the government.
"I think it opens it up to more privacy violations when the company holds it," Rogers said. "These are business records, not private records of content, so they’re not listening to phone calls."
Rogers also said former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who made the NSA collection program public, should return to the United States to face charges for the leaks.
"I do think he should come home — I would personally pay for his plane ticket — and be held accountable for his actions," Rogers said. "He has contacted a foreign country and said I would sell you classified information for something of value."
He added, referring to an open letter Snowden sent Brazil, "We call that treason, and I think that letter very clearly lays out who this gentleman is and what his intentions are clearly."
