The number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims continued to fall last week to 473,000, a drop of 34,000 from the prior week's revised level, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.The number was below expectations of 500,000. The continued downward trend brings the number to its lowest level since March 14, 2020, when it stood at 256,000. The previous week's level was revised up by 9,000 from 498,000 to 507,000. The four-week moving average was 534,000, a decrease of 28,250 from the previous week's revised average. That is also the lowest level since March 14, 2020, when it was 225,500. Economists and Wall Street were closely watching the number after last week's disappointing monthly jobs report for April. Instead of the 1 million new jobs that had been forecast, the number came in at a paltry 266,000.The Week in Cartoons: May 10-14That raised alarms that the steady improvement in the labor market had hit a speed bump.Some suggested would-be workers were disincentivized to work, given the $300-a-week enhanced unemployment benefit that was part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress in March. Meanwhile, companies across a wide swath of industries report difficulty filling job openings.Overall, the economy is performing strongly with some forecasting gross domestic product growth this year of 7%, which would be the best in decades. However, the April jobs report has called that narrative into question and Wednesday's news that inflation surged in April to an annual rate of 4.2% did not help. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 682 points.Already, a partisan debate is unfolding over whether too much government stimulus spending could lead to an inflation-induced economic or market downturn. "Is this inflation spike transitory, or is it on a sustained trajectory?" asked David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, in a note to clients Thursday. "Is it a monetary-induced inflation or a shock response? How do we know? And when will the answers become clear?""The answer, for now, is that we don't know when, and we don't have the metrics to prescribe shock response policymaking," Kotok wrote Thursday. "The Fed doesn't have those metrics either."
