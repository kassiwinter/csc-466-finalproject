WASHINGTON—President         Barack Obama    faces pressure at home and in the Middle East to quickly step up strikes at Islamic State militants, but also reluctance from some within his own party and European allies to do so.The leading options under consideration for strikes in Syria—if Mr. Obama decides to expand the fight—are narrow in scope, designed to prevent the Islamic State from carrying out any plots that threaten Americans and from resupplying its forces in neighboring Iraq. Officials played down prospects for a broad-based campaign to uproot and destroy Islamic State's vast fighting force in Syria. Republicans seized on Islamic State's battlefield gains in Syria and the beheading of a U.S. journalist last week to step up calls for a more aggressive stance. As the U.S. military said Sunday it carried out two more air strikes in Iraq, Republicans urged more decisive military action to include airstrikes in Syria.           
Related           All options must be on the table for defeating Islamic State, including deploying U.S. ground troops in Syria if military commanders decide they are needed, said Republican Sen.         Lindsey Graham    of South Carolina on CNN's "State of the Union." "We've got to win and stop these guys," he said.                But Mr. Obama, who has ruled out putting "boots on the ground" in a combat role in Iraq or Syria, remains reluctant to get too deeply involved in a conflict that top advisers say could become a quagmire—a sentiment shared by some of his fellow Democrats in Congress.      Rep.         Adam Schiff,    a California Democrat and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, agreed with his Republican counterparts that the Islamic State was "probably the most prominent risk that we have faced since 9/11," but he voiced doubt that Mr. Obama would authorize airstrikes in Syria against the group.     "I think he's going to hear out the military commanders and what their recommendations or options are. But we don't have the same capabilities on the ground in Syria that we do in Iraq," Mr. Schiff told NBC's "Today." "And so airstrikes alone, without coordination on the ground, would be very limited in effect. And I think the president is unlikely to go there in the near term."     Defense officials said any strikes in Syria, at least initially, would be so limited that ground forces may not be essential. U.S. officials are concerned that any attacks that push Islamic State fighters out of one area would open the door for Assad regime forces to move back in, rather than benefit the moderate rebel forces.     But officials said those concerns must be measured against Islamic State's continuing consolidation of its power in Syria, most dramatically in its taking of the Tabqa air base Sunday after five days of fighting.      The White House has put a premium on trying to build an international coalition to counter Islamic State, but comments Sunday by Britain's ambassador to the U.S., cast doubt on the willingness of America's most reliable European ally to play a direct military role in striking Islamist targets alongside the U.S.      Ambassador Peter Westmacott said Sunday that while the U.K. supported a "joint operation" against Islamic State and was exploring ways to help, it wasn't "contemplating a direct military action at this point." He also voiced caution about providing lethal weapons to moderate fighters in Syria, citing the Islamic State's ability to seize large amounts of American equipment in Iraq.     Mr. Obama has long resisted international pressure to intervene in Syria's civil war, but top Pentagon and White House national security officials have in recent days raised the prospect that the president could expand strikes from Iraq to Syria to weaken the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Defense Secretary         Chuck Hagel    has said all options were on the table, and U.S. officials have said the U.S. military is collecting intelligence on potential targets such as training camps inside Syria.                                                                                                                                                     House Intelligence Committee Chairman         Mike Rogers    (R., Mich.) said Sunday that the U.S. is directly threatened by foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.      "They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores, and that's why we're so concerned about it," Mr. Rogers told NBC's "Meet the Press," citing intelligence that more than 2,000 Islamic State fighters carry Western passports that could give them easy access to Europe and the U.S.      The president last week labeled Islamic State militants a "cancer" in the region and called for an international campaign to defeat extremist forces, suggesting he could soon authorize strikes. Deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said that if Islamic State fighters threaten Americans, "we're going to come after you wherever you are."     A senior administration official said Sunday that the White House has been in close consultation with Congress about the threat posed by Islamic State militants and would continue to provide reports to Congress consistent with the requirement laid out in the War Powers resolution.     —Victoria McGrane       contributed to this article.
