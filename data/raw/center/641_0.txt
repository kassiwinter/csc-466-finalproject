Officials previously had to wait 48 hours before an asylum-seeker’s interview and hearing, but Cuccinelli sped up the process to be one day.His policy required immigrants to prove they would face persecution if they returned to their home countries.Cuccinelli became the deputy secretary of the department in November but is still named as the senior official who runs USCIS.
