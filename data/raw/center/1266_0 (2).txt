Tuesday brings the biggest primary day of the season. Republicans will pick Senate candidates in Georgia, Kentucky and Oregon. Pennsylvania Democrats will choose their candidate to face Gov. Tom Corbett. And there are an array of open House races in Georgia. (Related: Election Drama in House Primaries Tuesday)Kentucky GOP Senate primary Polls open (ET): 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the Central Time Zone     Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to win big over challenger Matt Bevin, but there may be clues in Tuesday's results that tell us something about Mr. McConnell's general election battle with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.          As our Dante Chinni points out, if Mr. McConnell puts up big margins in evangelical areas in the primary, it bodes well for him in the general election, when Ms. Grimes may do better in Kentucky's population centers than did Mr. McConnell's underfunded 2008 challenger, Bruce Lunsford.                                                                                                                                                     For Mr. Bevin, Tuesday ends what has been a disappointing effort to oust Mr. McConnell from the right. He poured $900,000 of his own money into the campaign but never gained traction. From making rookie mistakes like allowing himself to debate a McConnell aide to having backed the Troubled Asset Relief Program he attacked Mr. McConnell for supporting to speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally and then having to apologize for it, it has been a parade of errors for Mr. Bevin.     Meanwhile, Mr. McConnell has had support from the broad Republican establishment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association have spent money on his behalf, while Mr. McConnell's chief antagonists, the Senate Conservatives Fund, has backed Mr. Bevin.     Mr. Bevin's race marks the beginning of what is setting up to be a string of defeats for Republican challengers to incumbent senators. Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel trails Sen. Thad Cochran and over the weekend was forced to explain why a supporter videotaped Mr. Cochran's ailing wife at her nursing home. In Kansas, physician Milton Wolf hasn't gained traction against Sen. Pat Roberts after admitting that he wrote Facebook comments about patients he treated.     Georgia GOP Senate Primary Polls open (ET): 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.     This is a three-way race to finish second. Former Reebok and Dollar General CEO David Perdue, Rep. Jack Kingston and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel are atop a five-way field to replace Sen. Saxby Chambliss.     Since state law requires a July run-off election if no candidate reaches 50% in the primary – a certainty in a five-way race – the drama here is who will finish second, Mr. Kingston or Ms. Handel. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is advertising in heavy rotation to back Mr. Kingston, while Ms. Handel has support from Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum.                                                                                                                                                     Democrats had hoped – and Republican establishment types feared – that one of the two tea-party physicians in the race, Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, would advance out of the primary, but odds of that now appear slim. Whichever Republican survives will face Democrat Michelle Nunn in November.     If Ms. Handel qualifies for the run-off, the contours of the run-off will be clear: She will assume most tea party support while Mr. Kingston, a 22-year House veteran, or Mr. Perdue, whose cousin Sonny Perdue was governor, would be the establishment's choice. In past years the establishment has lost those intraparty battles. This year the tables have turned.     Oregon GOP Senate Primary Polls open (ET): 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.     Monica Wehby is the longshot hope for Senate Republicans in 2014. A pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Wehby raised an impressive amount of money for a first-time candidate, released a set of sharp TV ads and has positioned herself as a moderate in a blue state. Now she only needs to defeat a more conservative primary opponent, state Rep. Jason Conger.                                                                                                                                                     And then came the allegations she stalked an ex-boyfriend, who happens to now be a prominent campaign supporter.     The stalking allegations may have more impact on Dr. Wehby's general election chances than during the primary – most Oregonians vote by mail – but she has not handled the questions with much deft, fleeing a Friday debate "as reporters tried without success to interview her," Portland's Oregonian wrote.     Mr. Conger is to the right of Dr. Wehby on a host of social issues important to Republicans (gay marriage and abortion rights in particular). But with Dr. Wehby holding double-digit leads in pre-primary polling, the last-minute hit may not be damaging enough to her Tuesday. But the next five months may tell a different story.     Idaho GOP 2 Congressional District primary Polls open (ET): 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.     Rep. Mike Simpson is one of House Speaker John Boehner's key allies and a top target for the Club for Growth. But after $500,000 in advertising tying Mr. Simpson to the TARP bailout and other conservative apostasies failing to close the gap, the Club for Growth bailed on the race. It hasn't advertised in Idaho in the campaign's final weeks, when it shifted its resources to Nebraska's Senate primary.                                                                                                                                                     Attorney Bryan Smith was left to fend for himself, while Mr. Simpson had an array of mainstream Republican defenders at the ready: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Defending Main Street super PAC, the National Rifle Association, the National Association of Realtors and the American Dental Association all spent on Mr. Simpson's behalf. Mitt Romney, who won 65% of Idaho's 2012 vote, filmed an ad backing Mr. Simpson.     In the end it was too much for Mr. Smith, who has local tea party support but little other help on the TV airwaves. Mr. Simpson is expected to cruise to re-election in November. (Related: Election Drama in House Primaries Tuesday)     Pennsylvania Governor Polls open (ET): 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.     After spending $10 million on his race, Tom Wolf carries a wide lead over the three other Democrats fighting for the right to face Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in November.     There are few policy differences between Mr. Wolf, whose family owns a cabinetry company, Rep. Allyson Schwartz, who represents a Philadelphia-area district, former Clinton administration adviser Katie McGinty, or state Treasurer Rob McCord.     Ms. Schwartz, in a rare tactic for Democrats this cycle, has gone out of her way to highlight her support for Obamacare. That's key in a state where Mr. Corbett declined to accept the Medicaid expansion and is seen as one of the nation's most vulnerable incumbent governors. But it is likely not enough to overcome months of Mr. Wolf's television advertising.     Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.
