The U.S. has ordered the evacuation of another consulate overseas in response to a terrorist threat, CNN reported. According to The Associated Press, the State Department issued the "ordered departure" for all of its diplomats in Lahore, Pakistan, on Thursday after receiving a threat specific to the site's mission. The exact nature of the threat was not released.Diplomats will be moved to Islamabad, and only a handful of emergency personnel will be allowed to remain in Lahore.The State Department also issued a travel warning, urging all U.S. citizens against travel to Pakistan."The presence of several foreign and indigenous terrorist groups poses a potential danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan," the travel warning said.Those who choose to remain in Pakistan are advised to pay attention to their surroundings, bypass hotels that lack stringent security measures, avoid locations where Westerners are known to congregate and steer clear of crowds."Protests against the United States are not uncommon and have the potential to turn violent. U.S. citizens in Pakistan are strongly advised to avoid all protests and large gatherings," the warning stated.A previous travel warning from September 2012 reminded Americans to be aware of "ongoing security concerns in Pakistan" and urged U.S. citizens to defer all non-essential travel to the country.Earlier this week, the State Dept. ordered the evacuation of all non-essential government personnel at the U.S. embassy in Sanaa, Yemen. A travel warning also urged all Americans to leave the country, as there would be no support available to them.A threat by al Qaeda triggered the temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Middle East and Africa last week.
