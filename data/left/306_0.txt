impeachment is an open doorImpeachment is getting up close and personal.The House Intelligence Committee will hold its first public impeachment hearings next week, committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced Wednesday. Former top Ukraine diplomat William Taylor and current Europe adviser George Kent will testify Wednesday, Nov. 13, and ex-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday, Nov. 15.Taylor reportedly provided some of the most damning testimony against President Trump in his closed-door impeachment hearing last month, describing a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine. Yovanovitch meanwhile used her closed-door testimony to detail how Trump pushed her out based on Rudy Giuliani's "unfounded and false claims," and how she felt threatened by Trump at times.A transcript of Yovanovitch's earlier testimony was released Monday, and Taylor's transcript is set to be released Wednesday, Schiff also said.
