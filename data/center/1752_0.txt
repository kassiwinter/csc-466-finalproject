President         Biden    wants to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Democratic allies in Congress released new details Tuesday on legislation to lift the wage floor in phases over four years. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a patchwork of states increasing the wage floor above that minimum.What is being proposed? Mr. Biden in two recent speeches called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, which requires action by Congress. A bill introduced by Democrats this week would increase the wage floor to $15 an hour four years after the new law’s effective date. The first increase to $9.50 an hour would occur the day a law becomes effective. Annual increases would follow until reaching $15 an hour, then the rate would be reviewed annually and adjusted based on changes to median hourly earnings of all employees.

That minimum wage for adult workers is currently $2.13 an hour. The bill also eliminates separate subminimum wages for youth and disabled workers.          Why do Democrats want to raise the minimum wage? Democrats say raising the minimum wage will help lift the lowest-wage workers out of poverty and give them more spending power. The proposal matches a level long backed by labor unions.     Many low-wage workers, such as those working in retail or hospitality jobs, often qualify for government assistance despite having a job.     “No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line,” Mr. Biden said last week.     Working full time at $7.25 an hour, a worker would earn about $15,000 annually. With one dependent, the worker would live below the federal poverty line. At $15 an hour, a family of four would be slightly above the poverty line, according to the government guidelines.     What are Republicans saying? Republicans have raised concerns that $15 an hour is too high in rural areas and regions of the country with a lower cost of living. They say a wage floor at that level could result in businesses forgoing hiring or cutting workers’ hours.     “If the federal government mandates a universal $15 minimum wage, many low-income Americans will lose their current jobs and find fewer job opportunities in the future,” Sen.         Pat Toomey    (R., Pa.), said earlier this month. Pennsylvania is one of 21 states that follow the federal minimum wage.     What are businesses saying? Several large employers have raised their starting wages in recent years, and some have suggested a federal increase could help level the playing field among businesses.              Walmart Inc.,    the nation’s largest private employer, starts workers at $11 an hour. Chief Executive         Doug McMillion    has said $7.25 an hour is too low but indicated that $15 is too high.         Target Corp.    and         Costco Wholesale Corp.    have raised their starting wages to $15 an hour.         Starbucks Corp.    in December said all of its U.S. workers would earn $15 or above in the next two to three years.              Glenn Spencer,    the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s senior vice president on employment policy, said the business lobbying group is open to an increase. But the group, which represents small and large businesses nationwide, said $15 an hour would be too high and would negatively affect employment at restaurants and stores, sectors that lost the most jobs last year.     “A minimum-wage increase ought to be on the table, but $15 is a problematic number,” he said. “It’s a figure based in politics and not economics.”     What do economists think? Economists are split on whether minimum-wage increases cost workers jobs. Basic economic theory says that when prices increase—wages in the case of labor—demand for that product falls, meaning fewer workers are hired or hours are cut.     Some economists found that higher minimum wages cause employers to automate low-wage jobs. Others studied 138 state-level minimum-wage increases and found low-wage unemployment was unchanged in the five years following the increases.     The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in 2019, found that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would cost 1.3 million workers their jobs, while lifting the same number out of poverty. That report found the increase would boost the wages of 17 million workers who would otherwise earn less than $15 an hour and another 10 million workers otherwise earning slightly more than $15 an hour.     Do all states follow the federal minimum wage? No. The federal minimum wage is currently enforced in 21 states that either don’t have a state minimum wage or set a level at or below $7.25 an hour. Those states include Georgia, Texas and Virginia. Many more states would follow the federal rate if it were increased to $15 an hour.     Newsletter Sign-up Politics Alert Major political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.      Most states have set a minimum wage higher than $7.25 an hour, including a $13.69-an-hour rate in Washington state. Other states have higher rates based on size of employer and location in the state. Eight states, most recently Florida, have approved an eventual $15-an-hour minimum wage.     Several cities have higher minimum wages, including Seattle ($16.69 an hour for large employers), San Francisco ($16.07 an hour), New York City ($15 an hour) and Washington, D.C. ($15 an hour).     Who earns the federal minimum wage? The federal minimum wage is disproportionately paid to younger people, Black workers and women. According to the Labor Department, 58.5% of minimum-wage workers were 24 years old or younger in 2019, the latest available data. Those workers account for about 20% of workers paid hourly wages.     Women accounted for 68.2% of minimum-wage workers in 2019. Just over a quarter of minimum-wage employees are Black workers, nearly double their share of the overall population. Almost 75% of minimum-wage workers held part-time jobs.                                         President Biden on Friday signed two executive orders aimed at boosting pandemic aid, including increasing food assistance and enhancing worker protections.

Corrections & Amplifications   A minimum wage bill introduced by Democrats would increase the wage floor to $15 an hour four years after the law’s effective date. Separately, Washington state has a $13.69 an hour minimum wage and other states have higher wage floors based on the number employed by the business and location in a state. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the increase in the wage floor would be phased in over five years and that Massachusetts had the highest minimum wage in the country at $13.50 an hour.
