    Video: Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib discusses the significance of President Barack Obama's budget proposal.     President Barack Obama's budget for next year, released Monday, is filled with ideas, programs and proposals with prospects for adoption by the new Republican-controlled Congress that range from dismal to zero.     Then there is corporate tax reform.      It may seem illogical to direct hopes for agreement toward one of the most far-reaching and politically fraught proposals on the president's wish list, but, in fact, there are two big forces that can pry open the door to at least a serious bipartisan discussion on corporate tax reform this year. The first is inversions and the second is infrastructure.          But first, let's recap what the president has proposed. He is suggesting a revamp of the tax code that would lower the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 35%; establish a special 25% rate for manufacturing businesses; impose a 19% tax on overseas earnings of American corporations; and, in a new and controversial initiative, impose a 14% tax on earnings American corporations have accumulated and left parked overseas.     That one-time tax on companies' accumulated earnings would generate $268 billion over the next decade, the administration estimates. And that would go a long way to pay for one of the president's other big initiatives, a program to rebuild chunks of America's aged infrastructure.     Mr. Obama is calling for a six-year, $478 billion plan to rebuild, repair and upgrade the nation's roads and bridges, as well as finance new mass-transit projects and rail improvements that the White House says will be important to businesses. That's a considerable step up from the $302 billion the administration sought last year—a sign of the political momentum that's building behind doing more to fix the nation's infrastructure.     Most people in both parties believe that corporate tax code needs a basic rewrite. But that's been the case for a while now. Why believe that the president's proposal this week represents a better start than proposals that have come before—particularly when he's seeking higher tax levels than Republicans want?                                                 Burger King Worldwide agreed to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. for in a deal that moves its headquarters to Canada.

A spate of inversions by American companies—through which corporate headquarters are relocated overseas to a country that's more tax-friendly—has served as a bracing reminder to all sides that the current corporate tax code simply isn't competitive internationally and that there are real consequences because of that. When a wave of inversions by American drug companies as well as proposed or completed inversions by companies with such iconic brands as Burger King and         Walgreens    materialize as they did last year, both voters and politicians pay attention.     At the same time, fixing infrastructure has been climbing slowly and steadily up the to-do list of both parties. It helps that infrastructure spending is popular with business interests and scores well back home for politicians of both parties. So, when it comes to launching a serious debate on tax reform, "infrastructure can help bring it together," says one senior administration official.        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
