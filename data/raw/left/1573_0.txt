The Cal State East Bay student and Chinese national hobnobbed with some of the Bay Area’s leading politicians, even fundraising for some. She attended student events, fundraisers, campaign rallies and cocktail parties throughout the region, ingratiating herself to politicians on the rise.But what Congressman Eric Swalwell and others didn’t know was Christine Fang, or Fang Fang, was a suspected Chinese spy, according to a one-year investigation by Axios. U.S. intelligence officials told the news organization that China’s main civilian spy agency ran an operation developing connections with local and national politicians — with particular focus on the Bay Area — between 2011 and 2015. The idea, they said, was to use Fang to develop links with politicians who were destined for bigger, national roles especially in the influential Northern California region with ties to Silicon Valley.       But those Bay Area officials who rubbed shoulders with her told The Chronicle they had only vague memories of the woman in her 20s or 30s who simply stopped showing up to events about five years ago.         “She had a nice car and everyone wondered how in the hell she got that as a college student,” said Bill Harrison, former Fremont mayor. “Otherwise, she was smart and kind of knew the government structure.”         Fang volunteered in Harrison’s office and helped coordinate talks about creating a sister city in China with Fremont, the former mayor said. Otherwise, he knew her as a student dedicated to her activities with Chinese student organizations. She suddenly disappeared in 2015 and that August, Harrison said the FBI called his City Hall office and asked to talk.         “They were suspicious of her connection to the Chinese government,” Harrison recalled.            He remembered leaving the meeting and asking himself: “Why the heck does the Chinese government care about the mayor of Fremont?”         The efforts were to try and sow seeds that might take years to bear fruit, Axios reported. While U.S. officials don’t believe Fang obtained or passed on classified information, the case “was a big deal, because there were some really, really sensitive people that were caught up,” in the intelligence network, a current senior U.S. intelligence official told the news organization.              One such individual was Swalwell, who Fang started targeting when he was still a Dublin city councilman, according to Axios.         The news agency said she helped raise funds for his 2014 re-election campaign, although she did not make a donation herself. She also placed at least one intern in the congressman’s office and interacted with Swalwell at multiple events. The FBI also approached the congressman in 2015 about their concerns and he immediately cut off ties to Fang, Axios reported.         “Swalwell was completely cooperative and under no suspicion of wrongdoing,” an FBI official familiar with the investigation said, speaking to The Chronicle anonymously as the agent was not authorized to speak to the media. “It was a defensive briefing. Information was obtained where we do a duty to warn ... that he may be targeted by a foreign government.”         Swalwell’s office declined to comment Tuesday other than providing a brief statement.         “Rep. Swalwell, long ago, provided information about this person — whom he met more than eight years ago, and whom he hasn’t seen in nearly six years — to the FBI,” the statement read. “To protect information that might be classified, he will not participate in your story.”            Fang had a who’s who of Facebook friends from the Bay Area political scene, including Congressman Ro Khanna, Axios reported. The organization reported that she volunteered for Khanna’s unsuccessful 2014 House run and attended several political gatherings.         Khanna told The Chronicle he had more than 500 student volunteers and he had no memories of her.         “She may have shown up at some event but played no meaningful role and no one on the campaign remembers her,” he said.         In the Axios article, Fang is shown in a photograph next to State Assemblyman Ash Kalra in 2014. However, the San Jose legislator’s office said neither Kalra nor his staff know Fang and the photograph was taken at a Sister Cities International conference in Washington, D.C., an event attended by hundreds of people across the country. Kalra was on the national board at the time and does not recall ever having a conversation with Fang, his spokeswoman Roseryn Bhudsabourg said.         Fang did not return multiple requests for comment from Axios.         Matthias Gafni is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: matthias.gafni@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @mgafni
