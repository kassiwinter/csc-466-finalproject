WASHINGTON—GOP state Rep.         Jake Ellzey    won a special election runoff in Texas on Tuesday, unexpectedly defeating the widow of the GOP lawmaker he will replace in the U.S. House, according to the Associated Press.Republican         Susan Wright    had been favored to win the runoff after being endorsed by former President      Donald Trump        to represent the district south of Dallas. Her late husband, Ron Wright, died in February at the start of his second House term after battling Covid-19 and cancer. Mr. Ellzey’s victory was seen as a repudiation of the power of Mr. Trump’s endorsement in a runoff race between two GOP candidates. However, political analysts noted that Democrats and Republicans opposed to Mr. Trump were likely at least partially responsible for boosting Mr. Ellzey in reaction to the former president’s backing of Mrs. Wright.     “It’s not the cleanest test of a Trump endorsement in a GOP primary because while both candidates were Republicans, the special election was open” to independents and Democrats, Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst at the nonpartisan Inside Elections, said on Twitter Tuesday night. “But it’s a reminder that Trump’s endorsement isn’t always a ticket to DC.”     Newsletter Sign-up Capital Journal Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.      Turnout in the runoff was low, according to the Cook Political Report.           Mrs. Wright finished first among 23 candidates in the May 1 special election, with just over 19% of the vote, topping Mr. Ellzey’s roughly 14% share, according to the Texas Secretary of State. Mr. Trump endorsed Mrs. Wright in late April and reiterated his support for her at a virtual tele-rally Monday night.     “She has my complete and total endorsement,” Mr. Trump said Monday night, praising her late husband as well. “Susan will carry on his legacy and stand up to the radical left and fight for our America First agenda.”     On Tuesday night Mrs. Wright missed out on becoming the second Covid widow elected this year. In March, Rep. Julia Letlow (R., La.) won a special election to fill the seat vacated when her husband, Luke, died in late December just days before he was set to be sworn in for his first term.     Mrs. Wright had a political career separate from that of her husband’s, whom she met in June 2000 at the Texas GOP convention in Houston. A former training director for airlines, she also served as a district director for two members of the Texas state House and as committeewoman for the state Republican Executive Committee.

He is currently serving his first term in the state House.     With low turnout anticipated for the special election runoff, Mr. Trump’s endorsement was expected to carry weight with the motivated crowd that did vote, according to GOP lawmakers and operatives.     “It’s quite significant,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who backed Mrs. Wright. “The voters of Texas support President Trump and his support of Susan Wright is indicative of the fact that she is the strongest conservative in the race.”     Other Republicans rebutted the idea that Mr. Trump’s endorsement defined Mrs. Wright as more conservative or the former president’s only ally in the race. Mr. Ellzey has also said he supported Mr. Trump.     “It’s not as if this is a Trump versus anti-Trump kind of race, that’s not what this is,” said         Rep. Dan Crenshaw    (R., Texas), who backed Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Crenshaw said Mr. Ellzey’s military and political experience made him better qualified for the job.     Mr. Trump carried the congressional district by 3 percentage points in November, according to the Cook Political Report. The nonpartisan political analysts noted that Mrs. Wright and Mr. Ellzey were essentially tied in the early voting days before the former president’s endorsement, but that among voters who cast ballots in person on May 1, Mrs. Wright took 25% of the vote, compared with 11% for Mr. Ellzey.     The political arm of the Club for Growth conservative group also jumped in the race on Mrs. Wright’s behalf, spending more than $1.1 million, including on ads attacking Mr. Ellzey’s voting record. The group accused him of voting for a tax increase, referring to a Texas House bill that would have imposed the state’s car rental excise tax on peer-to-peer car sharing services.     Mr. Ellzey supported the bill on initial passage, but was absent for its final House passage, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, which noted that the bill hasn’t gained traction in the state Senate.
