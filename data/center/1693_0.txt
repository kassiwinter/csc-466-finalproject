At the same time, the agency painted a portrait of widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police department, releasing a lengthy report cataloging allegedly unconstitutional police treatment of blacks in the St. Louis suburb. That treatment was driven by a bottom-line desire to increase ticket-writing and court fines to boost revenue for Ferguson’s municipal budget, “rather than by public safety needs,’’ the report said.     The Justice Department’s twin findings cap a widely watched investigation into the events of last August, when         Darren Wilson    shot 18-year-old         Michael Brown    in a confrontation that sparked protests and a national debate about policing.                                               A Justice Department probe launched in the wake of the killing of unarmed teenager last year finds that Ferguson, Mo., routinely violated the civil rights of black residents.

In a speech to employees on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General         Eric Holder    said Wednesday that while some of the accusations against the officer were inaccurate, they quickly took hold in a community that distrusted its police department. The issues raised by the shooting, he said, “are not confined to any one city, state or geographic region.’’     Mr. Brown’s parents said that while they were saddened by the decision not to file charges, they were encouraged that the Justice Department “will hold the Ferguson police department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling.”     Neil Bruntrager, Mr. Wilson’s attorney, said he was disappointed with the explanation given by the Justice Department during the release of its findings.      “I want them to use the same vigor in explaining it as they put into saying they were going to do it,” he said, adding he thought Mr. Holder should have stressed more that the federal authorities’ conclusions substantively matched with the St. Louis County grand jury’s conclusions.      Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Wednesday that the city has fired one employee for sending racist emails and is investigating two others, part of a reform effort. The police department is hiring three new officers and has already hired one African-American female corrections officer and two African-American court clerks, he said.         Justice Department FindingsTwo-thirds of Ferguson residents are African-American, but from 2012 to 2014:  85% of the vehicles stopped by police had African-American passengers  90% of people who received citation from police were African-American  93% of those arrested were African-American  Police were twice as likely to search cars driven by African-Americans than by whites. But they found contraband 26% less often in cars driven by African-Americans        The August confrontation began when Mr. Wilson, riding in a police SUV, saw Mr. Brown and a friend walking in a street and told them to move onto the sidewalk. The two began to argue, and Mr. Wilson said Mr. Brown reached into his vehicle, striking him and trying to grab his weapon. Mr. Wilson fired at Mr. Brown, witnesses said, then got out of the car and fired at him again and killed him.     Federal investigators concluded the claims by some witnesses that Mr. Brown was running away, or had his hands up to surrender, weren’t reliable.     In reviewing the Ferguson police and court system, Justice is urging changes including better tracking of when and why officers write tickets and arrest suspects, increased training and supervision for officers, and an end to using arrest warrants to collect fines.      Federal investigators also said they found more than a half-dozen racist emails sent by current Ferguson police or city employees, including one message that they said depicted President         Barack Obama    as a chimpanzee, and another that made a derogatory joke about a man trying to obtain welfare for his dogs.                                                 The Justice Department found the Ferguson police department displayed sweeping patterns of racial bias and routinely violated the constitutional rights of blacks in the St. Louis suburb.
