      	Lawyers for President Trump petitioned the US Supreme Court Thursday as part of his ongoing bid to keep his tax returns away from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.
Trump is appealing a decision from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which found Vance’s office can enforce subpoenas on Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking eight years of his corporate and personal financial documents.
If the Supreme Court declines to hear the appeal, the ruling stands — allowing Vance’s office to seize the financial records.
Should they take the case, the justices will need to decide whether to hear the arguments during the current term ending in June — or in the next term, which kicks off October 2020. Should they opt to delay until next term, a result is unlikely until after the presidential election in November 2020.
Trump’s legal team has argued he should benefit from blanket immunity from any investigation while in office.
“We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will grant review in this significant constitutional case and reverse the dangerous and damaging decision of the appeals court,” Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow said in a statement.
