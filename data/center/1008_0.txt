The U.S. on Wednesday reported a record 36,880 new coronavirus cases more than two months after its previous record for daily infections, a signal that the country is struggling to contain the pandemic.Wednesday's total is 2,000 more than on Tuesday, when 34,700 new cases of COVID-19 were reported nationally, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.New daily cases in the U.S. had hit a peak at 36,739 cases on April 24 and had consistently been on a downward trajectory for weeks until recent spikes in a slate of states, particularly in those that had enacted aggressive reopening plans.The new surge in cases is focused largely in the South and West, with Arizona, Florida and Texas reporting their largest single-day totals on Tuesday. Cases have risen in nearly two dozen states in total, including California and Washington state, which both received praise after effectively tackling some of the country’s earliest outbreaks.The surge marks a juxtaposition to other states that initially had severe outbreaks such as New York, which has since managed to flatten the curve after implementing stringent social distancing and other health measures. Governors across the country are taking an array of actions to try to blunt the spread of the highly infectious virus, with Gov.

We are NOT currently experiencing a second wave. We have NO intentions of closing Missouri back down at this point in time,” tweeted Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (R). “We continue to monitor our state-specific data on a daily basis, and we remain confident that we are on the road to recovery!”We are NOT overwhelmed.We are NOT currently experiencing a second wave.We have NO intentions of closing Missouri back down at this point in time.We continue to monitor our state-specific data on a daily basis, and we remain confident that we are on the road to recovery!— Governor Mike Parson (@GovParsonMO) June 23, 2020President TrumpDonald TrumpBlack voters are fleeing Biden in droves.

We want to do everything, but they use it to make us look bad.”The surge cannot be explained by increased testing alone, however, as the percentage of people testing positive for the virus has also surged.
