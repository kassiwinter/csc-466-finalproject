         Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam    met with top aides Sunday night amid mounting calls from fellow Democrats to resign over a racist photograph, an episode that has pressured a party that has promoted a zero-tolerance policy against members who have been accused of bigotry and sexual misconduct.No announcements were expected Sunday after the meeting, which included top administration officials of color, a Northam spokeswoman said. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, Democrats have been laying the groundwork to draw a bright line between their party and President Trump on issues of racial injustice and sexual discrimination by purging any members accused of wrongdoing.      But after party leaders urged the governor over the weekend to step down after the photo surfaced from his 1984 medical-school yearbook—showing one person in blackface and another wearing a white Ku Klux Klan uniform—he refused, saying the depiction is horrible but that he isn’t in the photograph. He said earlier that he was in the photo.        
Related        An extended face-off over Mr. Northam’s status risks undercutting a key Democratic message as the 2020 race for the White House gets under way, party officials and advocates said.               “This creates a fissure in the party in how we see ourselves, what we stand for and what we believe in,” said Anton Gunn, a Democratic strategist who advised President         Obama’s    2008 campaign in South Carolina. “This really does undermine the moral high ground of where the Democratic Party wants to put itself in the 2020 cycle, and it’s a shame that the governor of Virginia doesn’t understand that.”     Mr. Gunn, an African-American who grew up in southeastern Virginia, noted that Mr. Northam’s disclosures coincided with the launches of several 2020 Democratic presidential candidacies, including those of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and         Cory Booker    of New Jersey, who are both black. The senators were among a large number of presidential contenders who urged Mr. Northam, a 59-year-old who was elected in 2017 and by law can serve one term, to resign.     “It’s a huge problem for Democrats’ credibility if somebody like Northam is able to stay in office,” said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of Ultraviolet, a women’s advocacy group which has confronted cases of sexual misconduct. “The fact that he hasn’t resigned suggests there must be people around him telling him it’s OK and helping to try to get him out of this, to try to weather this storm.”     On Sunday TV news shows, most Democrats called for Mr. Northam to resign. “The good news is there is zero tolerance, and people do understand that,” said Rep. Karen Bass (D., Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on NBC.     Republicans also called for the Democratic governor to step down, with Virginia GOP Chairman Jack Wilson calling the yearbook photo “wholly inappropriate.”     Any political fallout may first be visible in November, when Democrats hope to gain in state legislature races. Strengthening support among African-Americans also is a priority for Democrats in 2020 after the party’s 2016 presidential nominee,         Hillary Clinton,    struggled to turn out black voters at the same rate that Mr. Obama did in minority districts in key states. With Mr. Trump’s past comments on immigrants and race—including his 2017 remarks that “both sides” were to blame in deadly clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va.—Democrats see an opening to bolster that turnout.     African-Americans account for about 20% of the electorate in Virginia and have been crucial to Democrats’ recent success in the commonwealth, helping the party win the past three presidential elections, the past two gubernatorial campaigns and the past five U.S. Senate contests.     Over the weekend, Mr. Trump weighed in on the Virginia matter, writing on Twitter that         Ed Gillespie,    the GOP candidate whom Mr. Northam defeated handily in 2017, must “be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty” about his opposition-research staff.     In late 2017, many Democrats pushed then-Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota into retirement amid allegations of sexual misconduct, saying they had to take a hard line after criticizing Mr. Trump for his alleged mistreatment of women, which he has denied. That episode has been an issue in the 2020 presidential primary race, with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) having had to defend her role in calling for his resignation.     Former Rep. Jim Moran, a Democrat who represented a Northern Virginia district for more than two decades, said Mr. Northam should have a “second chance” to redeem himself and help Virginians cope with the issue of race. “I think it is a rush to judgment before we know all of the facts and before we have considered all of the consequences,” Mr. Moran said on ABC.     While the Northam scandal could be long forgotten by the time 2020 primaries begin, elections will be held this November in Virginia for all 140 seats in the state general assembly. Republicans hold narrow advantages in both legislative chambers, and Democrats are seeking to win majorities ahead of 2020 redistricting that could determine the boundaries of several U.S. House districts. Mr. Northam could loom large in those races if he’s still in the governor’s mansion.                                                 A photograph on a 1984 medical-school yearbook page of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam showed one person dressed in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.                                                                                                        As state lawmakers continued their calls on Sunday for him to step down, they have limited pressure points beyond that. The state’s constitution allows for impeachment of the governor for “malfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty or other high crime or misdemeanor.” The photograph wasn’t taken while he was in office, and Republicans control the Legislature, which would have to launch such an effort.     Delegate Lamont Bagby, chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, said in an interview that he didn’t “even want to start thinking about that” and that he hoped Mr. Northam would “gracefully resign.”     After initially apologizing, the governor said on Saturday that he was mistaken when he initially said he had appeared in the photograph. Mr. Northam acknowledged, however, that during his mid-20s he had placed some shoe polish on his face while portraying Michael Jackson in a 1984 dance contest in San Antonio. He said he regretted “that I did not understand the harmful legacy of an action like that.”     The news conference, and Mr. Northam’s inconsistent answers, fueled more calls for him to step down as senior Virginia Democrats, including Sens.         Mark Warner    and Tim Kaine, and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, joined the chorus.     If Mr. Northam departs, his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, would become the commonwealth’s second African-American governor. Mr. Fairfax has stopped short of demanding a resignation, saying in a statement that “we must make decisions in the best interest” of state residents.     Former         Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,    a Democrat for whom Mr. Northam served as lieutenant governor, called for Mr. Northam’s resignation and said he expected one soon.     “Once that picture with the black face and the Klansman came out, there was no way you can continue to be governor of the commonwealth of Virginia,” said Mr. McAuliffe, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.     Mr. McAuliffe said Mr. Northam “doesn’t have the ability” to work with the state legislature, pointing out that the state’s black caucus has pledged to remove him if he doesn’t step down.     Mr. Fairfax could run for a full term in 2021 even if he ascends to become governor in Mr. Northam’s place.      —Yuka Hayashi and Reid J. Epstein contributed to this article.
