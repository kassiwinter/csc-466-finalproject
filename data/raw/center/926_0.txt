CAIRO—Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters gathered at a Cairo mosque late Thursday in defiance of a national curfew even as the regime gave its forces live ammunition and the authorization to use it.The preparations position the opposing forces for a Friday showdown, just two days after clashes left more than 600 people dead. Neither side is backing down as the standoff hardens between supporters of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first popularly elected Islamist president, and Egypt's military, which removed Mr. Morsi with popular backing last month. U.S. officials raised fears Thursday that Egypt could follow Syria down a path of civil war. In the direst scenario, they said, an armed civil insurrection in Egypt could create a crescent of instability across the region.     Cairo remained largely quiet Thursday, a day after government forces laid siege to Mr. Morsi's supporters in Egypt's deadliest day in more than two years of uprisings and government overthrows. But by early Friday, the Muslim Brotherhood said government forces were besieging Cairo's Iman Mosque, where hundreds of Brotherhood supporters had congregated. That report couldn't be independently confirmed.               Earlier Thursday, Iman Mosque had emerged as the center of new Muslim Brotherhood protest efforts, as supporters congregated there to mourn and pray after Wednesday's security operation a few miles away, on Raba'a al Adiwiya Square, that left hundreds dead. Corpses arrived at Iman Mosque by the minute, to be laid out inside and prepared for funerals. Families came to check the handwritten lists of what Brotherhood supporters said were the group's dead in the area. Lists hanging on a white poster board outside the mosque's gates showed 231 names of people from as far away as Alexandria.     Meanwhile, sanitation crews probed the ashes of the Raba'a al Adiwiya protest camp—where Brotherhood tents, barber stations and kids' play areas had stood just a day before—collecting piles of rotting food and ripped clothing. Dozens of Egyptians feted policemen with thanks and drinks of cold water. Some, arriving with the air of adventure tourists, filmed videos of the now-charred Raba'a Mosque, which had served as the pro-Morsi protests' center. One head-scarfed woman gleefully called the area "the last cave of the terrorists."     A block away, shopkeeper         Mohammed Basha    stood over a mop and a bucket of sudsy water. Scrubbing the pavement of its rust-colored blood stains, he wished for a return to normalcy.     "I won't dance on the graves of the dead," he said. "I don't want to talk about anything but the future."

In defiance of calls for restraint from Washington and European capitals, Egypt's Interior Ministry announced that it had given its troops stationed around the capital and elsewhere in the country an order to use lethal force when necessary.      "The ministry has given instructions to all forces to use live ammunition in the face of any attacks on establishments or forces within the framework of the regulations of using the legitimate right of self-defense," the ministry said in a statement.     While the Interior Ministry's didn't publicize its orders to surrounding the breakup of Raba'a and Nahda squares on Wednesday, it says its troops opened fire only in self-defense amid armed opponents.     Over the course of the day, meanwhile, Brotherhood supporters gathered at their leaders' urging at the Iman Mosque. About 500 were seen there just before dusk, when the military-imposed curfew was due to begin.      Political uncertainty heightened amid silence from Egypt's government. Neither Egypt's military nor the civilian leaders it appointed last month as the country's interim government gave any statements explaining a strategy for guiding Egypt from its political morass.      There was no sign of Gen.         Abdel Fattah Al Sisi,    the military chief. Prime Minister         Adel Beblawi    attended a scheduled cabinet meeting in which government ministers condemned attacks against Christians. They also discussed problems surrounding the coming harvest season and fuel shortages, according to a statement released on the body's Facebook page.     On Thursday afternoon, attackers set fire to the governor's office in Giza, the administrative territory on the outskirts of Cairo and the site of one of the two protest camps broken up by the military. State television blamed the attack on "Brotherhood elements" but offered no proof.      Elsewhere, pro-Morsi demonstrators in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, came out in force to protest Wednesday's bloodshed. Seven Egyptian soldiers were shot dead by unknown gunmen near the city of al Arish in the Sinai region, according to security forces.     The fatality counts released Thursday by the government—nearly double the toll reported late Wednesday—remained a key point of contention between sides in Egypt's political standoff. Late Thursday, a Health Ministry official told the Associated Press that 638 civilians had been killed across the country on Wednesday—including nearly 300 at the pro-Morsi sit-in at Raba'a al Adiwiya.      Supporters of Mr. Morsi insist that the death toll was more severe, pointing out that the government's body count came only from corpses registered in hospitals. Brotherhood members displayed dozens of other corpses in mosques around Cairo on Thursday, preparing them for burial. These bodies hadn't been handled or counted by morgue or hospital officials, mosque officials said. Some Brotherhood protesters said they stayed away from these facilities for fear of arrest.     In a 20-minute period Thursday evening, men brought 13 bodies to the Iman Mosque, the new central gathering point for Brotherhood supporters who had previously fortified Raba'a square. Several more bodies inside the mosque were being prepared for funerals.      Pockets of sadness among those gathered at the mosque swiftly transformed to anger at the end of the noon prayer, when defiant chanting broke out. "They have the gun, but we have Allah," called members of the congregation.     Many in the crowd started calling for a new revolution to honor Wednesday's dead. The message among those gathered was clear: The Muslim Brotherhood had not been beaten.     "The solution is not to go home. We must continue to show that we are not beaten and justice must come," said a man who identified himself as Adel, an engineer for a state-owned company. He was grazed by a bullet Wednesday at Raba'a square, he said, and was still wearing the same blood-soaked shirt.
