WASHINGTON—President Trump isn’t firing Anthony Fauci, the White House said Monday, seeking to extinguish speculation that flared over the weekend after         Mr. Trump    retweeted a critic who called for the member of his administration’s coronavirus task force to be dismissed after he said lives could have been saved if the government had acted more quickly.“Today I walk in and I hear I’m going to fire him. I’m not firing—I think he’s a wonderful guy,” Mr. Trump said of Dr. Fauci at a White House news conference later Monday. Asked why he retweeted a comment calling for Mr. Fauci to be fired, Mr. Trump said, “It doesn’t matter.” He then said that the tweet represented an opinion, adding that “not everybody’s happy with Anthony. Not everybody’s happy with everybody.”     Mr. Trump also insisted that he and Dr. Fauci have been on the same page from the beginning.               Some on the right have denounced Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and questioned his advice, including whether it helped contribute to the economy’s free fall.     Appearing on CNN Sunday morning, Dr. Fauci said the government “could have saved more lives” if it had moved sooner to impose social-distancing restrictions.     On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a former Republican congressional candidate attacking that comment. “Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could’ve saved more lives,” wrote         DeAnna Lorraine,    who challenged House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        (D., Calif.) in her San Francisco-area district.     Her message went on: “Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large. Time to #FireFauci…”          Mr. Trump didn’t use the words “fire Fauci” but shared Ms. Lorraine’s message with his nearly 77 million followers, one in a string of Easter Sunday posts in which he pushed back on criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.     On Feb. 29, Dr. Fauci appeared on the Today show and was asked about Mr. Trump’s remarks the night before at a political rally in South Carolina, where the president dismissed Democratic criticism of his handling of the crisis as a new “hoax.” Dr. Fauci declined to comment on that but expressed concern about community spread of the virus. One of the show’s hosts asked whether Americans should be changing their habits, such as ending trips to the gym or mall.     “No, right now at this moment there is no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis,” Dr. Fauci responded. “Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times, even on this program…. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.”     Dr. Fauci appeared at Monday evening’s White House press briefing and noted his comments on CNN were in response to a hypothetical question. He stressed that the first time he approached the president with a recommendation for “strong mitigation,” Mr. Trump listened. He said Mr. Trump then listened to his advice to extend the social-distancing guidelines through the end of April.

As he stepped away from the podium, a reporter asked if he was making his comments voluntarily. “Everything I do is voluntarily, please—don’t even imply that,” Dr. Fauci said.     Speculation over Dr. Fauci’s status with the president has risen before, but Mr. Trump relied on the doctor and other medical advisers in part when he backed off a push to see the economy restarted by Easter.     In a March interview on Fox News, Mr. Trump said, “Tony’s extraordinary” and “we get along very well.”        
More        Yet Mr. Trump has at times felt frustrated with Dr. Fauci, aides say. The two have differed on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug the president has repeatedly promoted as a possible treatment for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the pathogen, defying the advice of some public-health experts.     Dr. Fauci has noted there are cases that show the drug might have an effect but others that demonstrate no impact. “I think in terms of science, I don’t think we could definitively say it works,” he said April 5 on CBS.     During a briefing last week, Mr. Trump moved to cut the doctor off from answering a reporter’s question about medical evidence about the drug.     Mr. Trump had been upset by some polling data showing his own approval ratings down while Dr. Fauci’s were high, according to two people familiar with the discussions. A Quinnipiac poll last week put Dr. Fauci’s approval rating at 78% for his handling of the crisis, versus 46% approval for the president.

Mr. Trump was starting to resent Dr. Fauci’s extensive media interviews, two people familiar with the discussions said. But they said they believed Dr. Fauci had to answer the question truthfully on CNN about shutting the country down earlier, because not doing so would have eroded trust in the public-health officials and science behind battling the novel coronavirus.     “I’m worried—scared, frankly—that he and public-health leaders are now going to get attacked,” said one person familiar with the discussions.     Some public-health experts who support Dr. Fauci are concerned the president’s tweet will increase criticism of the science and data driving decisions.     Mr. Trump has been listening more to some advisers and conservatives who say the country has gone too far in implementing coronavirus-related restrictions. People familiar with the discussions said Mr. Trump has been worried about the economic slump and its impact on his 2020 re-election bid. Meanwhile, estimates of coronavirus fatalities have been reduced in recent days because modeling was adjusted down to reflect the effectiveness of social distancing.     Dr. Fauci has given many media interviews, including on nontraditional outlets such as podcasts. He has long enjoyed bipartisan congressional support and has largely been focused on public health rather than politics, according to two people who know him. They said he isn’t used to the glare of political attention, which led to threats that prompted him to be given a security detail this month.                                                 Dr. Fauci listens to President Trump speak during the daily coronavirus task force briefing.

But criticism of Dr. Fauci has persisted, with right-wing conspiracy theorists attacking him online as part of a “deep state” plot to undermine the president’s re-election. Others have said the doctor’s push for Americans to stay at home has been overkill given the economic damage.     “You want to keep Americans from dying before their time, then don’t impoverish them,” Fox News host         Tucker Carlson,    an influential voice with the president, said on his program earlier this month. “For all his credentials, his experience, his apparent personal decency,         Dr. Anthony Fauci    does not seem to understand any of this and we should never let someone like that run this country.”     During his Sunday CNN appearance, Dr. Fauci said medical experts had faced political constraints in trying to push early for a swift response to the virus. “What goes into those decisions is complicated,” he said. “But you’re right, I mean, obviously, if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.”          —Andrew Restuccia contributed to this article.
