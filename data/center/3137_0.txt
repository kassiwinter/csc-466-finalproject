WASHINGTON—Sen.         Al Franken    said Thursday he would resign in the face of sexual-misconduct allegations, underscoring how deeply the Capitol is being shaken by the national reassessment of how men treat women and raising anxiety about which lawmakers could be next to go.Mr. Franken made his announcement in a speech in the Senate floor that put the Minnesota lawmaker face to face with Democratic colleagues who a day earlier had praised his work and friendship but called on him to step aside nonetheless. “Nothing I have done as a senator—nothing—has brought dishonor on this institution,” Mr. Franken said, repeating his past statements that he remembered some of the alleged transgressions differently and denying some of the other allegations outright. But he said it was time to leave. “Today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate.”     Capitol Hill has been awash in claims of sexual misconduct and harassment in recent months.         Rep. John Conyers    (D., Mich.) this week said he would be leaving Congress, after facing calls to step down over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward female staff members, which he denied. Other lawmakers also face accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct.          In another development, the House Ethics Committee is seeking an interview with former congressional staffer Lauren Greene, who alleges she was sexually harassed by Rep. Blake Farenthold (R., Texas) when she worked in his office, Ms. Green’s attorney, said Les Alderman of Alderman, Devorsetz & Hora PLLC Thursday. Mr. Farenthold has denied the allegations.        
More        The steady stream of allegations, culminating in the toppling of a senator as popular with his colleagues as Mr. Franken, shows no sign of abating.     Hours after Mr. Franken’s speech, Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) announced that he too would be resigning due to sexual-harassment allegations.     Mr. Franks, a conservative House member in his eighth congressional term, issued a statement late Thursday announcing he would be leaving Congress in January, after two aides reported he had asked women staff members to be surrogates to carry his children.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) quickly issued a statement after Mr. Franks saying once he was briefed on the reports, he found them credible encouraged the lawmaker to resign.      Amid the moves by the senator and congressman, anxiety rippled through the Capitol Thursday about who might be next. “I firmly believe that some people will be captured in this that aren’t guilty of something because [that’s] the way the stampede starts,” Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.) said at a Council on Foreign Relations interview this week. “And it doesn’t necessarily stop until innocent people are stepped on.”     “People are conflicted,” said said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to House Democratic leaders. “It’s coming so fast and it’s not clear what the standards are or what they are going to be. There is going to be more on a bipartisan basis.”     “And I think what people want to figure out is, is there ever going to be some process or is it everything is an immediate death penalty.”     The continued flow of allegations against Mr. Franken put his Democratic colleagues in a difficult position. They ultimately decided to push him out rather than wait for the outcome of an Ethics Committee investigation that Mr. Franken said he would cooperate with. On Wednesday more than 30 Democrats publicly called for him to resign.     “I think Al’s a terrific guy and everybody should be entitled to their day in court, but for too long we’ve ignored accusations and made people afraid to even raise the possibility,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.).     Democrats have long cast theirs as the pro-women party, and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made cracking the “highest, hardest” glass ceiling a central, personal part of her campaign in a direct appeal to women voters.     Democrats have regularly called Republican President      Donald Trump        unfit for office due to his crude remarks about women and accusations that he sexually mistreated women, which he has denied. Closer to home, Democratic senators were expected to join some Republicans who have vowed to move to expel Alabama GOP Senate candidate         Roy Moore,    should he win next week’s special election. Mr. Moore has denied allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. With Mr. Franken gone, Democrats believe the contrast between the parties’ handling of sexual misconduct would be stronger.     Mr. Franken nodded to that dynamic in his speech. “There is some irony that I am leaving while a man who bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who preyed on young girls runs for Senate with the full support of his party,” Mr. Franken said, alluding to allegations of misconduct against Messrs. Trump and Moore.        
Related        Mr. Franken called himself a “champion of women” who has “earned a reputation as someone who respects the women I work alongside every day.” He added that a “very different picture has been painted of me over the last few weeks, but I know who I really am.”     By drawing a line on Mr. Franken, the party signaled that it would put women’s rights ahead of its own lawmakers.     “Nothing is easy or pleasant about this,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Franken’s Democratic colleague from Minnesota, “but we all must recognize that our workplace cultures—and the way we treat each other as human beings—must change.”     Asked if he worried that drawing a hard line against any type of misconduct could backfire on Democrats, Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.) explained why he called on Mr. Franken to resign. “I think for a number of us, the deciding factor in our decision to urge Al to step down came from the repetition. Not just one isolated or two or three isolated incidents that might be explained away. The number just kept continuing to mount.”     The same senators who said it was time for Mr. Franken to leave also lined up to embrace the senator after his speech Thursday, some wiping their eyes. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) who led the call for Mr. Franken to step down, stood in line.      One Republican, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, was in attendance for the speech and walked over to shake Mr. Franken’s hand afterward.     “He’s my friend and he did the right thing,” Mr. Flake said.     Mr. Franken beat a Republican in 2008 by a narrow 312 votes, the closest margin in Senate history.In that race, calls of sexism dogged him as opponents brought up former racy writings and sketches the candidate had created as an entertainer for Playboy and “Saturday Night Live” that seemed off-tune for a member of the U.S. Senate. His victory gave Democrats the 60 votes they needed to pass the Affordable Care Act. He was handily re-elected six years later.     As a senator, he pushed for mental-health services in school and addressing the “skills gap” to help people find employment. He kept a low profile, often avoiding the national press and refusing to answer questions in the hallway. Still, he had been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.

Mark Dayton, a Democrat, who said Thursday he had made no decision yet but would make an announcement in the next couple of days.     “Events have unfolded quickly, thus I have not yet decided on my appointment to fill this upcoming vacancy,” Mr. Dayton said.     Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith is considered a likely pick. Local newspapers reported that she would be appointed as a short-term “caretaker” who would serve only until the Nov. 2018 special election to fill the remaining two years of Mr. Franken’s term, which expires in 2020.     That would turn the special election into a wide-open contest in a year that is already roiled with political maneuvering in Minnesota. Because Mr. Dayton isn’t running for re-election in 2018, the open governor’s seat has attracted a phalanx of candidates in both parties.     Cook Political Report rated the 2018 race to fill Mr. Franken’s seat a tossup, citing a “very fluid” situation. Also on the ballot in 2018 is Ms. Klobuchar, but she is considered a safe bet for re-election.     —Byron Tau contributed to this article.
