You are incredible people.”      The president’s comments come after the Pentagon announced Monday the death of a U.S. service member in Afghanistan. This year has seen at least 20 U.S. military deaths in the country, the highest in recent years. The Pentagon identified the soldier as 33-year-old         Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble    from Washington Township, N.J., who was with a Special Forces unit, and said he died from injuries sustained during combat. It didn’t provide further details but said the incident is under investigation.      The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing, adding further strain on the fragile U.S.-Taliban talks aimed at ending the 18-year war.               Mr. Trump made the traditional presidential holiday call with members from each branch of the military represented. “I hope every member of our military will feel the overwhelming gratitude of our nation,” he said. Mr. Trump noted that the troops would be getting a pay raise starting Jan. 1 as part of the nearly $1.4 trillion government-funding package that he signed last week. “You’ve earned it,” he said.     Separately, Mr. Trump said he is prepared to deal with any action that North Korea may take, in light of recent threats from Pyongyang about an unspecified “Christmas gift” unless the U.S. eases up on sanctions. Pentagon officials have said that North Korea’s actions could range from a strongly worded statement to a new round of weapons testing.      “We’ll find out what the surprise is, and we’ll deal with it very successfully,” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s see what happens. Everybody’s got surprises for me.”     The president is spending the holidays in Florida with         Melania Trump    and other family members. He is scheduled to return to Washington after the New Year’s holiday.     Asked by a service member what he bought the first lady for Christmas, the president said he still needed to get her a present. “I got her a beautiful card,” he said, adding that they share “a lot of love.” He said, “I’m still working on a Christmas present.”     Last year, the president called members of the military on Christmas morning from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington. He spent the holidays there instead of Florida amid a partial government shutdown due to partisan wrangling over funding for Mr. Trump’s promised border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
