WASHINGTON—The House Judiciary Committee said it would vote Wednesday on whether to hold Attorney General         William Barr    in contempt of Congress, escalating a dispute with the         Trump    administration after Mr. Barr missed lawmakers’ deadline to turn over an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.If the panel, chaired by Rep.         Jerrold Nadler    (D., N.Y.), approves the resolution, as expected, it would then need to be approved by the full House. The contempt measure refers Mr. Barr for possible federal criminal prosecution while also opening more legal avenues for House Democrats to try to force the release of the full report on President Trump and Russian election interference through a civil lawsuit. “The Attorney General’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Mr. Nadler said. “If the Department presents us with a good faith offer for access to the full report and the underlying evidence, I reserve the right to postpone these proceedings.”     The Judiciary Committee had set a Monday deadline for the Justice Department to comply with a subpoena, first issued April 19, for the entire special counsel report as well as underlying evidence. Mr. Barr testified before a Senate panel last Wednesday and had been scheduled to appear before a House panel the next day, but he canceled that appearance over a squabble with House Democrats over the hearing’s format.               Separately, Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday that Mr. Mueller shouldn’t testify before Congress after two days earlier saying that decision should be up to the attorney general. Mr. Barr, for his part, had previously said he had no objection to such testimony, and congressional panels had been working with a representative of Mr. Mueller’s to work that out.      The scheduling of the contempt vote is the latest manifestation of the increasing tension between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats. At issue is Mr. Barr’s handling of the public rollout of Mr. Mueller’s findings on whether Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign coordinated with Russians trying to disrupt the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.      Last week, House Speaker      Nancy Pelosi        accused Mr. Barr of having misled Congress about the findings in recent weeks.        
Share Your ThoughtsHow do you think the standoff between Congress and Attorney General William Barr will be resolved? Join the conversation below.        The Justice Department says it is legally barred from turning over the full report because it contains information obtained by using a grand jury, which is by law secret. It has also maintained that Congress has no right to demand raw evidence gathered in a criminal probe.     Courts have ordered grand jury material to be released to Congress in previous investigations involving presidents, as in during Watergate and the Clinton impeachment. The committee has urged Mr. Barr to request a court unseal the Mueller report—a step he hasn’t taken.     The department has also said it has already accommodated public interest in the report by releasing a redacted version to the public and making a less redacted version available to senior congressional leaders.     The Justice Department on Monday invited congressional leaders to the department for further negotiations over the impasse.      “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law,” said a department spokeswoman.              Rep. Doug Collins    of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary committee, called the action by Democrats “illogical and disingenuous” and suggested that the panel should instead pass legislation allowing grand jury information to be turned over to Congress.                                         The fight between House Democrats and the Trump administration in the aftermath of Robert Mueller's report is getting increasingly tense. What will come next? WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains.

While Mr. Mueller’s report outlined efforts by Mr. Trump to curtail or shut down the probe, the special counsel didn’t pursue charges of obstruction of justice on Mr. Trump, citing in part Justice Department guidance. He also didn’t establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government despite repeated contacts with Moscow-linked entities in 2016.     A contempt citation from Congress of a senior administration official is a rare, but not unheard of, action in disputes over documents or testimony. In most circumstances, the department has policies against bringing criminal charges against its own officials in clashes with Congress and has historically declined to act on such requests.     But moving forward on contempt also paves the way for a potential civil lawsuit to gain access to the report. Courts have rarely had to grapple with the legal boundaries of such disputes. They have generally recognized the right of Congress to compel testimony and documents as part of its oversight function—as well as the right of the executive branch to shield some sensitive material from disclosure to Capitol Hill or the public.     Such litigation could take years.     Former Attorney General         Eric Holder    was held in contempt in 2012 after refusing congressional requests for access to documents about a law-enforcement program called “Fast and Furious.” Mr. Holder invoked the executive privilege doctrine to shield some documents from Congress, provoking the GOP-led panel to hold him in contempt.     The Justice Department unsurprisingly declined criminal contempt charges against its own leader. Republicans then filed a civil lawsuit, in which they prevailed on a number of questions. When it took power, the Trump administration moved to settle the suit and turn over some of the documents—but the case still isn’t fully resolved and a settlement remains pending.     Democrats last week also hinted they could revive a dormant power of Congress called inherent contempt, in which Congress either levies fines or physically detains a recalcitrant witness. Such a step would be unprecedented in modern relations between Congress and the executive branch, though courts have repeatedly upheld the congressional power to arrest witnesses who defy subpoenas.
