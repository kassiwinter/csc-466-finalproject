                                                  Construction crews use barges and cranes as work continues on a replacement for the 58-year-old Tappan Zee Bridge spanning the Hudson River, on Tuesday.          Associated Press                                                                                                                                  Updated May 14, 2014 4:45 pm ET                      President Barack Obama on Wednesday said he would cut red tape for projects to build roads, bridges and other major projects, part of a broader effort to prod Congress toward replenishing the nation's dwindling highway trust fund.     Mr. Obama spoke in Tarrytown, N.Y., near the Tappan Zee Bridge, an aging thoroughfare across the Hudson River that will be replaced with two new spans. The president's remarks, visits to Cleveland and St. Louis by Vice President Joe Biden and an earlier White House report are all meant to ratchet up pressure on lawmakers to approve new transportation funding.      "If they don't act by the end of the summer, federal funding for transportation projects will run out," Mr. Obama said Wednesday. "We'll run out. There will be no money. The cupboard will be bare."                                                                                                                                The Highway Trust Fund, which pays for building and repairing roads, is expected to run dry as soon as August, a development that would force the federal government to cut payments to states, putting thousands of projects and nearly 700,000 jobs in jeopardy, according to the White House.               New funding coupled with the latest effort on permitting, designed to speed projects from design to completion by improving coordination among multiple federal agencies, would create jobs and ultimately encourage businesses to invest in the U.S., Mr. Obama said.     Lawmakers from both parties want to keep funds flowing but disagree over how to raise the money and how much to spend on infrastructure. Because of the approaching November election, Congress may opt for a short-term fix, effectively punting a broader debate until next year.     Republicans met the latest White House push with skepticism.     "It's a real challenge to listen to the president talk about reforming the permitting system when he's been sitting on the permit for the country's largest shovel-ready infrastructure program, the Keystone XL pipeline, for five years," said Senate Minority Leader         Mitch McConnell    (R., Ky.).     The Keystone pipeline would bring oil from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries, creating jobs and boosting energy production. But it also has sparked environmental concerns, leading the Obama administration to repeatedly delay any final decision on approval.
