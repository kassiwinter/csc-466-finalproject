BOSTON—Federal prosecutors charged dozens of wealthy parents—including prominent law and business figures and two Hollywood actresses—with using bribes, bogus entrance-exam scores and faked athletic achievements to get their children admitted to elite colleges.One New York law-firm co-chairman allegedly paid $75,000 to an admissions consultant so his daughter could fly to Los Angeles and take the ACT in a private room last December, accompanied by a proctor who had been paid to correct her errors. Another family allegedly made a $400,000 contribution to a sham charity in 2016, with a portion of the funds funneled to the then-head tennis coach at Georgetown University, in exchange for having their daughter tagged as a recruited athlete. She was admitted to the school.         Related        Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Boston field office, described on Tuesday a “culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for students trying to get into these schools the right way, through hard work, good grades and community service.”               The sprawling case, the result of a 10-month multiagency federal investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues that led to charges against actresses         Felicity Huffman    and         Lori Loughlin,    lays bare a privileged world of high anxiety and high net worth. Operating in a universe where high school graduates are expected to go on to top colleges, a rejection letter isn’t an option.      But with many selective schools boasting record high application volume and record low admission rates—in the low single digits at Stanford University and some Ivy League institutions—admission is far from a sure thing for even the most privileged or qualified.      Beyond paying for legitimate test-prep courses or donating to their alma maters in the hopes of getting a leg up—common practice in some circles—the 33 parents named in federal indictments Tuesday allegedly funneled at least $25 million through a fraudulent college-counseling service to get their children into colleges including Yale University, Stanford and University of California, Los Angeles.          Those charged Tuesday include Ms. Huffman of “Desperate Housewives” and Ms. Loughlin of “Full House”; Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of New York law firm Willkie Farr; former Pacific Investment Management Co. Chief Executive Douglas Hodge; and Greg Abbott, CEO of         International Dispensing Corp.         Also charged was         Bill McGlashan,    founder and managing partner of TPG Growth, the arm of the private-equity firm that invests in fast-growing companies such as Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.     TPG said Mr. McGlashan was placed on administrative leave. A PIMCO spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Hodge’s alleged involvement in the scheme.     Prosecutors said the college-counseling operation, which played out from 2011 until last month, involved paying admissions-test administrators to help students raise their test scores by either having someone else take the test, or correcting answers before they were submitted. Prosecutors also said some of the people bribed varsity coaches and administrators to admit their children as recruited athletes.     Prosecutors said it appeared the universities themselves weren’t involved in the scheme.     The ringleader, college-counseling consultant William Rick Singer, pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes. He admitted facilitating the fraud through the Edge College & Career Network LLC, also known as the Key, in Newport Beach, Calif. Mr. Singer would likely face 15 to 19.5 years in prison under sentencing guidelines.                                         Federal prosecutors charged dozens of people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, in an alleged scheme to help students get admitted to elite colleges under false pretenses. U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling detailed the charges at a press conference.

Ms. Loughlin hadn’t yet been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon.      Ms. Huffman and her spouse—actor William H. Macy, who isn’t named as a defendant—allegedly paid $15,000 to work with the admissions consultant and help one daughter cheat on the SAT in late 2017; Ms. Huffman, who was arrested Tuesday, considered doing the same for her younger daughter but decided against it, according to the affidavit.     A representative for Ms. Loughlin declined to comment. Ms. Huffman couldn’t be reached for comment.                                                  Prosecutors said a women’s soccer coach at Yale accepted a $400,000 bribe in exchange for admitting a candidate as a recruited athlete.

U.S. Attorney         Andrew Lelling    said it remains active, and more parents and coaches could be charged.      Mr. Singer says on his firm’s website that he set up his business 25 years ago to help students navigate the tricky world of college admissions. It is dotted with testimonials to his good work.     In court Tuesday, Mr. Singer admitted it was a sham, but a seductive one for his wealthy clients. Some students can gain admissions through the “front door,” where students get into college on merit, or the “back door” where parents make hefty donations to increase chances of admission. His path offered better odds, he said.                                                 A photo allegedly submitted to the University of Southern California, showing an applicant allegedly playing water polo; the photo is actually of another person.                                                                                                        “I created a side door—a sure thing,” he said. “That is what made it so attractive—I created a guarantee.”      Mr. Singer said Tuesday he would have clients’ children seek doctors’ notes claiming learning disabilities or other issues, which would allow them to take SAT or ACT tests at sites where Mr. Singer could install a proctor who had been paid to either take tests on the students’ behalf or correct wrong answers. He said he bribed test administrators working with sites in Houston and Los Angeles, and parents would fly their children in to take the tests.                                                 A photo allegedly submitted to the University of Southern California, showing a college applicant allegedly pole-vaulting, though the image actually shows someone else.                                                                                                        Those services generally went for $15,000 to $75,000, according to prosecutors, with proctors receiving a small cut.      Two test administrators for the ACT and College Board were charged in the racketeering conspiracy.     Mr. Caplan, a top private-equity lawyer, is among those who allegedly tried the side door. He allegedly paid Mr. Singer $75,000 to have another person take the ACT for his daughter in December, asking that she get a score in the low 30s out of a possible 36—he didn’t want it to be so high as to seem suspicious, according to a conversation recorded by law enforcement.        
More on Higher Education        Mr. Caplan said in another recorded call in July, “I’m not worried about the moral issue here. I’m worried about the, if she’s caught doing that, you know, she’s finished.”     Willkie Farr had no comment, and Mr. Caplan didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.     Mr. Singer also allegedly helped parents work with college coaches to claim admission spots reserved for recruited athletes, staging photos of the teens playing sports or photo-shopping their faces onto stock photos of young athletes and creating fake credentials showing their athletic prowess.     The coaches who allegedly received payments then used the athletic profiles to persuade others at the schools to admit the students, Mr. Lelling said. Most of the coaches both gave money to their sports programs and kept some for themselves, he said.     Coaches and at least one administrator participated in the scheme, prosecutors said. Those charged with racketeering included the former head men’s and women’s tennis coach at Georgetown; a senior associate athletic director, water polo and women’s soccer coaches at USC; the men’s soccer coach at UCLA; and the Wake Forest University women’s volleyball coach.     Wake Forest put its head volleyball coach on administrative leave and retained outside counsel, USC announced an internal investigation and a broad review of its admissions processes, and the University of Texas in Austin placed its men’s tennis coach on administrative leave.     Prosecutors said the head women’s soccer coach at Yale accepted a $400,000 bribe in exchange for admitting a candidate as a recruited athlete, even though she allegedly didn’t even play competitive soccer. After the student was admitted, her parents paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million, including about $900,000 to his charity, which purported to help underserved youth but funneled funds to bribe college officials.     Yale said it is the victim of a crime and would continue to cooperate with the probe.     Georgetown’s former tennis coach didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did the Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith or USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic.      John Vandemoer, the 41-year-old former head sailing coach at Stanford University, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors said there were no allegations he kept the money for himself. According to court records, during the summer of 2017 and the following May, Mr. Vandemoer agreed to designate two of Mr. Singer’s clients as recruits in return for payments, including one of $500,000, to the Stanford sailing program.     Neither student ended up going to Stanford, but Mr. Singer still allegedly paid $160,000 to the sailing program, according to prosecutors. Mr. Vandemoer agreed with Mr. Singer that the payment “would serve as a ‘deposit’ for a future student’s purported recruitment,” the federal documents allege.     In a statement Tuesday, Stanford said Mr. Vandemoer has been terminated and neither student attended the school.

Photo:            mario anzuoni/Reuters                                                                                                             Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Singer’s nonprofit organization, Key Worldwide Foundation, was used as a front for many of the bribes.      Mr. Abbott of International Dispensing and his wife, Marcia, were both charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Mr. Abbott said his family had spoken to the FBI about the alleged cheating scandal, and on Tuesday called the situation “insane.”     Mr. Abbott allegedly made a $50,000 donation to Mr. Singer’s charity last April in exchange for having someone correct their daughter’s answers after she finished taking the ACT, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Prosecutors said the money was wired from an Abbott Family Foundation brokerage account.     Another donation, for $75,000, was made in September, allegedly in exchange for helping the daughter cheat on SAT mathematics and literature subject tests.     “Literally, we were involved with this guy for our daughter to help out with college counseling and he gets f— arrested,” Mr. Abbott said. “We didn’t know he was doing this s—.”     Mr. Abbott said the counseling service had a “sketchy setup” in hindsight but had been recommended to the family.     “A network of New York City mothers use this guy and they all say he’s the best,” he said. “He ruined chances of kids getting into school who did years and years of work to get into school on their own.”     In some cases, the students weren’t aware of what their parents had paid for or that Mr. Singer had hired someone to correct their answers on standardized tests to improve their scores.      “It was so funny ’cause the kids will call me and say, ‘Maybe I should do that again. I did pretty well, and if I took it again, I’ll do better even.’ Right? And they just have no idea that they didn’t even get the score that they thought they got,” Mr. Singer said, according to the affidavit.      —Douglas Belkin, Brian Costa, Jim Oberman and Miriam Gottfried contributed to this article.
