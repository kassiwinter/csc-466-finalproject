Former President         Bill Clinton    and his daughter, Chelsea, plan to stop raising money for the Clinton Foundation and turn over operations to independent parties if Democratic candidate         Hillary Clinton    is elected president, according to people familiar with the plans.The Clintons also plan to discontinue after this year one of the foundation’s signature events, the Clinton Global Initiative,         Mr. Clinton    told the staff at the foundation’s headquarters in New York on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. Next month’s annual meeting aims to draw commitments from corporations, philanthropies and others to seek to remedy global problems such as poverty and AIDS.     The Clinton Foundation also would no longer accept foreign and corporate donations if Mrs. Clinton were elected president, a foundation official said on Thursday.               How the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation would function in the years to come isn’t entirely clear. But plans under discussion are likely to substantially scale back the work of the foundation should Mrs. Clinton win the presidency in November.         More on Election 2016                The planned changes are an attempt to insulate Mrs. Clinton from perceptions that Clinton Foundation donors could benefit from her administration’s official actions, these people and a Clinton campaign official said. Even a scaled-down foundation would mark an unprecedented turn in politics, given what would be the organization’s close identification with the White House.     People briefed on the matter expect that, at least during a Hillary Clinton administration, the family would turn over the reins to nonfamily members. The independence of those people would come under intense scrutiny, given the number of people in the Clintons’ orbit who are considered their friends.     Foundation officials declined to comment on the overall plans.     In June in Atlanta, Mr. Clinton said, “You have to be careful to avoid actual and potential conflicts of interest.” He added, “We’ll think very clearly about it, and we’ll do the right thing and explain it to the American people.”     Many details of the foundation’s plans aren’t known, such as the fate of the $250 million raised for an endowment to secure financing of the foundation into the future. That endowment fund is managed by Summit Rock Advisors, where Chelsea Clinton’s friend Nicole Fox is managing director. Summit Rock didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Chelsea would not and Bill wouldn’t be involved. I don’t think they would want to have any more potential of conflicts,” said a foundation supporter familiar with the plans.     Another person familiar with the plans said, “This will be the last CGI.”     Mrs. Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board and stopped fundraising and giving paid speeches when she announced her bid for president in April 2015. But Mr. Clinton continued giving paid speeches that year, personally earning about $2.8 million, campaign financial disclosure forms show.     One senior Clinton campaign adviser told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Clinton wouldn’t be able to continue to raise money for the foundation if his wife were elected. It remains unclear whether Mr. Clinton would continue to give paid speeches. It would be unprecedented for a president’s spouse to give paid speeches, but it is also unprecedented for a former president’s wife to be president.     “It would be wise for Bill Clinton to put his moneymaking activities on hold and not do any speeches for financial gain,’’ said Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary in Mr. Clinton’s administration. “Even assuming no impropriety, appearances themselves can create problems.”     The Journal has previously reported that 60 companies that lobbied the State Department gave more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation while she was serving as secretary of state. At least 44 of those companies also participated in CGI projects valued at $3.2 billion. In several cases involving UBS AG,         Boeing Co.    ,         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,        General Electric Co.    and         Microsoft Corp.    , the donations came as Mrs. Clinton was taking actions that benefited the companies.                                        “The changes are an attempt to insulate Mrs. Clinton from perceptions that Clinton Foundation donors could benefit from her administration’s official actions.”                                                                                             The Clintons have said that the donations weren’t linked to the actions.     The Justice Department’s public integrity section considered investigating the Clinton Foundation for alleged conflicts of interest, but decided that Federal Bureau of Investigation findings in an initial review didn’t merit a criminal probe, according to people familiar with the discussions.     Ethics experts and past and present public officials said the planned changes at the foundation were necessary and suggested that additional changes might be needed.              Pablo Eisenberg,    a scholar at the Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership at Georgetown University, said the foundation would need a makeover if Mrs. Clinton were elected. Close allies of the Clintons, such as those on the foundation’s board now, also should resign, he said, adding, “The organization should become a public foundation with a new board and professional staff.”           Donald Trump,        the Republican presidential nominee, would also have to navigate possible conflicts of interest if he were elected to the White House. Mr. Trump told the Journal this summer he would separate himself from his real estate and other businesses by putting his ownership into a blind trust, most likely with his adult children as its trustees.     While U.S. presidents and vice presidents aren’t subject to laws that apply to nearly all other federal officials, it is customary for them to put safeguards in place, such as blind trusts, to avoid an appearance of conflicts.     When Mrs. Clinton was offered the job as secretary of state, the Obama administration required that the foundation cease all foreign-government fundraising and check all transactions with the ethics office at the State Department.     There were several lapses in that agreement. The foundation, for example, acknowledged that it broke that agreement when it accepted $500,000 from the government of Algeria for earthquake aid for Haiti in 2010.     The changes by the Clinton Foundation are being planned now because officials need to start making contingency plans to handle annual expenditures of $90 million. It typically raises money from corporations such as         Coca-Cola Co.    , Procter & Gamble and Goldman Sachs, as well as from foreign governments. By comparison, the George W. Bush Foundation had about $50 million in expenditures in 2014.     The annual Clinton Global Initiative, initially planned to last for a decade, is in its 12th year and is one of the costlier parts of the Clinton Foundation, coming in at about $23 million annually on recent tax returns.
