                 | January 12, 2018 01:46 PM                 A new report about crimes committed by illegals finds that younger undocumented immigrants who were eligible for former President Obama’s DACA amnesty program commit far more crimes than other immigrants or U.S. citizens.        In unearthing rare data that details the crimes and sentences of illegals in Arizona, the Crime Prevention Research Center reported that immigrants age 15-35, the general population of the 700,000 in Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, “commit crime at twice the rate of young U.S. citizens.”                           John R. Lott Jr., president of the center, said that if the Arizona data were averaged out nationally, the crime numbers would be stunning.        “If undocumented immigrants committed crime nationally as they do in Arizona, in 2016 they would have been responsible for over 1,000 more murders, 5,200 rapes, 8,900 robberies, 25,300 aggravated assaults, and 26,900 burglaries,” he wrote in the report.        Proponents of letting DACA recipients stay in the United States, the topic of debate in the White House and on Capitol Hill, have often portrayed the illegals as law abiding students and workers.        Those claims however has come under fire by groups armed with new statistics like Lott’s treasure trove.        “Undocumented immigrants are at least 142 percent more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5 percent longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45 percent more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens,” he found.        And it’s worse for DACA-aged illegals.        For example, he wrote, “while undocumented immigrants from 15 to 35 years of age make up about 0.81 percent of the Arizona population, they make up almost 8 percent of the prison population.”        According to his estimates in Arizona:              DACA-age immigrants represent 71.2 percent of the undocumented immigrants in prison.       DACA-age eligible undocumented immigrants are 884 percent more likely to be convicted of crimes than their share of the population.
