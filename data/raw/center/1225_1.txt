       And how truly committed are NBA players to seeing through the massive change they keep referring to?         Wednesday was another historic day in 2020. When the Association suddenly stopped — again. As the WNBA, MLB and MLS followed the NBA’s lead.            Game 5s between Milwaukee and Orlando, the Rockets and Oklahoma City, and the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland never happened. Thanks to the NBA-best Bucks uniting in the name of racial justice and refusing to play a first-round playoff game.         “The past four months have shed a light on the ongoing racial injustices facing our African American communities. Citizens around the country have used their voices and platforms to speak out against these wrongdoings,” the Bucks said in a statement. “Over the last few days in our home state of Wisconsin, we’ve seen the horrendous video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, and the additional shooting of protestors. Despite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action, so our focus (Wednesday) cannot be on basketball.”         The power of those words — inside the NBA’s protective bubble, with TNT unable to televise back-to-back national showcases — is undeniable at this critical and explosive moment in our country’s history.              But if the boycotted Game 5s are rescheduled and still played in a couple days?         If the NBA is back on TVs across the country this weekend?         I’ll say it again: Where is this all going, and what is the real end game?         If the Association’s international superstars and multimillionaire role players truly wanted to use their combined voices to make a stand and enact real change, they would instantly cancel the season and leave the bubble that can’t exist without them.            That truly powerful idea was up for debate entering a Wednesday night meeting, according to ESPN.         It’s incredibly easy to fire off a tweet or post something new on Instagram. Anyone can say they’re not going to do something.         Then again, you would probably be fired from your job if you declared you weren’t showing up for work because you strongly disagreed with something. And you don’t make $37 million a year (not including endorsements and outside business deals) to play forward for the Lakers.         The NBA — which still has an incredibly awkward relationship with China — is still fighting itself. And a multibillion-dollar league driven by about 10 superstars still couldn’t figure out whether it should keep playing basketball in the year 2020, which has moved from crazy to insane.         Black Lives Matter is boldly printed on bubble courts. Equality, How Many More, Say Her Name, I Can't Breathe and Respect Us hover on the backs of jerseys. When the NBA finally resumed play for seeding games after a nearly five-month layoff, the playing of the national anthem became a platform for social change.         But six non-playing teams acknowledged Wednesday that all the slogans, images and statements hadn’t made the desired impact. They also reinforced a theory pushed by outsiders and critics before the bubble began: Maybe the best thing for the NBA in 2020 is not to play.         The daily confusion was highlighted by TNT, which is normally the league’s greatest stage. A preshow advertisement teased two games that weren’t going to be played. Analyst Kenny Smith abruptly walked off the set, pledging solidarity with players. Oklahoma City’s Chris Paul was seen walking with the Rockets’ Russell Westbrook. Shaquille O'Neal agreed with Charles Barkley — a statement in itself — by wondering where the NBA goes from here.            Barkley: “You’ve probably got to cancel the games (Thursday). My question is, what is the game plan after that?”         O’Neal: “What is the next step? Do you say, ‘OK. I’m going to boycott the season?’ Because right now the games are just postponed. Something’s going to happen next week. Something’s going to happen next year. … Are we canceling? Are we postponing? What’s the next plan? And how does this eliminate bad people’s thought process? I’m not sure that canceling a game is going to make a racist person say, ‘Oh, they canceled the game, I’m not going to be racist anymore.’”         Real change takes months, years, decades and centuries.         Real change occurs by voting — in a booth or via the mail.         Real change requires real sacrifice and dedication. Not just deciding you’re not playing the fifth game of a first-round series when your team is up 3-1.         It’s a players league and superstar-driven sport. The NFL and MLB can’t touch the NBA when it comes to union power.         But a month into bubble life, the Association has chosen not to play games. There’s historic power in that choice. If players keep backing up their words with lasting actions.         If the boycotted Game 5s are played like normal in a couple days and the NBA keeps making billions off its talent?         The game will have gone on, and the power of big money will have prevailed. As always.                     brian.smith@chron.com          twitter.com/chronbriansmith
