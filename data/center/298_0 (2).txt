The case that New York prosecutors have leveled against former President      Donald Trump’s        business empire and the company’s finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, is a reminder that corporations not only share rights enjoyed by individuals but they can also be indicted like people too.What are the Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg accused of? The 15-count indictment made public Thursday charges the company and its longtime chief financial officer with evading payroll and income taxes over a 16-year stretch by paying off-the-book benefits to Mr. Weisselberg and other executives.     It alleges that the company skimmed payroll taxes by concealing compensation—in the form of everything from leases on Mercedes-Benz cars, to rent on an Upper West Side apartment, to home furnishings and private-school tuition.               Both Mr. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include felony charges of tax fraud, falsifying records and grand larceny. Notably, the indictment lists the federal Internal Revenue Service as a victim of the alleged theft.

No. The indictment refers to an “Unnamed Co-conspirator #1” aiding the scheme—a person not believed to be the former president—and says other employees benefited from the alleged scheme. But as of now, Mr. Weisselberg is the only employee named in the indictment.     While the indictment casts a shadow over the financial affairs of a conglomeration of business entities under Mr. Trump’s control, it doesn’t say Mr. Trump knew about the fraud or helped to orchestrate it. The broader investigation continues into possible bank, insurance and tax fraud by the Trump Organization and its officers.     Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation a partisan “witch hunt” carried out by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney         Cyrus Vance Jr.         Thursday’s development is likely to put more pressure on Mr. Weisselberg and other executives to cooperate with New York authorities, white-collar defense attorneys have said.                                         The Trump Organization’s Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to grand larceny charges brought by New York prosecutors in a Manhattan courtroom Thursday.

Courts since the mid-19th century have permitted criminal prosecutions of business organizations, according to scholars. The concept of prosecuting a company developed at a time when civil enforcers like the Securities and Exchange Commission were less powerful, making it a useful tool to hold companies responsible for egregious employee misconduct and systemic failures of oversight.          These days, corporate prosecutions are relatively unusual and tend to take aim at closely held companies with few shareholders, according to James Barger Jr., an attorney who specializes in white-collar cases and teaches a course on business crime at the University of Alabama School of Law. Recent corporate prosecutions by the Manhattan district attorney’s office have targeted far more obscure entities, including smaller construction firms accused of wage theft and manslaughter. Larger companies that have faced charges have sometimes resolved investigations by offering up a subsidiary to plead guilty.     New York’s penal code defines the criminal liability of corporations. Like other state’s, New York’s code limits corporate criminal liability to acts by higher-level managers or directors, acting within the scope of their employment on behalf or to the benefit of the corporation. A prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged misconduct was “authorized, solicited, requested, commanded, or recklessly tolerated” by management.     Authorities can criminally charge a company without bringing a criminal case against any one individual and a corporate conviction doesn’t necessarily mean the top people running the company are guilty of the charged offenses.                                                 An indictment charges the Trump Organization with evading payroll and income taxes.

Mr. Weisselberg’s most serious charge—grand larceny in the second degree—carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. But while companies are sometimes treated like people under the law, the Trump Organization itself can’t go to prison if convicted of the charges it faces.     In New York, the punishment for corporations is a fine, sometimes steeper than a comparable civil action. For crimes involving larger sums of money, the state’s statutory limit is double the amount of the corporation’s gain from the commission of the offense.     The stamp of criminal guilt can be the most serious consequence. “There is a stigma attached to corporations that have been criminally convicted,” said Mr. Barger. “People typically don’t want to do business with criminal corporations.”     Who are the main figures in the investigation?
