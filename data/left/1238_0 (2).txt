Tom Coburn said Thursday that he still supports the death penalty, even in light of the botched execution in his home state.  “I think it has a deterrent capability,” Coburn said on “Morning Joe,” while also acknowledging that he still doesn’t “like” capital punishment.  Coburn, a physician, said the Oklahoma execution this week in which the inmate died after 43 minutes was the result of human error.  “Anytime you’re doing anything with the body, things can go wrong,” he said.  ( Also on POLITICO: Oklahoma execution dismays White House)  The Republican senator was referring to the lethal injection of Clayton Lockett, whose bungled execution the White House and others have called inhumane. Lockett reportedly died from a heart attack after suffering a blown vein during the procedure, making it difficult to administer the lethal drugs. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has ordered an investigation into the incident.  Pressed on “Morning Joe,” Coburn conceded that the episode raises questions “about the death penalty and whether or not that, in and of itself, is appropriate and whether you can do that humanely.”  But Coburn said the number of botched lethal injections is “very, very small.”  “Humans make errors,” Coburn said.
