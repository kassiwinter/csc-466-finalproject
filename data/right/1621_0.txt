                 | December 24, 2020 09:54 AM                Lawmakers on Christmas Eve blocked each other’s competing bills that attempted to rectify President Trump’s objections to a massive spending and coronavirus aid package.      Trump has warned he will not sign legislation that bundles $900 billion in coronavirus aid with the $1.4 trillion 2021 government spending bill.             Trump wants lawmakers to make changes to the massive spending package to remove “wasteful” spending and to increase the virus aid stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 for individuals.      Each party attempted quick passage of separate measures that addressed parts of Trump’s criticism of the colossal bill, but since neither passed, lawmakers will have to deal with the impasse on Monday, when the House returns for a rare post-Christmas session.       A temporary government funding bill runs out on Monday. The House planned to return that day to vote on a resolution to override Trump’s veto of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which was delivered to the House Thursday. Now, they'll be forced to come up with a way to keep the government funded if Trump refuses to sign the measure.       "We're not going to let the government shut down," Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said. "We are considering our options and what steps we will take. There are continuing discussions between the speaker and the secretary of the Treasury and the administration."      House Republicans refused to provide consent for a bill offered by Democrats that would amend the legislation to add the $2,000 checks.      "Believe it or not, Democrats agree with the president," Hoyer said. "The $600 is certainly not enough for the individuals who have been struggling these past months, and it’s certainly not enough to boost our economy’s needs."      Democrats blocked Republicans from quickly passing their own measure, which would have returned funding to 2020 levels for the State Department and Foreign Operations. That title of the bill contains billions in foreign aid critics say should not be spent at this time, including $10 million for a gender equity program in Pakistan. Trump earlier this week said the measure is full of unnecessary spending items, and he called it "a disgrace."      Hoyer said Thursday he hopes the president backs off his veto threat.      "I urge him and hope that he will sign the bill," Hoyer said.      Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who appeared with Hoyer following the fruitless floor session, said Trump should sign the bill because aid is desperately needed by people who are suffering the consequences of the pandemic.      "I'm here to say on Christmas Eve, I want the president to know how many people in this country are scared, fearful, and hungry, and we must get a bill done so we are helping Americans," Dingell said.
