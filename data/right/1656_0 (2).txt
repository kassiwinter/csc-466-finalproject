                                                                                                                                         Oregon Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber submitted his resignation Friday amid allegations that his fiancée Cylvia Hayes used their public positions for private gain, accepting money from private environmental nonprofits to pursue green policies in the state.                                                                                                                                                      The announcement has not yet been made public but sources with direct knowledge of the matter told local news station KOIN 6 that Mr. Kitzhaber met with administration officials Friday morning to make his plans known.                                                                                                                                                      Reports surfaced earlier this week that Ms. Hayes had accepted nearly $200,000 in payments from green nonprofits to work on controversial low-carbon fuel standard policies at the same time that the administration was promoting new legislation on the issue.                                                                                                                                                                    Mr. Kitzhaber’s resignation will take effect 10 a.m. Wednesday. Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown is expected to assume the office and become the nation’s first openly bisexual governor.                                                                                                                              “What should be a day of celebration for is turning into a day of reflection and mourning,” Oregon Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli said Friday morning while addressing a gathering of the Oregon Wheat Grower League outside the capitol, The Oregonian reported.                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. Ferrioli told the crowd this morning that he would not attend Ms. Brown’s swearing in but instead planned to return home “to grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens,” The Oregonian reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oregon House Republican Leader Mike McLane called it “a sad day for Oregon.”                                                                                                                   “I take no delight in John Kitzhaber’s resignation but understand his decision,” he said. “House Republicans have remained focused on working for the people of Oregon and that’s where our focus will remain moving forward.”
