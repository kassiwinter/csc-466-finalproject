"She's very talented, very smart, very quick, and I think she's going to be respected by all," the president said at the time. Ms Nauert, who is currently serving as state department spokeswoman, would have replaced Nikki Haley, who announced in October that she would leave the post of UN ambassador by the end of the year.Some had questioned whether Ms Nauert, who has been in government for less than two years and has never specialised in international relations, had sufficient experience to deal with the type of complex foreign policy issues tackled by UN ambassadors.The role has often gone to skilled negotiators and leading names in US foreign policy - past ambassadors have been scholars, diplomats or prominent politicians. Meanwhile, unnamed sources told US media that Ms Nauert took the decision to withdraw after the White House was made aware of an issue following a background check.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ms Nauert had "performed her duties as a senior member of my team with unequalled excellence" and that she will "continue to be a great representative of this nation".
