When we find problems, we’re addressing them head on, not sweeping them under the rug."Sessions's comments came amid allegations by some Republicans of pervasive bias at the FBI, a notion fueled by the release of text messages exchanged between two FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, expressing sentiments critical of President TrumpDonald TrumpHillicon Valley — Cyberattack hits Ukrainian defense On The Money — GOP senators block Biden's Fed picks Florida county clerk's typo directed ticketed drivers to site selling Trump merchandise MORE.Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerAn unquestioning press promotes Rep.
