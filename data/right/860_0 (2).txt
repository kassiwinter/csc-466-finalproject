                                                                                                                                         President Obama called Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi late Monday night to express his concerns about violence against women in  anti-government demonstrations and to give Mr. Morsi some advice about  running a democracy.                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Obama “underscored his deep concern about violence during the  demonstrations, especially sexual assaults against female citizens.” He  told Mr. Morsi “to make clear to his supporters that all forms of  violence are unacceptable.”                                                                                                                                                      Amid widespread demonstrations against the new government, the Egyptian military told Mr. Morsi late Monday that it will take over in two days if he doesn’t address the protesters’ concerns adequately.                                                                                                                                                                    While on a visit to Tanzania, Mr. Obama told Mr. Morsi that  “democracy is about more than elections; it is also about ensuring that  the voices of all Egyptians are heard and represented by their  government, including the many Egyptians demonstrating throughout the  country.”                                                                                                                              The White House said Mr. Obama “encouraged” Mr. Morsi to show that  he is responsive to protesters’ concerns, and he “underscored that the  current crisis can only be resolved through a political process.”                                                                                                                                                       Mr. Obama also told the Egyptian leader that he is “committed to  the safety of U.S. diplomats and citizens in Egypt and stressed his  expectation that the government of Egypt continue to protect U.S.  diplomatic personnel and facilities.”
