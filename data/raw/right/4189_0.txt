 It's no secret that the media is often overtly in President Obama's corner, but it's still a little shocking to come across evidence of their efforts to make the Right look bad. Case in point: this clip that The Right Scoop found, which appears to feature reporters coordinating their efforts to trip up Mitt Romney during his press conference, after giving a statement on the violence in Libya. The transcript: UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: …pointing out that the Republicans… *unintelligible* …Obama….
CBS REPORTER: That’s the question.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: *unintelligible*
CBS REPORTER: Yeah that’s the question. I would just say do you regret your question.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Your question? Your statement?
CBS REPORTER: I mean your statement. Not even the tone, because then he can go off on…
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And then if he does, if we can just follow up and say ‘but this morning your answer is continuing to sound…’ – *becomes unintelligble*
CBS REPORTER: You can’t say that..
**Later**
CBS REPORTER: I’m just trying to make sure that we’re just talking about, no matter who he calls on we’re covered on the one question.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you stand by your statement or regret your statement? Indeed, as Katrina Trinko at the National Review pointed out, most of the questions Romney faced at his presser surrounded the "controversy" over his remarks, rather than the actual foreign policy crisis at hand. It's sad to think that the press is so invested in taking him down, they're ignoring the larger story at hand -- that of a massive national security disaster, and whether it could have been avoided.
