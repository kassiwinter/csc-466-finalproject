    The White House and union leaders are using Labor Day reinvigorate efforts to raise the minimum wage.     Legislation to increase the federal pay floor from $7.25 an hour stalled in Congress this spring, but Democrats hope the issue will resonate with voters in November, especially in states with closely contested Senate races.      "Raising the minimum wage would be one of the best ways to give a boost to working families," President         Barack Obama    said Saturday in his weekly radio address. He pointed to stronger job creation gains this year but noted many workers are in low-paying jobs.     Raising the federal minimum wage "would help around 28 million Americans from all walks of life pay the bills, provide for their kids, and spend that money at local businesses," he said.  "And that grows the economy for everyone."          Congress has not heeded the president's call. A bill that would have lifted the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour failed to pass the Senate earlier this year. And Republican House Speaker         John Boehner    indicated a similar measure wouldn't be introduced in his chamber, arguing raising the wage will cost the country jobs.     Republicans are generally skeptical that minimum-wage increases support economic growth. They point to a February report from the Congressional Budget Office that found an increase to $10.10 an hour would reduce employment by about 500,000 jobs. The same CBO report found such an increase would lift almost a million Americans out of poverty.     "The American people want it to be easier to find a good-paying job," Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said in a speech this spring. "The Democratic proposal…will eliminate 500,000 jobs."     Mr. Obama attempted to rebuff Republican concerns in his radio address, saying states that have acted on their own to raise the minimum wage have recorded stronger job growth than states where the rate hasn't increased.     However, a July study from the right-leaning American Action Forum found employment growth specifically in restaurant and retail jobs—fields most likely to pay the minimum wage—was slower in those states with newly raised minimum wages.     The exact effect of minimum-wage increases is difficult to discern because broader economic trends and company-specific concerns may play a greater role in hiring decisions. Last year, less than 5% of hourly workers were paid the federal minimum wage, according to the Labor Department.     Raising the minimum wage enjoys relatively strong support among voters. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in early August, 60% of respondents said addressing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would have a "positive" effect on the economy.     The minimum-wage debate cooled in July and August after a very active start to the year. In the first half of 2014, 11 state legislatures voted to enact wage increases. And in June, Seattle's city council approved a $15 an hour minimum wage, setting the highest rate in the country.
The debate is poised to intensify again with initiatives in Alaska and South Dakota asking voters to approve minimum-wage increases in November elections. A similar effort is pending in Arkansas. In each of those states, a Democrat-controlled Senate seat is also at risk.     AFL-CIO union President         Richard Trumka    was in Alaska last week, urging members to vote in favor of the wage increase in November. He also voiced is support for an increase Thursday at an event in Washington.     "We need to increase the minimum wage as quick as we can do it, and it will help the economy," he said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. "It will help put some upward pressure on wages just above the minimum wage and help create additional demand."        Copyright ©2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
