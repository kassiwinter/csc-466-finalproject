Committee vs commission: Expect findings, regardlessFor weeks Nancy Pelosi has been telegraphing that she would create a special congressional committee to investigate the attack. After Senate Republicans banded together to block an independent commission, a "select committee" was her most obvious play.It will allow her to hand pick the participants of the investigating body, rather than rely on an existing congressional committee whose membership is already determined. It will also, of course, permit the Republican leadership to pick its members - virtually guaranteeing the presence of some of the more pugnacious conservatives, such as Jim Jordan of Ohio.Republicans are already accusing Democrats of making this investigation a partisan affair - a criticism that could have been defused under an independent commission. Instead, this may more resemble the committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, which held days of hearings.That investigation was also dismissed as a partisan inquisition, but it did unearth the existence of the private email server Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state - a revelation that would eventually take a political toll.Many Republicans fear an investigation could be used to damage them politically before important 2022 congressional elections, known as the midterms.Media caption, When a mob stormed the US capitolIn the Senate last month, six Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats to launch the commission, but it was four short of the number needed to advance the bill.The vote to reject the bipartisan commission was seen as a test of Republican loyalty to Mr Trump. He still wields significant influence among Republican lawmakers and is widely tipped to run for the next presidential election in 2024.A Senate report released earlier this month touched on security and intelligence failures surrounding the attack but, notably, did not discuss the role of Mr Trump.More on this story
