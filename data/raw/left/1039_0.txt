  Larry in Houston"Fight" ?  why would anyone in congress use that word ? Didn't use to be that way. You hardly ever heard of the word fight. Why don't the good 'ol boy "mitch" use the words : "we'll try to be bi-partisan, on this or that ??" amazing, those people will never change. I guess it's a good thing Boehner is still spkr – Can u imagine if McConnell & Boehner switched positions ? I mean, can u imagine IF Mitch was the Speaker ?? LOL – Hate to be a bearer of bad tidings, but he's NOT a crybaby, and he won't shed ANY Tears, after he breaks it off in Obama. ( or at least , trys to )
Bottom Line is this : Boehner has Showed the Democrats he can Cave. McConnell Won't, or will Never do that.
SO – what does this mean ? It means that NOW the Dems can push Boehner to his limits, til he shows Tears. ( They know he will end up caving)    	January 4, 2013 09:28 am at 9:28 am |
