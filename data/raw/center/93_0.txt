HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s Airport Authority has canceled all flights not yet checked in by Monday afternoon, the agency said, as anti-government protesters peacefully demonstrated at the airport for a fourth day.“Other than departure flights that have completed the check- in process and the arrival flights already heading to Hong Kong, all other flights have been canceled for the rest of today,” the authority said in a statement.Traffic on roads to the airport was very congested and car park spaces were full, the authority said.The increasingly violent protests have plunged Chinese-ruled Hong Kong into its most serious crisis in decades and presented a serious challenge to Beijing.Reporting by Felix Tam, Clare Jim, Twinnie Siu; writing by Farah Master; editing by Darren Schuettlerfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up
