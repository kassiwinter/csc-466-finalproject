The attorney general’s office is also seeking $2.8 million in restitution, penalties, and a ban on Trump and his three oldest children serving on the board of any other New York nonprofit. 
"We'll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law," Underwood said.A New York State Supreme Court judge allowed the case to move forward last month after a motion from the foundation to have it dismissed.
